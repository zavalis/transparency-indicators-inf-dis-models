                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>With enough advanced notice, dengue outbreaks can be mitigated. As a climate-sensitive disease, environmental conditions and past patterns of dengue can be used to make predictions about future outbreak risk. These predictions improve public health planning and decision-making to ultimately reduce the burden of disease. Past approaches to dengue forecasting have used seasonal climate forecasts, but the predictive ability of a system using different lead times in a year-round prediction system has been seldom explored. Moreover, the transition from theoretical to operational systems integrated with disease control activities is rare.</p>

                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>We introduce an operational seasonal dengue forecasting system for Vietnam where Earth observations, seasonal climate forecasts, and lagged dengue cases are used to drive a superensemble of probabilistic dengue models to predict dengue risk up to 6 months ahead. Bayesian spatiotemporal models were fit to 19 years (2002–2020) of dengue data at the province level across Vietnam. A superensemble of these models then makes probabilistic predictions of dengue incidence at various future time points aligned with key Vietnamese decision and planning deadlines. We demonstrate that the superensemble generates more accurate predictions of dengue incidence than the individual models it incorporates across a suite of time horizons and transmission settings. Using historical data, the superensemble made slightly more accurate predictions (continuous rank probability score [CRPS] = 66.8, 95% CI 60.6–148.0) than a baseline model which forecasts the same incidence rate every month (CRPS = 79.4, 95% CI 78.5–80.5) at lead times of 1 to 3 months, albeit with larger uncertainty. The outbreak detection capability of the superensemble was considerably larger (69%) than that of the baseline model (54.5%). Predictions were most accurate in southern Vietnam, an area that experiences semi-regular seasonal dengue transmission. The system also demonstrated added value across multiple areas compared to previous practice of not using a forecast. We use the system to make a prospective prediction for dengue incidence in Vietnam for the period May to October 2020. Prospective predictions made with the superensemble were slightly more accurate (CRPS = 110, 95% CI 102–575) than those made with the baseline model (CRPS = 125, 95% CI 120–168) but had larger uncertainty. Finally, we propose a framework for the evaluation of probabilistic predictions. Despite the demonstrated value of our forecasting system, the approach is limited by the consistency of the dengue case data, as well as the lack of publicly available, continuous, and long-term data sets on mosquito control efforts and serotype-specific case data.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>This study shows that by combining detailed Earth observation data, seasonal climate forecasts, and state-of-the-art models, dengue outbreaks can be predicted across a broad range of settings, with enough lead time to meaningfully inform dengue control. While our system omits some important variables not currently available at a subnational scale, the majority of past outbreaks could be predicted up to 3 months ahead. Over the next 2 years, the system will be prospectively evaluated and, if successful, potentially extended to other areas and other climate-sensitive disease systems.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Dengue is a mosquito-transmitted viral infection spread by <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in urban and peri-urban environments in tropical and subtropical countries [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. About half of the global population is at risk of dengue transmission [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Dengue infection is characterised by flu-like symptoms that may include sudden intermittent high fever, retro-orbital pain, muscle and joint pain, severe headache, and widespread red skin rash. Its treatment typically includes the supportive care of symptoms. There is no specific antiviral treatment for dengue, and efforts to control transmission focus on controlling vector populations [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A live, attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine has demonstrated efficacy in 2 large-scale Phase III trials [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and has now been licensed. However, while the vaccine shows high levels of protection against disease in people with previous exposure to dengue viruses, it may increase the risk of severe dengue if given to seronegative individuals [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A lack of reliable and scalable tests for seropositivity currently hinders wider rollout of the Dengvaxia vaccine and so most countries still primarily rely on insecticide-based mosquito control interventions to limit dengue virus transmission [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The increasing resistance to insecticides highlights the need for targeted and effective interventions [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Vietnam is particularly affected by dengue with an estimated burden of about 2 million yearly infections [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], although, on average, only 95,000 cases have been reported annually to the Ministry of Health over the period 2002 to 2020. Underreporting may be due to 2 main factors. First, dengue surveillance in Vietnam is mostly passive, relying on clinical cases reported by patients seeking healthcare [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Second, up to 80% of the cases may be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and will likely not seek healthcare [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The economic impact of dengue in Vietnam is estimated to be US$30 to US$95 million per annum [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Dengue in Vietnam is primarily spread by <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and, to a lesser extent, by <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>In Vietnam, dengue is characterised by strong seasonality and substantial interannual and spatial variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003542.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). Dengue exhibits different behaviour in different parts of the country. In the north, where temperatures are lower than in the rest of the country, most provinces have few or no cases. An exception is Hanoi, which has reported, on average, about 8,700 dengue cases per year over the past 10 years. In central and southern provinces where temperatures are warmer, many provinces report thousands of cases annually, albeit with large interannual variation.</p>
              <p>Dengue control in the country primarily involves community engagement and mobilisation to reduce breeding sites and outdoor low-volume insecticide spraying in the vicinity of reported dengue cases to kill adult mosquitoes [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. One limitation of dengue control measures is that they are essentially reactive, meaning they take place after cases have occurred. Thus, vector control, dengue diagnosis, and reporting all suffer delays which vary across time and space [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This situation hinders the timely generation and communication of information on when and where transmission occurs, limiting the ability of health professionals to plan and execute control measures.</p>
              <p>If accurate predictions are available, public health decision-makers and planners could design, implement, and target interventions to the most at-risk places in a timely fashion. Disease models driven by Earth observations have been valuable for predicting dengue risk ahead of time, supporting decision-making in multiple settings [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Climate variation is one of the main drivers of dengue ecology. It is known that temperature regulates the development, biting, reproduction rates, and the spatial distribution of <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The titre and replication of dengue viruses within mosquitoes is temperature dependent [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For example, rising temperatures increase dengue transmission to an optimum range of 26 to 29°C [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and large diurnal temperature ranges (DTRs; above 20°C) reduce transmission and increase mosquito mortality [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Mosquito survival is also affected by humidity. Research indicated that <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> eggs survive across a wide range of humidity and temperature combinations. However, <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> eggs experience high mortality when relative humidity is lower than 95% if temperatures are above 22°C [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Under high humidity conditions (i.e., above 80%), adult mosquitoes survive and remain active by replenishing transient body fluid depletion with plant sugars and host blood [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This behaviour is also observed in lower humidity environments, although to a lesser extent [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The effect of precipitation on dengue is related to the creation or flush away of mosquito breeding sites [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The effects of wind speed have been seldom explored in the literature. However, research suggests that wind speed reduces the biting activity of mosquitoes, reducing dengue risk [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Most of the effects of climate on dengue incidence are delayed by 1 to 2 months due to their effect on the life cycle of both mosquitoes and the dengue virus [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, the climatic conditions just before the transmission season starts may be indicative of dengue incidence in the following dengue transmission season [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
              <p>Multiple studies have highlighted the potential usefulness of seasonal climate-driven epidemiological surveillance for decision-making and planning [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These studies have used subseasonal (i.e., between 2 weeks and 2 months ahead) forecasts to inform disease models and compute predictions of dengue risk. There has been limited progress in using subseasonal to seasonal climate forecasting to compute prospective forecasts on a routine basis. There are several challenges for implementing operational and sustainable subseasonal (henceforth seasonal) early warning systems [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Some of these challenges include the lack of multi-decadal health data sets with which to train and validate seasonal climate-driven early warning systems, the common mismatch of scales between climate data outputs and data used for decision-making, and a general lack of consensus as to how to communicate uncertainties to users [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
              <p>Dengue early warning systems driven by Earth observations and seasonal climate forecasts have been proposed using a range of modelling approaches [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], including autoregressive integrative moving average (ARIMA) [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], point forecasts [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical models [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and machine learning [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Often, models are validated using block cross-validation to select the model specification with the lowest out-of-sample predictive error [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This approach takes advantage of all available data to make repeated out-of-sample model predictions, which increases the robustness of model adequacy and verification statistics. One drawback of this method is that it does not preserve the time ordering of the data. Also, predictions are computed for some time periods using a model trained on data from a later time period [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>
              <p>Previous dengue risk prediction studies have relied on outputs from 1 or 2 competing models [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, combining forecasts from multiple competing models into a superensemble may result in more accurate predictions than those from any individual model [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The use of model superensembles for the development of dengue early warning systems has been seldom explored. Moreover, predictions are typically made for a selected year or month [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] rather than for a series of lead times into the future, or a whole season [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In some cases, systems are designed exclusively for research purposes in isolation from relevant stakeholders who may become potential users. This situation is partly due to the difficulties related to the integration of these systems into existing public health procedures and occasional lack of technical expertise.</p>
              <p>Typically, dengue early warning systems are based on deterministic models [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] which may underrepresent heterogeneity and stochastic cessation of transmission. However, decision-makers are increasingly interested in understanding the uncertainties related to the models used to develop decision-support tools and in the probabilities that an event of public health concern may or may not take place [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Spatiotemporal probabilistic models have the advantage of being able to quantify the probability that an event (e.g., an outbreak) may occur at specific times and for specific locations. Public health officials may be more inclined to take action if the probability of observing an outbreak exceeds a certain value [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Both modellers and decision-makers should pay attention to and agree on the definition of outbreaks thresholds so that model predictions are a useful guide for planning and decision-making.</p>
              <p>In several countries, including Vietnam, outbreaks are defined using a so-called endemic channel [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], which corresponds to the mean number of cases per month or season over a long-term period [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In Vietnam, endemic channels are defined for each province using the last 5 years of dengue surveillance data. Outbreak years are removed from the computation of the endemic threshold. When dengue cases exceed the mean plus 2 standard deviations, an outbreak is declared. One limitation of this approach is that often, outbreak years are removed arbitrarily or quasi-quantitatively to increase the sensitivity of the outbreak threshold [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In areas where dengue incidence is typically low (e.g., less than 10 cases per month), the endemic channel may be frequently exceeded, generating statistical alarms of little public health importance [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Despite these limitations, endemic channels are widely used for dengue control decision-making in a variety of countries and provide a practical decision point around which forecasts can be targeted [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p>
              <p>Here, we introduce a superensemble of probabilistic spatiotemporal hierarchical dengue models driven by Earth observations and seasonal climate forecasts. The model framework was codesigned with stakeholders from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Development Programme, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health, the Pasteur Institute Ho Chi Minh City, the Pasteur Institute Nha Trang, the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology Tay Nguyen (TIHE), and the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE). The system is designed to generate monthly estimates of dengue risk across Vietnam (331,210 km<sup>2</sup>) at the province level (<italic>n</italic> = 63) in near-real time (i.e., current time minus processing time). The superensemble is used in an expanding window time series cross-validation (TSCV) framework [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] to generate probabilistic dengue forecasts, which allow us to calculate the probability of exceeding predefined dengue outbreak thresholds for a forecast horizon (i.e., lead time) of 1 to 6 months.</p>
              <p>The superensemble constitutes the dengue fever component of a forecasting system called D-MOSS (i.e., Dengue forecasting MOdel Satellite-based System). The system operates using a suite of Earth observation data sources from satellites and has its first implementation in Vietnam. Vietnam is divided into 63 provinces which are subdivided into 713 districts and has an estimated population of 95.5 million people. The D-MOSS system produces results at the province level and is accompanied by an assessment of its predictive ability that is applied consistently across the whole of Vietnam. The intention is to give an overall evaluation of the performance of our method, rather than an assessment that pertains to the characteristics of any particular province.</p>

                <p>Spatial random effects were specified using a Besag–York–Mollie model [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], which incorporates a spatial effect with a Gaussian exchangeable prior to account for unstructured variation and a spatial effect with an intrinsic conditional autoregressive prior to account for spatially structured variability. Delayed effects of meteorological factors on dengue were accounted for by incorporating a 3-month moving average of temperature, precipitation, specific humidity, and DTR centred at lag of 1 month (i.e., each value is given the average of lag 0 to a lag of 2 months). Sea surface temperature anomalies in the Niño region 3.4 were lagged 0 to 3 months based on previous research [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and exploratory analyses.

                <title>Model selection</title>
                <p>The best subset of seasonal climate predictors leading to the lowest observed prediction discrepancies for a given model was obtained using an expanding window TSCV algorithm [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Land cover variables were included in all competing models as they varied annually and are unlikely to change significantly at monthly time steps. We iteratively fitted all possible models containing 1 seasonal climate predictor at the time, then 2 seasonal climate predictors, and so on, until all seasonal climate variables were included in a full model [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, we tested 128 unique model specifications across 114 forecast months (i.e., January 2007 to December 2016). The predictive ability of each model was evaluated using the CRPS which generalises the mean absolute error for the case of probabilistic forecasts. The advantage of the CRPS compared to the mean absolute error (MAE) or root mean squared error (RMSE) is that the CPRS does not focus on a specific point of the probability distribution of the forecasts, but on their distribution as a whole. CRPS values were computed in R using the <monospace>SpecsVerification</monospace> package [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In response to peer review comments, we also evaluated the bias of the forecasts with the lowest CRPS to investigate whether models systematically over- or underpredicted dengue counts [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].

                <title>Prospective lagged dengue cases</title>
                <p>The number of dengue cases occurring at time <italic>t</italic> is directly dependent on the number of cases that occurred in the recent past. Previous research suggests that including the logarithm of the number of cases in the previous month log(<italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>t</italic>−1</sub>) helps accounting for such temporal correlation in disease transmission [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Additionally, incorporating log(<italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>t</italic>−1</sub>) as a covariate improves the predictive ability of seasonal climate-informed disease models by reducing residual dispersion [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. One complication of accounting for the number of cases in the previous month in an operational system is that log(<italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>t</italic>−1</sub>) in the temporal window of the forecast can only be known up to time <italic>t</italic>+1. More specifically, to generate dengue forecasts 1 month ahead, log(<italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>t</italic>−1</sub>) for time <italic>t</italic>+1 corresponds to the logarithm of the number of dengue cases at time <italic>t</italic>. We used a GLMM with a negative binomial specification to estimate the log(<italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>t</italic>−1</sub>) for time <italic>t</italic>+1 to time <italic>t</italic>+6 to ensure that the number of cases in the previous month were exactly the same for all competing models.

Stacking involves averaging predictions from multiple models using weighted averages. We found model stacking outperformed Bayesian moving average. Therefore, this technique was adopted for the final version of the system. Stacking was performed in 3 stages [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. On the first stage, we simulated 1,000 samples from the posterior distribution of dengue cases for each of the best performing models and the baseline model. Then, we calculated their CRPS for the historical period comparing the samples against observed dengue counts. In the second stage, optimal weights [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] were calculated for each model as follows:

                <p>The predictive ability of the model for outbreak detection was evaluated using the Brier score [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. For the Brier score, smaller values indicate better predictions. Four moving outbreak thresholds were defined to evaluate the predictive ability of the superensemble for outbreak prediction: (i) the endemic channel plus 1 standard deviation; (ii) the endemic channel plus 2 standard deviations; (iii) the 75th percentile of the distribution of dengue cases per month; and (iv) the 95th percentile of the distribution of dengue cases per month. The endemic channel was calculated as the number of dengue cases per month and per province over the previous 5 years in agreement with current practice at the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. The 75th and 95th percentiles were calculated over the whole observational period at each time step. We then calculated the probability of exceeding the moving outbreak threshold generating 1,000 samples from the posterior distribution of the point forecasts to reflect forecast uncertainty. The Brier score was calculated as follows:

                <title>Relative value of using a forecasting system</title>
                <p>Unlike other measures, the relative value (<italic>V</italic>) of the forecasts generated by the superensemble depends on requirements set by the user [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Typically, <italic>V</italic> is evaluated in monetary terms and is particularly useful when the probability of occurrence of an adverse event (e.g., a major outbreak) is known. If the probability of occurrence of an outbreak is greater than the ratio of the cost of taking preventive action divided by the loss incurred by not taking action (C/L ratio) and an outbreak occurs, then it will pay off to take action. If the probability of occurrence of an outbreak is lower than the C/L ratio, then it does not pay off to take preventive action. If the probability is equal to the C/L ratio, it does not matter if action is taken or not. Our analysis provides an initial screening process to identify areas where a forecast is most likely to be cost-effective and thus, target of comprehensive economic evaluation studies in the future.</p>
                <p>Given that data on the cost of taking preventive action and on the losses incurred by not taking action were unknown to us at the time of writing this manuscript, <italic>V</italic> was estimated for a range of theoretical C/L ratios following [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] by comparing the mean cost of using the forecasting system for outbreak detection compared to the mean expense incurred by either never preventing outbreaks or, on the contrary, taking preventive action every month of the year. <italic>V</italic> takes a value of 1 if the forecast is perfect and a value of 0 if it is no better than the default action plan.

                <title>Model superensemble evaluation</title>
                <p>The 5 models with the lowest CRPS values (i.e., best performing) and the baseline model were used to generate a superensemble. It is noted that the 5 best performing models were the only models with a CRPS below 90 when computing prospective predictions. For CRPS, lower values indicate a smaller difference between the forecasts and the observations. There was strong seasonal variation in the weights assigned to each model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003542.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). All competing models had similar weights across the whole evaluation period (January 2007 to December 2016), whereas the baseline model had the lowest weights. We note that the weights assigned to the baseline model gradually decreased with time.</p>
                <p>Averaged across all lead times, the superensemble led to slightly lower CRPS values than each of the competing models, including the baseline (<xref rid="pmed.1003542.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, when stratified by lead time, the superensemble outperformed the competing models at all time leads but only outperformed the baseline at leads of 1 to 3 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003542.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The uncertainty of the forecasts increased with lead time. This is also evident when using the CRPSS for which values above 0 (indicating better predictions) were observed for the superensemble only for leads 1 to 3 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003542.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The CRPSS can be interpreted as the relative improvement observed from using a model compared to a reference baseline. Thus, a value of 0.4 would suggest that the values from a given model have an absolute error that is 40% smaller than the absolute error of the baseline model. The CRPSS indicates that at a lead time of 1 month, the superensemble and the competing models outperform the baseline by about 42%, whereas at a time lead of 6 months, their absolute error is 12.5% larger than that of the baseline model.</p>

                <p>Across all metrics, the predictive ability of the superensemble deteriorated as the forecast horizon increased from 1 to 6 months. This situation is also evident where the forecast ensemble mean and its 95% credible interval (i.e., the interval in the domain of the posterior probability distribution) are plotted against the observed number of dengue cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003542.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). Notice that the accuracy of the predictions worsens as the forecast horizon expands. We noted that the credible intervals of the predictions gradually became narrower as the number of months used to train the models increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003542.s005">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
                <p>The predictive ability of the superensemble also varied with the month of the year.

                <p>Predictive ability was also evaluated by comparing the predicted probability of predicting outbreaks using the Brier score and 4 moving outbreak thresholds. Observed outbreak months were defined as months where the number of predicted dengue cases exceeded outbreak thresholds. As expected, highest predictive ability was achieved at a lead time of 1 month, after which the predictive ability of the superensemble gradually declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003542.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Across the forecast horizon, the highest predictive ability was observed when using an outbreak threshold based on the endemic channel plus 2 standard deviations, closely followed by the 95th percentile. Stratified by month of the year, the predictive ability of the superensemble was generally greater between April and September for all thresholds except for the 75th percentile. When stratified by month, predictive ability was also larger using the endemic channel plus 2 standard deviations closely followed by the 95th percentile of the distribution of dengue cases.</p>

                  <p>The model superensemble was driven by seasonal climate forecasts to generate dengue forecasts for the period May to October 2020 using near-real time seasonal climate forecast data from the UK Met Office Global Seasonal forecasting system version 5 (GloSea 5) [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. For the historical period (i.e., August 2002 to April 2020), the superensemble made slightly more accurate predictions (CRPS = 66.8, 95% CI 60.6 to 148.0) than a baseline model which forecasts the same incidence rate every month (CRPS = 79.4, 95% CI 78.5 to 80.5) at lead times of 1 to 3 months, albeit with larger uncertainty. For the period May to October 2020, the posterior median of the predictions made with the superensemble was also slightly more accurate (CRPS = 110, 95% CI 102 to 575) than the posterior median of the predictions made with the baseline model (CRPS = 125, 95% CI 120 to 168), albeit with larger uncertainty. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003542.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows an example of how this information could be portrayed to users.

              <p>This study details a probabilistic dengue early warning system based on a model superensemble, formulated using Earth observations and driven by seasonal climate forecasts. The system is able to generate accurate probabilistic forecasts of dengue metrics that have the potential for guiding policy- and decision-making processes in Vietnam. We make predictions for each of the 28 ensemble members of the seasonal climate forecast and generate 1,000 samples from the posterior distribution of the predicted number of cases.</p>
              <p>Deciding which predictive model is the best from a suite of competing models is not a straightforward task. Each model carries somewhat different information of the modelled processes. Here, we present a method for reconciling between-model disagreements while improving forecast accuracy. The combination of models into a superensemble helps offset individual model biases across time and space [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Superensembles were initially developed for climate modelling [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] and have gradually gained popularity in disease modelling (see, for example, [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]).</p>
              <p>Our novel dengue early warning system relies on probabilistic models to reflect forecast uncertainty and to explicitly assign probabilities to outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The system has been developed to aid policy- and decision-making processes in Vietnam with the guidance of key stakeholders in the Ministry of Health of Vietnam, WHO regional office, the Pasteur Institutes in Nha Trang and Ho Chi Minh, Province-level Ministries of Health, the Vietnamese NIHE, and the Tay Nguyen Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology. A range of stakeholder engagement workshops, face-to-face meetings with users, and surveys were conducted to tailor the system to the users’ needs. Our results demonstrate that the forecasts generated by our spatiotemporal superensemble have the potential to guide changes to the current practice in dengue control towards a more preventative approach allowing bespoke and targeted public health interventions and a more efficient allocation of scarce resources. Research on use of the system by stakeholders and its effect on changing dengue control practices is currently ongoing.</p>
              <p>We demonstrate that the superensemble slightly outperforms the predictive ability of the individual probabilistic models selected from a suite of top performing models at multiple lead times and months of the year in line with previous research [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Compared to a baseline model that predicts the same dengue incidence rate for each season and province, the superensemble generated more accurate predictions at lead times of 1 to 3 months but not beyond. Model performance was assessed using a range of verification metrics for probabilistic forecasts across time and space. To our knowledge, this is one of the first early warning systems informed by Earth observations to demonstrate predictive ability for prospective year-round dengue prediction in a robust out-of-sample framework. It is also one of the first prototypes for routine dengue early warning at multiple time leads.</p>
              <p>We found that the performance of the superensemble varied with geographic location, forecast horizon, and time of the year. The system showed ability in predicting spatiotemporal variations in dengue cases and outbreak occurrence at forecast horizons of up to 6 months ahead. Predictions deteriorated, and uncertainty increased with lead time, as previously observed in other settings and diseases [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Forecasts improved, and the credible intervals decreased as time progressed and dengue data increased, likely due to an improvement in the associations learned by the superensemble. Forecast errors increased for the onset and peak of the transmission season, possibly due to substantial interannual variation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003542.s007">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>
              <p>Relative to a baseline model, the superensemble made slightly more accurate predictions of the estimated number of dengue cases across most provinces, at lead times of 1 to 3 months in agreement with previous studies [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. At lead times beyond 3 months, however, the baseline model made more accurate predictions possibly because, as suggested by [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], incorporating seasonal climate data into predictive models may increase model complexity at the expense of lower out-of-sample predictive ability. Previous research has found that climate naïve models may outperform climate-informed models [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Those studies, however, used different sources of climate and environmental data than our study and were conducted in different settings (i.e., Thailand, Peru, and Puerto Rico) where the effects of climate might be significantly different to those observed in Vietnam. In addition, those studies initialised their prospective forecasts at fixed times of the year, whereas our study initialised forecasts at each calendar month, providing the model with more opportunities to learn the relationships between dengue incidence and each of the climatic and sociodemographic predictors.</p>
              <p>Outbreaks are difficult to predict, even more so at forecast horizons of several months ahead. Nevertheless, our superensemble demonstrated predictive ability for outbreak detection up to a lead time of 6 months, evaluated using proper scores over a suite of moving outbreak thresholds. One of the best performing outbreak thresholds was the endemic channel plus 2 standard deviations, computed using data from the previous 5 years. This method is currently in use across Vietnam [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], although with the difference of excluding outbreak years from the computation of the threshold. Following our results, however, we recommend the use of the 95th percentile as a threshold for outbreak detection as it gave slightly better results for detecting outbreaks. Recognising the limitations of the province-level data, it is encouraging that our predictions are accurate in most provinces up to 6 months in advance.</p>
              <p>In disease forecasting, each decision (e.g., to prevent or not to prevent an outbreak) has an associated cost that will lead to a benefit or a loss depending on the outcome. Decision-makers have the task of selecting the action that minimises potential losses. We used a simple analysis [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] to assess the relative value of the forecasts generated by the superensemble. Our figures are only illustrative. Still, they highlight that using a dengue early warning system has relative value compared to not using a forecast. The superensemble had considerable value across most provinces. However, in northern provinces, where dengue is essentially absent, the forecast is predicted to have limited relative value compared to always preparing for an outbreak or never preparing for it. The assessment of the relative value of the dengue early warning system may help stakeholders justify public investment in the development and generation of seasonal forecasts or to help raise awareness of their potential value.</p>
              <p>Although our proposed early warning system provides useful information for public health preparedness and response, it has some limitations worth mentioning. First, while our modelling framework incorporates important determinants of dengue occurrence such as climate and urbanisation, it does not explicitly incorporate, at this stage, the potential effects of other important determinants of disease such as the deployment of mosquito control interventions, vector indices, serotype-specific circulation, herd immunity, and the mobility of people and goods, all of which may lead to significant changes in the level of risk experienced locally [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Stakeholders in Vietnam have recently started collecting supporting data on vector indices and dengue virus serotypes. However, there is a lack of publicly available, continuous, and long-term data sets that could be used to inform modelling efforts. In this study, we account for some of the variation that might be attributed to these factors by using spatiotemporal random effects in each of the models included in the superensemble. Future developments of the system may incorporate some of these factors if data are made available. Second, the quality and consistency of the dengue data are affected by the limited confirmation of suspected cases through laboratory diagnostic test, leading to large uncertainties that are difficult to quantify. Third, our computations of dengue risk do not take into consideration uncertainties due to the potential under- or misreporting of dengue cases. Consequently, our model superensemble forecasts may underestimate the real number of cases occurring at any given time. Finally, our forecasts do not carry forward the uncertainty of the one-step-ahead forecasts used to simulate prospective lagged cases. Future developments may represent this uncertainty more accurately by using simulation-based path forecasts in a Bayesian framework [<xref rid="pmed.1003542.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>We have demonstrated that a superensemble of probabilistic dengue models, formulated using Earth observations and driven by seasonal climate forecasts and a reconstructed/prospective estimate of lagged dengue cases, is useful to generate probabilistic predictions of dengue risk across Vietnam at multiple lead times and months of the year. We acknowledge that there are alternative state-of-the-art approaches to dengue forecasting that may be equally as effective as the one presented here. However, our aim was to develop a system that outperformed previous practice in Vietnam where no forecasting system was used to guide decision-making processes. A theoretical analysis showed that compared to not using a forecasting system, the superensemble has relative value across most of the country, suggesting that it has potential for guiding decision-making processes. The dengue forecasting system presented here has been rolled out across Vietnam and could be tailored for other dengue-endemic countries. Further work may include investigating the feasibility of producing probabilistic forecasts with sufficient predictive ability at the district or commune levels and a comparison with other statistical and mechanistic approaches.</p>

              <p>Requests from the editors:</p>
              <p>*Please revise your title according to PLOS Medicine's style - this should summarise the study question but also state (preferably after colon in the subtitle) the study design (eg "A randomized controlled trial," "A retrospective study," "A modelling study," etc.).</p>
              <p>*In the last sentence of the Abstract Methods and Findings section, please add a brief summary of any key limitation(s) of the study's methodology.</p>
              <p>*At this stage, we ask that you include a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. This text is subject to editorial change and should be distinct from the scientific abstract. Please see our author guidelines for more information: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript#loc-author-summary">https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript#loc-author-summary</ext-link></p>
              <p>*Please clarify whether the analytical approach detailed here was laid out in a prospective protocol or analysis plan? Please state this (either way) early in the Methods section.</p>
              <p>a) If a prospective analysis plan (from your funding proposal, IRB or other ethics committee submission, study protocol, or other planning document written before analyzing the data) was used in designing the study, please include the relevant prospectively written document with your revised manuscript as a Supporting Information file to be published alongside your study, and cite it in the Methods section. A legend for this file should be included at the end of your manuscript. </p>
              <p>b) If no such document exists, please make sure that the Methods section transparently describes when analyses were planned, and when/why any data-driven changes to analyses took place. </p>
              <p>c) In either case, changes in the analysis-- including those made in response to peer review comments-- should be identified as such in the Methods section of the paper, with rationale.</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Dengue is a climate-sensitive disease, and many efforts have been attempted to predict future outbreak risk using environmental conditions and past patterns of dengue. However, it is relatively scarce to combine forecasts from multiple competing models into a superensemble to make more accurate predictions. This study aimed to develop a superensemble of probabilistic hierarchical dengue models to predict dengue risk up to six months ahead at the province level across Vietnam. It is an interesting and well-presented manuscript but several issues should be addressed to improve its clarity. </p>
              <p>How were suspected and confirmed dengue cases diagnosed and reported? More information on each category is clearly needed. The quality and consistency of the dengue data was likely to vary with area and time, and it remains largely unknown how this problem might affect the construction of the model. Data on both disease and environmental conditions (e.g. meteorological, demographic and land-cover variables) had different spatial resolutions and it is unclear how these datasets were matched. Is there any change in the administrative boundary across 63 provinces in Vietnam during the period 2002-2019? How were population weighted monthly averages calculated for each climate variable? Why were verification metrics inconsistent (e.g. CRPS, RMSE and MAE were small but DIC and WAIC were big in Table 1)? Several explanatory variables (e.g. minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and sea surface temperature anomalies) were likely to be highly correlated (L315-319), and how was this issue resolved? Combining all best performing models into a model superensemble led to a lower CRPS and MAE than any of the five competing models, but the RMSE was an exception as the RMSE of the superensemble was higher than two of the five models (L335-337). Why is it the case? Fig 8 shows a range of cost-loss ratios and outbreak thresholds for 42 Vietnamese provinces. How about other 21 provinces as Vietnam has 63 provinces? It is important to demonstrate that their spatio-temporal superensemble could guide changes to the current practice (L479-84). However, no results were presented on this aspect.</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: I have mixed feelings about this paper. On the one hand, the work is really quite impressive, with a diverse set of top-notch datasets and cutting-edge methods. I found myself nodding away enthusiastically as I read the methods section and text of the results. On the other hand, though, the actual results are not very good. The superensemble of forecasts gives effectively the same performance as the better models do individually, as can be seen from table 1 but more clearly from supplementary figure 2. The text therefore feels misleading: yes, the superensemble may be technically better but effectively it was the same and I would have wanted to have seen a more balanced description of that, because this is the sort of project that other countries should be copying and they need the right information to evaluate how complex to aim for. The other reason I say the results are not very good is that the forecast at six months is really poor. Figure S6 illustrates this clearly: in March, the authors are trying to forecast the situation in August, and for HCMC can't even tell if the number of cases will be a few hundred or 20 000. If there is this level of uncertainty, the more honest thing to do would be to report that the forecast accuracy is intolerable at that forecast window and instead limit the forecast to say one to two months into the future. I thought this paper was great until I went to the supplement and had the chance to see directly what the forecasts looked like: they are really not presented transparently within the ms itself.</p>
              <p>My second major concern is about the cost analysis, which is poorly handled and lowers the overall quality of the manuscript. I don't think the equation is correct (surely the optimal decision depends not just on the ratio of cost under action 1 and benefit under action 2 but also the impact of the two actions on the outcome and the costs of action 2 and benefits of action 1), and the statement about always or never preparing for outbreaks being the default raises alarm bells. The decision making process about interventions for outbreaks of dengue is waaaaaay more complex than the authors are making it out to be and the analysis here really comes across as the view from an ivory tower. If the authors really want to do a cost-benefit analysis, perhaps because the grant promised it, then it would behove them to do it properly. You have some really great people like Mark Jit at LSHTM, why not tap on them to see how to do a proper CBA? (Probably as a separate paper though.)</p>
              <p>My final major criticism is on the structure of the forecast model/s themselves. Why are no lags considered for the predictors? Some such as El Nino would expect to see their presence felt a long time after. Even local features could plausibly have an impact longer than one month in the future because of the long latency caused by the cycles of breeding, infection and both incubation periods. You should be able to quickly refute this. Furthermore, why are the data at such a crude temporal resolution? If the VN MOH has provided an author, can s/he not provide weekly (or even daily! That would be fab!) data, because that would presumably greatly improve the predictive potential.</p>
              <p>A few minor comments that may help revise the manuscript:</p>
              <p>Abstract: "the skill of a system using different lead times in a year-round prediction system has not been previously explored" I'm not sure that is strictly true. For instance, Singapore has been doing something like this for a number of years </p>
              <p>L13: \\textit{Ae.~aegypti} to prevent inter-sentence spacing. You can similarly use this trick after i.e.~ and so on</p>
              <p>L10: International standard is to use a space to demarcate thousands from hundreds to avoid ambiguity about decimal point vs decimal comma </p>
              <p>L24-32: A bit of repetitive sentence structuring, consider tweaking.</p>
              <p>L39-48: These sentences were a bit hard to read. Consider tweaking with some extra words at the start of the sentences like "It is also known that", "In contrast," or changing the pattern a bit like "Biting rates are also affected by xxx" etc, to help with the flow</p>
              <p>L42: bad latex: $&gt;$ instead of &gt; and either \\degree, \\textdegree (depending on packages) or $^{\\circ}$</p>
              <p>L71: What is fundamentally wrong with testing a model on year 2015 after training it on 2016 (say)? Does it not still give a valid approximation of out of sample performance?</p>
              <p>L81: Good point, perhaps worth elaborating on the difficulties of implementing such a system not in a research environment</p>
              <p>L102: $&lt;$ not &lt;</p>
              <p>L129: Possible to show time series of the data for a few provinces?</p>
              <p>L142: Perhaps my physics is letting me down but isn't kg kg^{-1} unitless?</p>
              <p>L152-160: Do I read correctly that you used two different datasets to create population data? How were these harmonised? If not, please clarify and remedy my confusion!</p>
              <p>Eqn1: Should Y be Y_{i,t-1}? Should the sum be enclosed in parenthesis to prevent ambiguity about the random effects? What happens when Y=0?</p>
              <p>L205: missing closing parenthesis</p>
              <p>Eqn 5: \\exp \\max</p>
              <p>T1: Interesting that so little benefit accrues from the superensemble compared to simpler models. The text hints that the superensemble is substantially better</p>
              <p>L367: Some of this subsection should perhaps go in the methods section?</p>
              <p>L407/8: missing spaces</p>
              <p>L416: The proposed decision support tool is… a bit weak, isn't it? Aesthetically it's ugly, but the uncertainty in the predictions seemingly makes the forecast useless. </p>
              <p>T2: Why is Moderate defined as being up to the 75th percentile AND mean+1SD? Mean+1SD should not be the 75th percentile.</p>
              <p>L515: What is 95 per cent percentile? Is it the same as the 95th percentile?</p>
              <p>F1: Not very informative. Can I propose you omit the islands (and just add a comment in the legend that islands in the East Sea are omitted for space). Then you can stack the maps in a 6x2 arrangement, making them all bigger and reducing the white space between them. At present you can hardly make out the changes in colour around HCMC and Vinh.</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: # Overview</p>
              <p>In this manuscript the authors present and evaluate ensemble forecasts of</p>
              <p>monthly dengue case numbers in each province of Vietnam for 2002-2019, which</p>
              <p>incorporate a variety of demographic, land-cover, and climate data. These</p>
              <p>forecasts are evaluated for lead times of 1-6 months --- looking much further</p>
              <p>ahead than many existing dengue forecasting studies. The evaluation includes a</p>
              <p>cost-loss analysis of whether action taken in response to the projected outbreak</p>
              <p>probability would be beneficial. I found this to be an interesting and</p>
              <p>well-designed study, and the prospect of further evaluation of this forecasting</p>
              <p>system is exciting.</p>
              <p># Major comments</p>
              <p>1. Regarding the "Modelling approach" section on page 6, I understand that</p>
              <p> there were 7 seasonal climate data sets (mean monthly values were used):</p>
              <p> (a) Minimum temperature;</p>
              <p> (b) Maximum temperature;</p>
              <p> (c) Daily precipitation;</p>
              <p> (d) Specific humidity;</p>
              <p> (e) Diurnal temperature range;</p>
              <p> (f) Wind speed; and</p>
              <p> (g) Sea surface temperature anomalies for the Niño 3.4 Region.</p>
              <p> So 128 different models were considered to cover all possible combinations of</p>
              <p> these 7 data sets. But this only became apparent after reading the first few</p>
              <p> sentences of the results section, where this is explained to the reader. I</p>
              <p> would have found it quite helpful to instead include these remarks in the</p>
              <p> "Modelling approach" section.</p>
              <p>2. "Model selection" section (page 6): "The testing set comprised the climate</p>
              <p> hindcast data for the six months immediately after the last observation in</p>
              <p> the training set for each geographical area."</p>
              <p> I apologize if I've missed an obvious point here, but why were hindcasts used</p>
              <p> instead of actual data for this period? Is the intent that in an operational</p>
              <p> system they would be replaced by climate forecasts from the same source</p>
              <p> (Copernicus Climate Data Store)?</p>
              <p>3. "Accounting for autocorrelation in disease transmission" section (page 7):</p>
              <p> "To generate dengue forecasts one month ahead, log(Y_i, t−1) for time t + 1</p>
              <p> corresponds to the logarithm of the number of dengue cases at time t. To</p>
              <p> generate the forecasts two months ahead we first fitted a climate naïve model</p>
              <p> ..."</p>
              <p> It isn't clear to my why a climate-naive model was used here. Since the</p>
              <p> testing set included climate hindcast data for the six months after the last</p>
              <p> observation (see previous comment) then why couldn't the climate-informed</p>
              <p> model be used to predict the number of dengue cases for time t + 1? And at</p>
              <p> the start of the Results section (page 9), the authors write:</p>
              <p> "Predictions up to six months ahead were made at each time step starting in</p>
              <p> January 2007 using seasonal climate hindcasts (retrospective forecasts) data</p>
              <p> ..."</p>
              <p>4. "Model superensemble" section (page 8): "A new set of superensemble weights</p>
              <p> were computed each time a forecast was issued using training data from all</p>
              <p> previous years."</p>
              <p> Can the authors comment on how these weights evolved over time? Was the same</p>
              <p> model consistently the highest-weighted over all of the forecast months?</p>
              <p> Presumably in an operation system it would be highly desirable if the model</p>
              <p> weights were stable from one month to the next? I suppose this could be</p>
              <p> extended to allowing seasonal variation (i.e., month-to-month) if different</p>
              <p> models are understood to perform best in different calendar months. It would</p>
              <p> be great to see, e.g., a supplementary figure that shows how the weights</p>
              <p> evolved.</p>
              <p>4. "Model superensemble" section (page 8): "In addition, we evaluated the skill</p>
              <p> of the obtained forecasts using the continuous rank probability skill score</p>

              <p> It appears that there should be further text after equation (6), since it</p>

              <p> text, or should the comma be removed?</p>
              <p>5. Results section (page 9): how did the authors decide to include precisely 5</p>
              <p> models in the superensemble? Was there a clear divide in performance between</p>
              <p> the top 5 models and the remaining 123 models? And were the authors surprised</p>
              <p> that none of the models in the superensemble included daily precipitation as</p>
              <p> a seasonal climate predictor?</p>

              <p> Did the authors consider evaluating the models using any relative error</p>
              <p> measures, in addition to the chosen absolute error measures? This is an</p>
              <p> important consideration for infectious diseases epidemic forecasts since an</p>
              <p> error of, say, 10 cases has very different significance when the expected</p>
              <p> number is 20 cases or 20,000 cases. As the authors note:</p>
              <p> "From August to November the skill is reduced for selected provinces in the</p>
              <p> central and southern regions characterized by larger dengue incidence</p>
              <p> variability."</p>
              <p> This might be primarily influenced by the choice of absolute error measures</p>
              <p> rather than being intrinsic to the models themselves.</p>

              <p> the spatiotemporal dynamics of dengue fever with reasonable skill although</p>
              <p> predictions tend to underestimate the number of cases particularly during</p>

              <p> This observation made me wonder whether the model fitting may not have</p>

              <p> The authors note (top of page 6) that models were fitted "using a negative</p>

              <p> and that "penalising complexity priors were assumed for [...] the dispersion</p>
              <p> parameters".</p>
              <p> What prior distribution was used for the over-dispersion parameters, and what</p>
              <p> were the posterior distributions when the models were fitted? I couldn't see</p>
              <p> this mentioned in the manuscript text, nor am I able to identify a location</p>
              <p> in the provided code or supplementary materials where this is defined. In the</p>
              <p> provided file "04_Fit_models.R" there is the following code:</p>

              <p>Reviewer #4: </p>
              <p>This is an interesting paper on an important subject, the development of early warning systems for vector-borne diseases, focusing here on dengue in Vietnam. While the general approach appears reasonable there are a number of clarifications and amendments required. Specific comments are given below.</p>
              <p>The model predictions presented by the authors seem useful but they are currently somewhat of a black box. In particular, there are two directions for improving the presentation of the results. The first is based upon standard prequential theory of proper scoring rules and the paper would improve if the authors would decompose the overall prediction error for the different scoring rules into calibration and sharpness, the predictive measures corresponding to bias and variance </p>
              <p>In addition, it would be very useful for this work, as well as future developments, to see the individual contribution to the predictive ability of the different components. For example, are the climate forecasts adding substantially to the predictive ability or the earth observation data correspond to the best part of the ensemble's predictive power?</p>
              <p>Also, how accurate climate forecasts are the predictors of seasonal climate, i.e. how good are these forecasts on their own right?</p>
              <p>This will be illuminating and could also guide the authors' future efforts in improving this work. It will also shed some light upon the paper's drawbacks, since absence of disease control and related data appears rather important, at least a-priori.</p>
              <p>In addition, it will lead to a discussion on issues of model mis-specification, since moderate predictive ability of a covariate (like seasonal climate) but reasonable prediction of a function thereof (such as disease incidence) suggests issues of potential model mis-specification.</p>
              <p>A vital aspect of this work is the predictive ability of this approach and the authors claim that this is superior to the competition. However, as far as can be seen in this paper, the comparison is not made with a number of state-of-the-art alternatives, but with a baseline model which is a sub-case of the model class used in the paper. </p>
              <p>Is that an accurate description? </p>
              <p>If so, are the model's conclusions a fair representation of the paper's findings?</p>
              <p>This should be clarified and amended as appropriate.</p>
              <p>An important clarification should be made with respect to terminology. </p>
              <p>Is model superensemble an alternative name for bayesian model averaging (BMA)?</p>
              <p>If so this should be clarified.</p>
              <p>Incidentally, BMA essentially started in the fifties with the work of Savage, Lindley and Good so appropriate referencing could be added. </p>
              <p>Non-Bayesian (e.g. AIC-based) model weights are also commonly used, including in ecology where the Burnham and Anderson's 2002 book on multimodel inference is highly influential.</p>
              <p>In relation to the above comment, please clarify the definition of the ML weights used in equation 5. The DIC weights are often used as a Bayesian equivalent of the AIC-based ones. However, the most commonly used weights are BIC-based, essentially since they agree asymptotically with standard Bayesian theory. However, ML weights are non-standard and the authors will need to specify how are they calculated and give a reference to their theoretical justification.</p>
              <p>The model class that this work is based upon seems reasonable. However, some details need to be added, including the specific parameterisation of the negative binomial distribution and the definition of mu (is it the mean of the log data?)</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Reviewer #5: The manuscript presents a Bayesian spatio-temporal model for Dengue</p>
              <p>counts, which incorporates weather and land-cover variables. The five</p>
              <p>subsets of covariates that produced the best one-to-six-months forecasts</p>
              <p>during the period 2007-2016 were combined via Bayesian model averaging.</p>
              <p>This superensemble outperformed the ensemble members in terms of both CRPS</p>
              <p>and point forecasts (RMSE, MAE). It was eventually used to generate</p>
              <p>probabilistic forecasts for the 6 months ahead of April 2020.</p>
              <p>Cooperation with key stakeholders from from public health institutions</p>
              <p>strengthens the paper and supports transferring scientific progress into</p>
              <p>practice.</p>
              <p>The paper is well written overall, but I have several questions and remarks</p>
              <p>about details of the model and how forecasts are generated.</p>
              <p>Major comments</p>
              <p>--------------</p>
              <p>1. An AR1 prior is used for \\delta_{i,m[t]}. Shouldn't the model assume</p>
              <p> a cyclic effect, i.e., have January conditioned on December?</p>
              <p>2. Eq (1): What is the motivation behind scaling past counts by the</p>
              <p> population, i.e., having the terms (1-\\rho) log(P) + \\rho log(Y)?</p>
              <p> I think I haven't seen this in related models before. Did explorative</p>
              <p> analyses indicate a better fit when incorporating past incidence</p>
              <p> instead of past counts?</p>
              <p>3. Related to 2.: The model fit and forecasts could probably be improved</p>
              <p> by allowing for a region-specific effect of log(Y_{i,t-1}), i.e.,</p>
              <p> region-specific force of infection \\rho_i. Scaling by the population</p>
              <p> would no longer be necessary and the model would more adequately</p>
              <p> capture regional variation in unobserved important determinants of</p>
              <p> disease spread. A recent example of a related model with</p>
              <p> region-specific force of infection is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8390">https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8390</ext-link> .</p>
              <p>4. I was really confused by how k-step-ahead (k&gt;1) forecasts are generated.</p>
              <p> The manuscript intends to provide superensemble forecasts of regional</p>
              <p> dengue incidence up to 6 months ahead *using seasonal climate forecasts*,</p>
              <p> but then a *climate naive* model is used to generate forecasts for t+2</p>
              <p> to t+6? Why make the (impressive!) effort of collecting climate data and</p>
              <p> forecasts if they are not used to inform probabilistic forecasts?</p>
              <p> Furthermore, how is the forecast distribution generated? Are these</p>
              <p> simple negative binomial forecasts conditioning on the *point*</p>
              <p> forecast for y_{t+1}, ignoring the uncertainty in that forecast? I'm not sure</p>
              <p> if this counts as "properly reflect forecast uncertainty" (discussion).</p>
              <p> Maybe simulation-based path forecasts should be used instead?</p>
              <p>5. Eq (3): I think it may be useful to note that the baseline model isn't</p>
              <p> such a simple model after all. The province-specific and time-varying</p>
              <p> random effects will compensate for much of the missing X variables. I</p>
              <p> think a more important "feature" of the baseline model is the missing</p>
              <p> autoregressive term. This omission should also be kept in mind when</p>
              <p> discussing performance relative to this model around p. 15, l. 504. I</p>
              <p> would expect a non-dynamic model to perform particularly well in</p>
              <p> regions with only sporadic dengue cases. Please also report</p>
              <p> the performance of the baseline model in Table 1.</p>
              <p>6. One model should really be added to prove the usefulness of the</p>
              <p> superensemble for forecasting: Does the superensemble outperform a model</p>
              <p> which contains all of the covariates of models 1 to 5 combined? If so I'm</p>
              <p> willing to believe that "we demonstrate that using a model superensemble</p>
              <p> results in better forecasts than using individual models" (discussion).</p>
              <p>7. Can we conclude from Figure 1 that it would make sense to include a</p>
              <p> non-dynamic baseline model in the ensemble? As Reich et al (2019) put</p>
              <p> it: "building ensemble models that capitalize on the strengths of a</p>
              <p> diverse set of individual component models will be critical to</p>
              <p> improving accuracy and consistency of models in all infectious disease</p>
              <p> forecasting settings." (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1812594116">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1812594116</ext-link>)</p>
              <p>8. Table 1: Please report which lags have been selected for the climate</p>
              <p> predictors in the different models. I think this could be an</p>
              <p> interesting result by itself.</p>
              <p>9. The ROC analysis was primarily used to compare AUC values across different</p>
              <p> forecast horizons (Figure 5), which is not very interesting. It seems more</p>
              <p> relevant to compare how well the superensemble can forecast the four</p>
              <p> different outbreak indicators (there does not seem to be much difference but</p>
              <p> it is difficult to compare across plots). The text also says that an optimal</p>
              <p> cut-off value for the probability is defined to maximize sensitivity and</p>
              <p> specificity (which is no clear criterion since you cannot maximize both), but</p>
              <p> I cannot find the resulting cut-offs.</p>
              <p>Minor comments</p>
              <p>--------------</p>
              <p>1. Strong underreporting:</p>
              <p> * Intro (first two paragraphs): The question arises why there is such</p>
              <p> strong underreporting. Does dengue seldom require treatment? The intro</p>
              <p> should probably mention common symptoms of dengue infection.</p>
              <p> * At the end, the discussion briefly mentions that the model only</p>
              <p> considers *reported* disease incidence. Thus, routine forecasting</p>
              <p> relies on stable reporting rates. If there were efforts to reduce</p>
              <p> underreporting at some point, endemic channels or quantiles based on</p>
              <p> historical incidence wouldn't make sense any more. Are there any such</p>
              <p> efforts in Vietnam? How could forecasts integrate such a (gradual)</p>
              <p> change?</p>
              <p>2. p. 3, l. 82: "deterministic models" are mixed up with "point forecasts"</p>
              <p> here. ARIMA or Poisson regression used in the referenced papers are</p>
              <p> *not* deterministic. The point is that you would like to quantify</p>
              <p> the uncertainty of your forecasts in addition to your best (point)</p>
              <p> estimate of future disease spread.</p>
              <p>3. p. 4, l. 102: This sounds like CUSUM methods should be considered,</p>
              <p> see e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.05.017">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.05.017</ext-link> .</p>
              <p>4. Materials and methods should also say where the shapefiles originate.</p>
              <p>5. Ref 59 for the Worldpop project contains a wrong URL.</p>
              <p>6. Why are two different population datasets [refs 59 and 60] used for P</p>
              <p> in the model and to weight monthly averages of climate variables,</p>
              <p> respectively?</p>
              <p>7. p. 5, l. 161: land-cover variables are per province _and per year_</p>
              <p> (please clarify this). I thought they were time-constant until I read</p>
              <p> they vary annually later in the text.</p>
              <p>8. p. 5, l. 175: There seem to be two data sources here; where did the</p>
              <p> data eventually come from? Furthermore, the training period ranged from</p>
              <p> 2002 to 2006, the testing period from 2007 to 2016, and the forecasting</p>
              <p> period from April 2020 to September 2020. How does hindcast data for</p>
              <p> only 2012-2016 fit in here?</p>
              <p>9. p. 6, l. 182: I'd prefer to see "month t = 1, ..., T" instead of the</p>
              <p> more general "time t" to clarify the temporal resolution of the model.</p>
              <p>10. On Eq (1): Please specify the distribution assumed for the temporal</p>
              <p> random effects, probably Gaussian.</p>

              <p> counts, so \\rho is not an autoregressive *coefficient* in the usual</p>
              <p> sense: there is a multiplicative effect (Y_{i,t-1}/P_{i,t-1})^\\rho on</p>
              <p> the mean. Maybe the more general term "autoregressive parameter"</p>

              <p>12. p. 6, l. 215: I don't understand why annual variation is a reason for</p>
              <p> the land-cover variables to be excluded from the selection procedure.</p>

              <p>14. p. 7, l. 230: "the best two performing models for each verification</p>
              <p> metric" doesn't seem correct. The results show only 5 models, so it</p>
              <p> seems only the top model for each verification metric has been</p>
              <p> selected. But then in Table 1, model 2 seems to be best for both RMSE</p>
              <p> and MAE, so how obtain five component models? Please clarify the</p>
              <p> selection procedure.</p>
              <p>15. Eq (4) and (5): It seems there is some confusion with indices i and k.</p>
              <p> For example, M_k in (4) should be M_i. Furthermore, why is w_i a</p>
              <p> vector and how does it sum to 1 given (5)? The "ML or DIC" part isn't</p>
              <p> quiet clear.</p>
              <p>16. Eq (6): CRPS_f and CRPS_b are undefined.</p>
              <p>17. p. 9, l. 314-330: This description is repetitive and should be</p>
              <p> dropped. The results section should concentrate on results, not</p>
              <p> methods.</p>
              <p>18. Figure 7: Shouldn't this be based on the 95% instead of the 75% quantile</p>
              <p> since the former had better scores?</p>

              <p>Requests from the editors:</p>
              <p>1. Please address the reviewer’s additional comments below on the description of your methodology.</p>
              <p>2. Please include line numbers in the margin throughout your text, including the abstract and author summary.</p>
              <p>3. Abstract: Please include some summary quantitative data on the fit of your model to prior data and on your future predictions (with 95% CIs and p values, as appropriate).</p>
              <p>---</p>
              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for addressing my previous comments. It's a nice article, well done.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: The authors have revised their paper and this now represents a substantially improved manuscript, acceptable for publication</p>
              <p>Reviewer #5: My main concern remains how k-step ahead forecasts are generated. Since forecasting is the main purpose of this manuscript, I think the corresponding description should be improved.</p>
              <p>I admit that I didn't have the time to look at the revised version in every detail. Nevertheless, I stumbled over a few issues in the authors' reply, which I would like to bring up for consideration.</p>
              <p>1. Eq 3+4: The math notation is too sloppy for a Bayesian inference approach. I've preferred the previous simplistic textual description of assuming a NegBin for Y_it. Now a random variable $Y$ (without $_{i,t}$) is introduced, whose meaning is undefined, and appending y &gt;= 0 doesn't make any sense. This Bayesian model should be either formulated with mathematical rigour, or with just the core part, i.e., Eq. 4, i.e., the conditional mean of $Y_{i,t}$.</p>
              <p>2. Eq. 3 would imply that this paper assumes a marginal NegBin for $Y_{i,t}$, but my previous reading suggests that a conditional NegBin was assumed, in particular also conditioning on the past observations just like for other covariates. Please clarify.</p>
              <p>3. Eq. 4 now says that $\\rho$ works on past counts not past incidence. However, the text below still contains Y/P. Please check.</p>
              <p>4. The reply confirms that k-step-ahead (k&gt;1) forecasts as implemented here do not carry forward the uncertainty of one-step-ahead forecasts. My interpretation is that the authors eventually assume a NegBin distribution for their forecast $Y_{t+2} | Y_t, ...$, by *imputing* a point prediction for $Y_{t+1}$ to actually compute $Y_{t+2} | Y_{t+1}, ...$. AFAIK, $Y_{t+2} | Y_t$ follows a *mixture* of NegBin distributions (which is not necessarily NegBin), see, e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2020.07.002">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2020.07.002</ext-link> (Section 3.4) for a correct approach. I understand that it is too late to fix this, but it would still be possible to include a cautious comment that all forecasts (including for k &gt; 1) assume a conditional NegBin distribution, imputing one-step-ahead point predictions for lagged counts. I don't know if there is a name for such "naive" forecasts.</p>
              <p>5. Table 1 should use two digits in the Bias column.</p>
              <p>6. A "ROC curve" analysis would be used to choose a diagnostic threshold and display its effect on TPR and FPR and to display the overall diagnostic accuracy as the area under the ROC curve. I'm thus puzzled by the use of the term "ROC curve" analysis in the manuscript.</p>

              <p>We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement. If any of the co-authors have not filled in the statement, we will remind them to do so when the paper is revised. If all statements are not completed in a timely fashion this could hold up the re-review process. Should there be a problem getting one of your co-authors to fill in a statement we will be in contact. YOU MUST NOT ADD OR REMOVE AUTHORS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALERTED THE EDITOR HANDLING THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE CHANGE AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HAVE AGREED TO IT.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that the paper adheres to the PLOS Data Availability Policy (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>), which requires that all data underlying the study's findings be provided in a repository or as Supporting Information. For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it.</p>
              <p>Please note, when your manuscript is accepted, an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you've already opted out via the online submission form. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online or are unsure if you have already indicated as such, please let the journal staff know immediately at <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.</p>
              <p>If you have any questions in the meantime, please contact me or the journal staff on <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.  </p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving the revised manuscript by Jan 19 2021 11:59PM.   </p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>

              <p>Requests from Editors:</p>
              <p>1. Data Availability Statement (DAS): Note that a study author cannot be the contact person for a dataset. Please provide alternative details for your dengue data.</p>
              <p>2. Abstract: Please ensure that all quantitative data are also presented in the main Results section, and that the values match.</p>
              <p>3. Throughout, please perhaps replace “skill” with a more appropriate term (eg. ‘strength’), when describing the performance of the forecast system.</p>
              <p>4. In the introduction, please mention dengue vaccination - although a complex and not very satisfactory situation, this could be discussed.</p>
              <p>5. Please mention in your Methods that your study did not require separate ethical approval.</p>
              <p>6. Line 749: "explicitly incorporate".</p>
              <p>7. Please provide a URL or DOI for reference 6.</p>
              <p>8. RE reference 91 listed as ”in press”, papers cannot be listed in the reference list until they have been accepted for publication or are otherwise publicly accessible (for example, in a preprint archive). The information may be cited in the text as a personal communication with the author if the author provides written permission to be named. Alternatively, please provide a different appropriate reference. </p>
              <p>Comments from Reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #5: Thank you for addressing my previous comments, especially for clarifying k-step-ahead as imputed one-step-ahead forecasts and including cautious comments about that.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, this manuscript is now ready for publication. Congratulations!</p>

              <p>Dear Dr Colón-González, </p>
              <p>On behalf of my colleagues and the guest Academic Editor, Alex R. Cook, I am pleased to inform you that we have agreed to publish your manuscript "Probabilistic seasonal dengue forecasting in Vietnam: A modelling study using superensembles" (PMEDICINE-D-20-02989R4) in PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. Please be aware that it may take several days for you to receive this email; during this time no action is required by you. Once you have received these formatting requests, please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, please log into Editorial Manager at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/">http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/</ext-link>, click the "Update My Information" link at the top of the page, and update your user information to ensure an efficient production process. </p>
