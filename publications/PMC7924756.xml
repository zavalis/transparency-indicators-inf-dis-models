              <abstract>
                <p>Murine typhus is a flea-borne zoonotic disease that has been recently reported on Reunion Island, an oceanic volcanic island located in the Indian Ocean. Five years of survey implemented by the regional public health services have highlighted a strong temporal and spatial structure of the disease in humans, with cases mainly reported during the humid season and restricted to the dry southern and western portions of the island. We explored the environmental component of this zoonosis in an attempt to decipher the drivers of disease transmission. To do so, we used data from a previously published study (599 small mammals and 175 <italic>Xenopsylla</italic> fleas from 29 sampling sites) in order to model the spatial distribution of rat fleas throughout the island. In addition, we carried out a longitudinal sampling of rats and their ectoparasites over a 12 months period in six study sites (564 rats and 496 <italic>Xenopsylla</italic> fleas) in order to model the temporal dynamics of flea infestation of rats. Generalized Linear Models and Support Vector Machine classifiers were developed to model the <italic>Xenopsylla</italic> Genus Flea Index (GFI) from climatic and environmental variables. Results showed that the spatial distribution and the temporal dynamics of fleas, estimated through the GFI variations, are both strongly controlled by abiotic factors: rainfall, temperature and land cover. The models allowed linking flea abundance trends with murine typhus incidence rates. Flea infestation in rats peaked at the end of the dry season, corresponding to hot and dry conditions, before dropping sharply. This peak of maximal flea abundance preceded the annual peak of human murine typhus cases by a few weeks. Altogether, presented data raise novel questions regarding the ecology of rat fleas while developed models contribute to the design of control measures adapted to each micro region of the island with the aim of lowering the incidence of flea-borne diseases.</p>

                <p>Murine typhus is a neglected zoonotic disease, as the number of human cases is likely underestimated in the absence of specific symptoms. It is caused by <italic>Rickettsia typhi</italic>, a pathogenic bacterium transmitted by rat fleas (<italic>Xenospylla</italic> spp). The distribution and dynamics of this disease result from complex interactions involving vectors, reservoirs and humans within a shared environment. In this study, we explored the environmental drivers of rat fleas’ abundance on Reunion Island, where murine typhus has recently emerged. Results showed that <italic>i)</italic> rat fleas’ abundance is highly dynamic, characterized by a peak at the end of the dry season and <italic>ii)</italic> among the factors investigated, rainfall, temperature and land cover are the main determinants of rat fleas’ abundance. We modeled a predictive map of flea distribution that strongly correlates with the spatial distribution of human cases on the island. This study highlights the importance of accounting for environmental and climatic characteristics to better understand the spatial and temporal drivers of flea-borne diseases.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Zoonotic pathogens are defined as infectious agents transmitted among vertebrate animals and humans [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In a number of zoonoses of major medical concern, humans are only incident hosts unable to maintain persistent secondary transmission of the pathogens and hence playing an anecdotal role in the evolution and biological cycles of these microorganisms. For such diseases, investigations aiming at deciphering environmental transmission cycles are crucial to determine conditions favoring spillover transmission from animal to human populations. The first step of such investigations relies on the identification of animal reservoirs. Subsequently, it is paramount to thoroughly describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of zoonotic pathogens <italic>in natura</italic> and the biotic or abiotic factors controlling these dynamics. Such a comprehensive knowledge is likely to significantly improve the understanding of the ecology of a given zoonotic pathogen, which in turn will orientate the design of control measures towards enhanced effectiveness.</p>
              <p>Spatiotemporal dynamics of transmission can be characterized at different scales, from global, regional to local scales. Implementing high throughput surveillance systems able to detect above normal incidence of zoonoses at a global scale allows pinpointing emergence episodes and implementing early diagnosis. However, the ecology of a given pathogen is likely tightly associated to its niche, and identifying the drivers of the maintenance and emergence of a zoonotic disease requires the description of fine spatiotemporal dynamics of the disease within its discrete environmental setup.</p>
              <p>Such investigations are obviously challenging given the number of animal species potentially acting as reservoirs or vectors, and are further made more complex by migrating taxa. Insular ecosystems, and especially remote oceanic islands of limited size, are ideal settings for such investigations due to a limited biodiversity as well as reduced migration [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Reunion Island, a geographically isolated volcanic island located 700 km East of Madagascar has experienced in the last decade the emergence of several vector borne diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], including murine typhus, caused by the bacterium <italic>Rickettsia typhi</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The detection of the emergence of this disease in the island may have been delayed due to suboptimal surveillance and diagnosis prior the identification of the first human cases in 2012 [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Indeed, non-specific symptoms as well as low prevalence keep diseases such as murine typhus under-reported from even sophisticated surveillance systems [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite a low incidence (in average, 8.8 cases have been detected each year between 2011 and 2019), the epidemiology of murine typhus on Reunion Island displays some interesting patterns: a strong geographic structure, cases being mostly restricted to the western and southern dry portions of the island [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; and a strong seasonality with cases peaking during the warm rainy season, between December and February [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>Rats are considered a major reservoir of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>typhi</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These rodents are widespread throughout the island as is typical on tropical islands [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that their distribution does not play a significant role in the geographic structure of the disease. By contrast, such structure may be driven by the distribution of fleas (hypothesis H1), which can be verified by gathering flea infestation indices of rats trapped in distinct habitats of the island. This hypothesis is indeed substantiated by a previous study reporting that rat fleas are virtually absent from the eastern humid windward coast while they are abundant in the dry savannah of the western coast [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As far as temporal dynamics are concerned, the seasonality of murine typhus may result from marked variations in either the abundance of fleas (H2) or <italic>R</italic>. <italic>typhi</italic> infection prevalence in fleas (H3) throughout the year, or from transient increases in human exposure to rats (H4), as documented in Madagascar where plague seasonality is associated with rats’ movements from the field to the villages, likely directed by the availability of food [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>The identification of the environmental drivers of the strong geographic structure and seasonality of murine typhus in Reunion Island is the focus of the present investigation. We tested two of the four previously stated hypotheses by using sampling data collected in distinct habitats and throughout all seasons. We developed a predictive map of flea distribution and tested whether the geographical structure of flea distribution and human cases are congruent (H1). In addition, we conducted a temporal investigation of rats’ infestation by fleas in order to test whether the seasonality of human disease results from seasonality in flea abundance (H2). Finally, we used gathered data and resulting conclusions to propose the implementation of simple control measures aimed at lowering murine typhus incidence on the island.</p>

                <p>Reunion Island is a small, densely populated island (2,512 km<sup>2</sup>, 866,506 inhabitants in 2019) located in the southwestern Indian Ocean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009029.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The climate is subtropical with two main seasons: a dry and mild season from May to October, and a rainy and hot season from November to April. This latter season is under the influence of tropical lows (including cyclones) associated with heavy rainfalls. Because of the mountainous and rugged relief, the climate is highly contrasted: the east windward coast is notoriously humid while the west leeward coast is distinctly drier. Of note, temperatures decrease progressively from the coast to the central mountains, with marked differences due to the elevations of mountainous central landscapes (&gt;3,000 meters).</p>

                <title>Modelling the spatial distribution of rat fleas</title>

Therefore, we defined the Genus Flea Index (GFI) as the total number of collected fleas belonging to the genus <italic>Xenopsylla</italic> divided by the total number of trapped mammals. GFI, representing the mean number of <italic>Xenopsylla</italic> spp. fleas sampled per trapped mammal, was calculated for each trapping site of Dataset 1 (n = 29) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0009029.s002">S2 Table</xref>).</p>
                <p>GFI was analyzed in relationship to ecological and climatic variables using uni-variable and multi-variable generalized linear modelling to investigate the spatial association between the GFI (variable to explain) and the following explanatory variables: annual minimum, maximum and mean temperature, annual median rainfall, percentage of different land cover types (agriculture, continuous urban, discontinuous urban, forest, shrub vegetation, herbaceous vegetation, barren land, water) in a 200-meters radius buffer. This distance corresponds to the maximum trip length for rats estimated in two tropical islands of southwestern Indian Ocean using mark-recapture sessions [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The explanatory variables were calculated for each trapping site of Dataset1 using Geographic Information System spatial analysis functions (ESRI ArcGIS Spatial Analyst).</p>
                <p>Poisson distribution function was used to fit the models, as it is appropriate for the analysis of count data. All variables were first tested in univariate analysis, and significant variables at a 0.05 <italic>p-</italic>value were selected. To reduce multicollinearity in the statistical model, pair-wise correlations between significant explanatory variables were assessed. Within a group of correlated variables (pairwise correlation coefficients greater than 0.7 or less than -0.7), only the most strongly associated variable (based on the likelihood ratio test) was further used for multivariate modelling. The final multivariate model was developed by backward elimination regression modelling. It was used to predict values of GFI for the entire island by applying the model to the climatic and environmental datasets using GIS (ESRI ArcGIS Spatial Analyst). Predicted GFI values were extracted at the location of each trapping site of Dataset1 and Dataset2, for comparison with observed GFI values using the root mean square error (RMSE).</p>

                <title>Modelling the temporal dynamics of rat fleas</title>
                <p>Data from a longitudinal trapping survey (Dataset2) were used to model the temporal dynamics of rat fleas. GFI was calculated for each trapping site of Dataset 2 (n = 6) and each date of trapping from March 2017 to February 2018 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009029.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0009029.s003">S3 Table</xref>). For the sites with annual average GFI greater than one (Pierrefond and Bois d’Olive), the temporal dynamics of GFI in relationship to meteorological variables was modelled using Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised learning technique. The following variables were calculated with a retroactive period (last <italic>N</italic> days) starting at the capture date: minimum, maximum and average temperatures, rain accumulation and maximum rainfall (<italic>N</italic> ∈ [0, 7, 14, 21, … 63]). The SVM method allowed accounting for non-linear relationships to separate high from low GFI values from a combination of at most three input meteorological variables to avoid overfitting. It was used with a radial kernel, a cost coefficient set to 1 and the epsilon parameter set to 1. All of the statistical calculations were performed in R language [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] using the package “e1071” [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

              <p>Understanding and predicting the transmission dynamics of vector-borne pathogens such as <italic>R</italic>. <italic>typhi</italic> is challenging as such dynamics result from complex interactions involving vectors, reservoirs and humans within a shared environment. In Reunion Island, non-specific symptoms of murine typhus associated with a recent emergence of the disease and a lack of awareness of family doctors are expected to lead to an underestimation of the number of cases, which makes it difficult to study disease risk factors using only statistical analyses of the human cases. In the present study, we analyzed factors related to rodents and rodent fleas compartments, both key components of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>typhi</italic> maintenance and transmission. The results of our analysis demonstrate that climatic and environmental variables strongly affect the dynamics and spatial distribution of adult rat fleas, and may at least in part explain the spatial and temporal occurrence of the human disease.</p>
              <sec id="sec021">
                <title>Spatial patterns of flea abundance</title>
                <p>We used accessible data [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to identify the climatic and environmental drivers of the spatial distribution of <italic>Xenopsylla</italic> rat fleas; these drivers were then used to produce a predictive map of flea abundance on Reunion Island. Our analysis showed that low precipitation and high temperatures favor flea abundance. The effect of temperature and humidity on fleas’ development has been experimentally measured in a handful of species. A recent experimental study showed that the development of <italic>X</italic>. <italic>cheopis</italic> and <italic>Synopsyllus fonquerniei</italic>, both known vectors of plague in Madagascar, was shortened by elevated temperatures while no effect of humidity was noticed in the used experimental conditions [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Krasnov and colleagues (2001) showed that egg hatch as well as larval development of <italic>Xenopsylla conformis</italic> and <italic>Xenopsylla ramesis</italic>, both parasites of the same rodent species, were strongly affected by temperature and humidity [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, an examination of the rodent burrows in different habitats revealed large differences in burrow architecture possibly associated with different microclimates [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In Reunion Island, heavy rainfall and the architecture of burrows in the windward coast may be unsuitable to the development of <italic>Xenopsylla</italic> spp. and hence lead to a virtual absence of these vectors on the East side of the island, whereas higher temperatures favor the development of <italic>Xenopsylla</italic> spp. in the West side of the island.</p>
                <p>According to our results, different land cover types also impacted the <italic>Xenopsylla</italic> GFI, namely the land cover classes “discontinuous urban”, “forest”, “herbaceous vegetation” and “agriculture”, all positively associated with rat flea abundance. This result suggests that landscapes favorable to <italic>Xenopsylla</italic> fleas on Reunion Island are preferentially located in suburban or rural areas. Moreover, such landscapes are generally fragmented and composed of a mix of land covers, including residential, agricultural and natural areas. The role of land use and land cover on flea indices was also demonstrated in previous studies conducted in Lushoto District, Tanzania, revealing that fallow land and natural forest had higher flea indices [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Of note, the land cover classes “continuous urban”, and “water” were both negatively correlated with rat flea abundance in the univariate analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0009029.s004">S4 Table</xref>). On the other hand, the land cover classes “shrub vegetation” and “barren land” were not retained in the multivariate model, although they were positively and significantly correlated with rat flea abundance in the univariate analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0009029.s004">S4 Table</xref>). These results stress the need for additional sampling studies to decipher the role of landscape elements in rat flea abundances in Reunion Island.</p>
                <p>The developed predictive map of <italic>Xenopsylla</italic> fleas significantly overlaps that of murine typhus human incident cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009029.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), suggesting that risk areas for murine typhus on Reunion Island are mainly located in suburban or rural areas of the western leeward coast. Of note, this pattern differs from those shown in different geographic contexts: for example, a seroprevalence survey conducted in Vientiane, Lao PDR, demonstrated that murine typhus transmission occurs mainly in densely populated urban areas [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Indeed, the impact of abiotic factors is expected to be different in each environmental setting, notably because of the composition and abundance of the host and vector species that are locally involved in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>typhi</italic> transmission.</p>

                <title>Temporal dynamics of flea infestation</title>
                <p>In our study, a 12-month trapping design was set up to investigate the temporal dynamics of rat fleas. The measured <italic>Xenopsylla</italic> GFI reflects the flea infestation of the rodent population throughout the year. Our analysis highlighted GFI variations over time in relation with temperature and rainfall: hot (daily maximum temperature above 27°C) and dry (maximum rainfall over the last 42 days below 60 mm) conditions favor the infestation of rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009029.g004">Fig 4</xref>). This result is in keeping with the spatial distribution of <italic>Xenopsylla</italic> fleas modeled using a distinct dataset and showing highest infestation in the hot and dry regions of the island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009029.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>
                <p>There have been few investigations of flea abundance in tropical environments [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Makundi and co-workers [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] documented a strong seasonality in flea infestation in Tanzania with a marked peak in December that mirrors figures presented herein, although Tanzania and Reunion Island are obviously different environmentally. An older survey also reported sharp but asynchronous peaks in <italic>X</italic>. <italic>cheopis</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>fonquiernei</italic> abundance on rats trapped in Tananarive, Madagascar [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These pioneering investigations stress the need for studies of the biological cycles of fleas, including that of off-host stages that remain dramatically overlooked. It is also of utmost importance to decipher the fate of adult fleas after the seasonal peak of abundance. Some previous experimental studies have revealed strong but complex responses of adult rat fleas in response to relative humidity. Indeed, unfed adult fleas were shown to aggregate at the dry side of experimental chambers when exposed to increasing relative humidity [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, the activity (number of moving, crowling and jumping fleas) of adult unfed fleas was strongly positively correlated with increasing relative humidity [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
                <p>We can hypothesize that, following abundance peak, fleas leave their hosts to reproduce, or that increasing humidity and temperature at the beginning of the humid season favors rat-human host shift as a consequence of increased activity of fleas, as suggested by experimental data on other <italic>Xenopsylla</italic> species [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although the biological mechanisms underlying these dynamics are unknown, it is important to note that peaks of flea infestation and human cases of murine typhus examined herein nearly coincide in December (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009029.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Therefore, understanding the biological cycle of rat fleas at this period is pivotal and warrants further investigation.</p>

                <title>Consequences for human disease control recommendations</title>
                <p>The predictive map of flea infestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009029.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and the seasonality of flea infestation should both be considered for targeted rat control programs on Reunion Island. Indeed, the predictive map shows that only a limited portion of the island is actually home to a significant abundance of rat fleas. The seasonality of infestation further suggests that, in highly infested areas, flea infestation may be of concern mainly during the first months of the hot humid season. Rat control is carried out throughout the island and year-round to protect farms and crops, as well as vulnerable flora and fauna of the island. In addition to town halls, two regional services are in charge of rodents control in sugar cane fields, and in cattle and pig farms, using rodenticide. In the absence of associated control of fleas, rodenticides have a limited impact on fleas [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and rat control may actually increase the exposure of human populations to these invertebrate vectors. For this reason, we propose the use of Kartman boxes–a method associating an anticoagulant rodenticide and an insecticide–as recently tested in Madagascar [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and this only in areas and seasons at risk, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. in the West and South portions of the island at the end of the dry season.</p>
                <p>With regard to public health, these findings suggest that family doctors located in the affected areas of the south and the west should be informed regarding murine typhus risk as well as diagnosis and treatment before the annual high-risk period. Hygiene promotion and information on the disease transmission together with advice to protect pets from flea infestation could also be offered to the population living in these affected areas.</p>

                <title>Limitations and perspectives</title>
                <p>In this study, we investigated the impact of environmental and climatic drivers on the abundance of adult rat fleas on Reunion Island, and our results showed significant relationships between environmental conditions, the abundance of rat fleas, and the incidence of murine typhus in humans. Published data showed that the occurrence of rat fleas is strongly structured geographically on Reunion Island [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which oriented our study towards the exploration of invertebrate vectors. However, both analyzed datasets only included outdoor trapping results [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Indoor trapping of rats and rat fleas would be necessary to complement our study. The role of <italic>Ctenocephalides felis</italic>–the cat flea–as a vector of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>typhi</italic> should also be investigated [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
                <p>Moreover, other non-exclusive hypotheses could be examined in the future, especially the temporal dynamics of infection in fleas (H3) and of the exposure of humans to rats (H4). Measuring <italic>R</italic>. <italic>typhi</italic> prevalence in rat fleas throughout the year will certainly complement our understanding of the dynamics of human disease. Addressing the temporal variations in rat abundance could be achieved through capture-marking-recapture experiments [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which could be implemented specifically in the sites with highest risk, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. sites with highest human seroprevalence or, in the absence of such data, in sites with dense human population and highest estimated GFI. A seasonal increase in human exposure to rats may be concomitant with the harvest of sugar cane (June-December), during which rats are forced to disperse and possibly seek shelter in or near human habitats.</p>
                <p>Finally, it should be noted that Reunion Island can be considered as a simplified environmental setting, as it is a relatively closed system sheltering only two rat species, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>rattus</italic> and <italic>R</italic>. <italic>norvegicus</italic>, together with two rat flea species competent for <italic>R</italic>. <italic>typhi</italic> transmission, namely <italic>X</italic>. <italic>cheopis</italic> and <italic>X</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic>. In comparison, the neighboring island of Madagascar shelters almost 30 species of endemic rodents and an even higher number of endemic fleas [<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009029.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], in addition to the introduced rodent and flea species that are common to both islands. Thus, the extrapolation of study results obtained on Reunion Island would certainly not be relevant for other Indian Ocean islands. However, the methods used here, combining GIS and statistical inference approaches to explore the different links between environment, reservoirs, vectors and human hosts, could be applied to other geographic contexts.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend “Minor Revision” or “Accept”. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: I found the choice of words odd and awkward in a few places, and specific suggestions for more appropriate word choices and sentence structure are listed below. </p>
              <p>Specific suggestions:</p>
              <p>Line 27: change structuration to structure, delete "incident" before cases</p>
              <p>Line 29: change "compartment" to "component"</p>
              <p>Line 30: change "of" to "from"</p>
              <p>Line 49; awkward sentence: change “which number of cases” to “as the number of human cases”….</p>
              <p>Line 52: delete "thus"</p>
              <p>Line 67: change "highlight" to "determine"</p>
              <p>Line 78: add comma after niche</p>
              <p>Line 84: change "setups" to "settings"</p>
              <p>Line 94: change "up-cited" to "previous"</p>
              <p>Line 94: Authors state “its emergence in Reunion Island may have</p>
              <p> resulted from suboptimal surveillance and diagnosis prior the identification of the first</p>
              <p>incident cases in 2012. This sentence needs to be reworded…e.g. detection of emergence may have been delayed due to suboptimal surveillance and diagnosis prior to identification of the first human cases in 2012. </p>
              <p>Line 97: disease should be diseases</p>
              <p>Line 100: structuration is a strange word, replace with structure here and throughout the paper</p>
              <p>Line 101: add "with" after seasonality, and before cases</p>
              <p>Line 104: “it typically is” should be “as is typical”</p>
              <p>Line 118: change "up-cited" to "previously stated"</p>
              <p>Line 120: incident can be deleted…human cases is sufficient</p>
              <p>Line 124: "aiming" should be "aimed"</p>
              <p>Line 133; insert comma after surveillance, delete “an access to”</p>
              <p>Line 134; insert “access” before “to health data”</p>
              <p>Lines 135 and 136: replace “run” with “conducted according to”</p>
              <p>Line 155: replace “a” with “rodent”</p>
              <p>Line 169: add “in humans” after cases, reemphasize throughout that you are referring to incidence or cases of human typhus</p>
              <p>Line 259: Univariable should be univariate here and elsewhere</p>
              <p>Line 260: multivariable should be multivariate here and elsewhere</p>
              <p>Line 320: replace “leading to” with “and a” (non specific symptoms don’t lead to lack of awareness but the two combined lead to underestimation)</p>
              <p>Line 323: replace “explored rodents and rodent fleas compartments” with “ analyzed factors related to rodents and rodent fleas, …. </p>
              <p>Line 324: replace “the presented analysis enlightens” with “ The results of our analysis demonstrates that climatic and environmental variables strongly affect….</p>

                <bold>Summary and General Comments</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: In general, this is an interesting and well-organized study on factors associated with rats and rat fleas and the incidence of human typhus on Reunion Island. The authors did a nice job describing the problem, their study design and their findings and relating that to broader human health implications.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript by Tran and colleagues describes the environmental conditions that appear favorable to Xenopsylla infestation of rats on Reunion Island, where murine typhus has emerged as a cause of illness – especially in the dryer areas of the south and western parts of the island. On a local level (i.e., Reunion Island) the results can have an impact on control efforts. Of broader interest, the authors’ approach could help others postulate how to understand and approach factors associated with R. typhi transmission in other regions. Below are some minor suggestions and queries for the authors’ consideration. </p>
              <p>Line 55: Suggest qualifying the phrase “main determinants” as of those investigated within the confines of this study. </p>
              <p>Lines 87 – 94: The details regarding the emergence of chikungunya, dengue, and how they are different than that of R. typhi is not necessary for an already lengthy introduction. </p>
              <p>Line 97: Suggest finding an alternate phrase for “off the radar.” </p>
              <p>Line 104: Provide citation(s) (additional to #10) to support that rats are dispersed in a widespread manner on tropical islands. </p>
              <p>Line 177 – 178: How is the serologic confirmation by the reference center different than the previously stated serologic criteria? If different, the methods or criteria should be stated. If the same, the reference center can be mentioned as a resource in the text but not a specific criterion in the bulleted list. </p>
              <p>Line 229: Very minor: The phrase “GFI index” seems redundant. Would just “GFI” suffice? </p>
              <p>Line 297 – 298: Can the authors provide the length of lag time between rapid decrease in GFI and the eventual decrease in human cases? Although it might be expected that there might be a lag, this might be counter intuitive to some readers. The lag time length (if relatively short) might help put things into more plausible context. </p>
              <p>Lines 346 – 354: Can the authors’ compare and contrast the types of land cover classes here (those with impact versus those without impact) and offer hypotheses as to why they are different? Although some differences in regard to presence of reservoirs/vectors seem obvious (i.e., continuous urban and water), others are not (e.g., shrub vegetation versus herbaceous vegetation).</p>
