                <p>An effective and widely used vaccine could reduce the burden of dengue virus (DENV) around the world. DENV is endemic in Puerto Rico, where the dengue vaccine CYD-TDV is currently under consideration as a control measure. CYD-TDV has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in vaccinees who had prior dengue virus infection. However, in vaccinees who had no prior dengue virus infection, the vaccine had a modestly elevated risk of hospitalization and severe disease. The WHO therefore recommended a strategy of pre-vaccination screening and vaccination of seropositive persons. To estimate the cost-effectiveness and benefits of this intervention (i.e., screening and vaccination of seropositive persons) in Puerto Rico, we simulated 10 years of the intervention in 9-year-olds using an agent-based model. Across the entire population, we found that 5.5% (4.6%-6.3%) of dengue hospitalizations could be averted. However, we also found that 0.057 (0.045–0.073) additional hospitalizations could occur for every 1,000 people in Puerto Rico due to DENV-naïve children who were vaccinated following a false-positive test results for prior exposure. The ratio of the averted hospitalizations among all vaccinees to additional hospitalizations among DENV-naïve vaccinees was estimated to be 19 (13–24). At a base case cost of vaccination of 382 USD, we found an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 122,000 USD per QALY gained. Our estimates can provide information for considerations to introduce the CYD-TDV vaccine in Puerto Rico.</p>

                <p>The first dengue vaccine, known as CYD-TDV, is currently under consideration as a public health tool in Puerto Rico, where dengue is endemic. Although the vaccine protects individuals with prior exposure to dengue virus, individuals vaccinated without prior dengue virus infection could experience a higher chance of severe disease. To avoid vaccinating individuals who have not been exposed to dengue virus, screening for prior infection before vaccination is recommended. Understanding the potential impacts of this intervention in specific settings can help public health decision makers to balance economic and health benefits to consider the implementation of this vaccine. In this study, we estimated the impacts of incorporating screening and vaccination in Puerto Rico for the next 10 years. We found that the vaccine could have a positive impact in reducing severe dengue by preventing 5.5% of hospitalizations, but it could also cause 1.6 hospitalizations for every 1,000 vaccinated who had a false-positive screening result. We also found that this intervention could be cost-effective in Puerto Rico at a cost of 382 USD.</p>

              <p>Dengue is considered one of the most important mosquito-borne viral diseases affecting humans, with half the world’s population living in areas at risk [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Dengue virus (DENV) has been estimated to infect between 100 to 390 million individuals per year. Between 51 to 96 million of these infections result in disease episodes [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This disease has been of great concern in Latin America, which had a record number of dengue cases in 2019, with 2.7 million cases and 1,200 deaths reported to health systems [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the absence of an effective vaccine against dengue, vector control has been the primary intervention available to reduce virus spread, but the evidence for the effectiveness of vector control to sustainably reduce dengue incidence is limited [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Currently, one dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) is available and other vaccine candidates are showing promising results [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Recent analyses of CYD-TDV vaccine trials showed an increased risk of severe dengue upon subsequent natural infection among vaccinees without previous exposure to dengue virus [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In light of this finding, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends pre-vaccination screening to help ensure that only those with previous exposure (DENV-exposed) are vaccinated [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The United States Food and Drug Administration licensed CYD-TDV for children 9–16 years living in dengue endemic areas and with documented evidence of previous dengue virus infection [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The requirement of a pre-vaccination laboratory screening for prior dengue virus infection complicates cost-effectiveness and logistical considerations for a vaccine program. The quality of pre-vaccination screening tests is also a critical consideration because test specificity can affect the number of false positive test results and because vaccinating a child with a false positive screening test result can put the child at risk for more severe dengue illness if infected. It is important therefore to estimate the potential health and economic benefits and risks of using CYD-TDV when paired with a pre-vaccination screening strategy.</p>
              <p>Several studies have suggested that pre-vaccination screening with CYD-TDV could be cost-effective in some settings [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but high specificity of screening is required to minimize individual risk, as well as high sensitivity to maximize population benefits [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Pre-vaccination screening is also recommended in Latin America [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The health benefits and cost-effectiveness of pre-vaccination screening for the Philippines and Brazil have been investigated in a recent study [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. That analysis showed likely reduced disease incidence with limited adverse events at acceptable costs from this intervention with pre-vaccination screening and subsequent vaccination with CYD-TDV in areas with moderate to high-transmission intensity. Dengue is also endemic to several tropical and sub-tropical jurisdictions associated with the United States, including Puerto Rico [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A program of pre-vaccination screening coupled with CYD-TDV given to seropositive individuals is currently being considered to reduce the burden of dengue in Puerto Rico [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this study, we evaluate the epidemiological and economic impacts of pre-vaccination screening and subsequent vaccination with CYD-TDV in Puerto Rico.</p>

              <p>We estimated the epidemiological benefits and cost-effectiveness of the intervention over a 10-year time-frame. We based this study on a previous analysis of the impact of this intervention in various transmission settings [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and we adjusted transmission parameters and costs to represent Puerto Rico.</p>

                <p>To evaluate the impact of a pre-vaccination screening intervention in Puerto Rico, we modified an agent-based model of dengue transmission with humans and mosquitoes represented as agents. This model has been described in previous publications [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. While our model has been calibrated to demographic and geographic data from Iquitos, Peru [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the model can represent DENV transmission in a generic setting [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and has been modified in this study to simulate DENV transmission dynamics in Puerto Rico. Our model compares two strategies, an intervention strategy and the status quo. The intervention strategy is the routine pre-vaccination screening and subsequent vaccination of seropositive of 9-year-olds in Puerto Rico. Nine-year-olds is the lowest age approved for vaccination, and has been used as a default age of vaccination in other studies [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For each of the strategies, the model population was followed for 10 years, keeping track of dengue-related health events defined as dengue virus infections, hospitalizations, and deaths.</p>

                <p>We modified the transmission parameters of the model to approximate DENV transmission dynamics of DENV in Puerto Rico. We adjusted the transmission intensity of DENV in our model to achieve the expected age-specific dengue antibody prevalence levels (<italic toggle="yes">PE</italic><sub>9</sub>) in Puerto Rico. We estimated the <italic toggle="yes">PE</italic><sub>9</sub> for Puerto Rico based on two serological studies. Coudeville et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] estimated 50% seroprevalence in 9-year-olds in areas where the CYD-TDV phase-3 trials were conducted. Argüello et al. found that 49.8% (95% CI = 43.6–56.0%) of participants between 10–18 years of age had a positive IgG anti-DENV antibodies [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We assumed a baseline of <italic toggle="yes">PE</italic><sub>9</sub> = 50%. Because of the potential negative outcomes in lower transmission settings, which could reduce the benefits of this intervention, and given the uncertainty in the estimates of <italic toggle="yes">PE</italic><sub>9</sub>, we explored a lower value of <italic toggle="yes">PE</italic><sub>9</sub> = 30%. In addition, to assess the sensitivity of our estimates to higher intensity of transmission, we simulated an alternative scenario with slightly higher transmission intensity of <italic toggle="yes">PE</italic><sub>9</sub> = 60% (Supplementary text).</p>
                <p>Individuals can be infected with DENV four times over the course of their life. Evidence suggests the second infection can cause a disproportionate level of disease severity, relative to the first infection or to the third or later infections. In the model, the effect of a vaccination on an individual is similar to a natural infection without symptoms (silent infection), which is consistent with assumptions in other models [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. If the individual is DENV-naïve, then a vaccination serves as the individual’s first (a silent) infection, and a subsequent infection may be more severe. By contrast, if the individual is DENV-exposed, then a vaccination serves as the individual’s second or later (silent) infection, which does not result in additional risk for severe disease. These assumptions are supported by empirical evidence showing that, compared to those not vaccinated, seronegative individuals vaccinated with CYD-TDV have a higher risk of hospitalization after a natural infection, whereas seropositive individuals vaccinated have a lower risk of hospitalization [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Vaccine effectiveness parameters were calibrated to the most recent dengue vaccine trial results [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we calibrated model parameters characterizing vaccine profile to vaccine trial data using a particle filtering approach, which is explained in more detail elsewhere ([<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Appendix S2).

                <p>Population-level benefits were defined as the proportion of symptomatic and hospitalized cases averted for the total population in comparison with a scenario without vaccination. Individual-level benefits were defined as the relative risk for symptomatic and hospitalized dengue of an individual child who undergoes screening and possibly vaccination compared to a child who is not given a screening or any vaccination. Since misclassification by a serologic test could result in DENV-naïve individuals receiving a vaccination that could lead to an episode of hospitalization [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we quantify the magnitude of this risk by estimating the proportion of additional hospitalizations that occurred in the model among misclassified DENV-naïve individuals who received a vaccination. We reported the number of hospitalizations in vaccinated DENV-naïve children per 1,000 children vaccinated. We also reported the ratio of averted hospitalizations among the total population divided by the number of additional hospitalizations among misclassified DENV-naïve individuals who received a vaccination. This ratio captures the trade-off between hospitalizations that are averted by vaccination and any additional hospitalizations that may be caused by the vaccination of misclassified DENV-naïve individuals. Higher values of this ratio represent better value in terms of averted hospitalizations. Finally, we reported the number of additional hospitalizations for every 1,000 population.</p>
                <p>In our simulations, we assumed that coverage of the intervention (i.e., serological screening and vaccination in the event of a positive result) was given to 80% of the target population, but evaluated an alternative scenario of lower coverage (50%) in the sensitivity analysis. We assumed that 100% of children with a positive screening result were vaccinated. The baseline values of sensitivity (0.8) and specificity (0.95) were based on a recent review of rapid diagnostic tests for determination of serostatus [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Similar values were found by the dengue branch surveillance and research laboratory [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Assuming that increasing sensitivity would result in lower specificity, and vice-versa, we assumed three additional scenarios: 1) high sensitivity (0.95) and low specificity (0.76), 2) low sensitivity (0.64) and high specificity (0.95), 3) high sensitivity (0.95) and high specificity (0.95). In a set of sensitivity analyses, we also simulated pre-vaccination screening over the full range of values of sensitivity and specificity (0–1) to find the minimum values required to achieve positive proportion of dengue cases averted.</p>

We used a public health perspective for our cost-effectiveness analysis, which included the costs of vaccination, screening, disease outcomes paid by government, as well as the quality-adjusted life-years and utility loss associated with premature death. Although this perspective could underestimate the cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective, we focused on a public health perspective to provide estimates for decisions makers in the public health sector and the health sector overall.

                <p>To evaluate the ICER, we identified a set of cost parameters. The baseline cost per fully vaccinated child was set to 382 USD (32 USD—682 USD) based on the average current price of vaccines in the US per dose that had a similar age range, recombinant technology, and recent approval (<xref rid="pntd.0009606.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009606.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Tables). The range of the vaccine cost was chosen based on the minimum and maximum values observed in the vaccines included (10 USD per dose and 227 USD per dose). The individual cost of screening was set to 30 USD, but we varied this price from 1 USD to 60 USD in sensitivity analyses.</p>
                <p>Estimates of the costs paid by the government associated with treatment of dengue cases for ambulatory cases and hospitalizations were based on estimates from 2002 to 2009 (projected to 2010) in Puerto Rico [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Using the consumer price index for medical care for Puerto Rico [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we adjusted these costs from 2010 values to 2019 USD. The cost of an ambulatory case was set to 315 USD (252–378) and the cost of a hospitalization was set to 2,132 USD (1,705–2,558). Future costs were discounted by 3% annually.</p>
                <p>For the cost-effectiveness results, our primary health outcome was the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), which is a health-related quality of life index that ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 with 0.0 representing a state of death and 1.0 representing perfect health for one year. Following approaches used in previous studies of dengue [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we estimated the QALYs gained from the intervention based on lost quality of life due to dengue fever and severe dengue. We used disutility parameters (D), or QALY decrements, that were taken from a study that estimated the quality of life associated with dengue fever and hospitalizations, conducted by Zeng et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These values are listed in <xref rid="pntd.0009606.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.

                  <p>From a population level, our simulations showed that the intervention resulted in averted symptomatic cases across all four scenarios for different levels of sensitivity and specificity of pre-vaccination screening tests (<xref rid="pntd.0009606.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, left panel). Estimates of the numbers of symptomatic cases and hospitalizations averted for each scenario of transmission intensity are shown in <xref rid="pntd.0009606.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. More than 3,000 hospitalizations were averted in the baseline scenario and in the four scenarios that investigated different levels of prior exposure and pre-vaccination screening test properties (<xref rid="pntd.0009606.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, right panel) with 5.5% (4.6% - 6.3%) of hospitalizations averted when <italic toggle="yes">PE</italic><sub>9</sub> = 50%, and 3% (2% - 3.6%) when <italic toggle="yes">PE</italic><sub>9</sub> = 30% (<xref rid="pntd.0009606.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, right panel). Higher sensitivity (0.95) and lower specificity (0.76) resulted in lower proportions of hospitalizations averted. Lower sensitivity (0.64) and higher specificity (0.99) also lowered the proportion of hospitalizations averted to 4.7% (3.8% - 5.3%) when <italic toggle="yes">PE</italic><sub>9</sub> = 50%, and to 2.8% (2.1% - 2.8%) when <italic toggle="yes">PE</italic><sub>9</sub> = 30%.

                <p>We estimated the number of hospitalizations due to false positives of DENV-naïve children who were therefore vaccinated. We estimated these hospitalizations to be around 1.6 (1.3–2.1) per 1,000 vaccinees in the baseline scenario of sensitivity (0.8) and specificity (0.95) (<italic toggle="yes">PE</italic><sub>9</sub> = 50%, <xref rid="pntd.0009606.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, left panel).

Reducing specificity to increase sensitivity resulted in more than double the baseline hospitalizations in the DENV-naïve group. In contrast, reducing sensitivity to increase specificity to 0.99 reduced the number of hospitalizations to about half the baseline number. We also found that for every one additional hospitalization in the group of vaccinated DENV-naïve individuals there were about 19 (13–24) (<italic toggle="yes">PE</italic><sub>9</sub> = 50%) hospitalizations averted overall in the baseline scenario (<xref rid="pntd.0009606.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, right panel).

In proportion to the overall population, we estimated a total of additional hospitalizations of 0.057 (0.045–0.073) per 1,000 population in the baseline setting of transmission.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Using an agent-based model of dengue virus transmission, we simulated the impact of a routine program of pre-vaccination screening of 9-year-olds with subsequent vaccination of seropositive individuals, at dengue transmission levels that were calibrated to Puerto Rico. Assuming a moderate and low transmission intensity (PE<sub>9</sub> = [50%, 30%]) in Puerto Rico, we found that this intervention could be beneficial at the population-level and less so at the individual-level, as long as the serological pre-vaccination screening test has at least moderate values of sensitivity and high specificity. In sensitivity analyses, we found that this intervention could be more beneficial and cost-effective in the event that conditions of transmission in Puerto Rico are higher (<italic toggle="yes">PE</italic><sub>9</sub> = 60%) than our baseline assumption. We also found that a minimum specificity of 0.6 for serological screening was required to ensure that the intervention would not result in an increase of hospitalizations due to vaccination of DENV-naïve individuals misclassified with a positive result for prior exposure. Additional epidemiological impact from different scenarios of transmission intensity can be explored in our webapp (<ext-link xlink:href="http://denguevaccine.crc.nd.edu/" ext-link-type="uri">http://denguevaccine.crc.nd.edu</ext-link>). In a cost-effectiveness analysis under our baseline assumptions, we estimated an ICER of around 122,000 USD per QALY gained. This value was sensitive to changes in the underlying transmission intensity and uncertainty in the accuracy and cost of serological screening, and uncertainty in vaccination costs.</p>
              <p>A sensitivity analysis showed that higher specificity would be more important than high sensitivity for epidemiological benefits as well as cost-effectiveness. This, ensuring highly specific pre-vaccination screening tests to minimize the number of seronegative individuals misclassified as seropositive is clearly important. Additional hospitalizations caused by vaccinating misclassified DENV-naïve children is a unique and important issue for the use of CYD-TDV. In our baseline scenario, our results suggest that for every 1,000 vaccinated children, around 2 extra cases would be caused (4 in a lower transmission setting). This number more than doubled when we adjusted the parameters of the pre-vaccination screening test, reducing the specificity of screening from 0.95 (with sensitivity 0.8) to 0.76 (with sensitivity 0.95).</p>
              <p>We focused on a scenario where 80% of 9-year-olds were routinely given pre-vaccination screening and subsequent vaccination of seropositives. However, this level of intervention coverage (80%) may not occur in practice. There are many possible reasons that widespread use of pre-vaccination screening and any subsequent vaccinations may not be achieved. A number of challenges, common to many vaccines, may potentially reduce intervention coverage, such as: (1) the vaccine and screening tests may not be given a strong recommendation or endorsement from the medical community, (2) concerns of patients and parents over the perceived benefits and perceived safety of the vaccination, (3) costs of the pre-screening tests and vaccination, and (4) any number of logistical challenges that could occur with a complex intervention procedure that includes a pre-vaccination screening test that is potentially followed up with three doses of a vaccination, with each dose given approximately 6 months apart. Our results suggest that the cost-effectiveness could be affected by a lower uptake, slightly increasing the ICER, especially for QALYs gained and averted symptomatic cases in low transmission scenarios.</p>
              <p>Generally, our results are consistent with other studies that evaluated dengue vaccination in Puerto Rico. Some of the differences in the results appear to be due to differences in important assumptions. At a vaccine cost of 20 USD per dose (60 USD for three doses), Coudeville et al. found that, using the GDP per capita as a threshold for the willingness to pay for a DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Year) averted, this intervention could result in cost-savings [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. One important difference is that our study used a higher cost of vaccination in the baseline scenario. At the lower bound of vaccination cost assumed in our study (32 USD for three doses), the cost per QALY gained was between 15,000 USD and 57,000 USD. Similar results were found by Zeng et al., although they simulated universal vaccination without screening [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our study differs in the assumption of the costs of clinical care. We focused on the average cost paid by the government (1,615 USD) [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the two studies mentioned above [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] used the overall direct cost of hospitalization (4,135 USD), which includes the cost paid by insurance, households, and employers. While these could account for some differences between the results of our studies, our sensitivity analyses suggest that changes to health care costs would only modestly affect the ICER estimates. At the base case of vaccine cost of 382 USD, dengue vaccination was estimated to cost 122,000 USD per QALY gained. Our estimate for the cost-effectiveness of dengue screening combined with vaccination falls within the range of economic values that have been estimated for some of the other adolescent vaccines in the United States [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For example, the cost per QALY gained for influenza vaccination of adolescents 12–17 years who are not at high risk was 119,000 in 2006 USD [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although our model has been carefully parameterized our approach has some limitations. First, we did not explicitly simulate demographic characteristics of Puerto Rico. Instead, we parameterized our model to represent generic settings of transmission intensity with a demographic structure appropriate to Iquitos, Peru. The assumption of similar age-structures can result in some differences in transmission patterns. Nonetheless, in previous analyses with this model, our approach showed similar projections on the impact of dengue vaccination to seven other models [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, we assumed that prevalence was similar across regions of Puerto Rico based on studies of seroprevalence [<xref rid="pntd.0009606.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Although comprehensive seroprevalence data by municipalities in Puerto Rico is not currently available, less populated municipalities would likely have lower prevalence than densely populated urban areas. In consequence, our assumption of <italic toggle="yes">PE</italic><sub>9</sub> = 50% would likely cover the majority of children who live in densely populated areas. Ideally, dengue seroprevalence studies could be performed to measure prevalence in less densely populated areas before introduction of the vaccine. Nonetheless, our results show that this intervention has epidemiological and economic benefits even in lower transmission scenarios (<italic toggle="yes">PE</italic><sub>9</sub> = 30%), as long as specificity of screening is high.</p>
              <p>Another limitation of our model is that we are simulating homogeneous circulation of DENV serotypes. Although this assumption is unrealistic, given that dengue outbreaks are characterized by the dominance of one of the serotypes, it would be infeasible to make projections of the serotype-specific DENV importations for the next ten years. Under a scenario in which vaccine efficacy is balanced across serotypes, our estimates would likely remain robust to assumptions on the dominance of serotypes. However, in the event that transmission in Puerto Rico were to be dominated by a specific serotype, and vaccine efficacy were lower for that specific serotype, our estimates could overestimate the impact of CYD-TDV vaccination. In our baseline parameter for the cost of a vaccinated child, we did not explicitly include some factors such as transportation costs for the child and a caregiver, and storage and distribution of vaccine materials. These additional factors would likely serve to increase the cost per capita of a fully vaccinated child relative to our baseline assumption, which is the reason for the extensive sensitivity analyses included around vaccine costs and for the relative broad ranges applied to this parameter.</p>
              <p>In summary, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of serologic screening and subsequent vaccination on the range of 74,000 to 182,000 USD per QALY, with a range dependent on assumptions about background prevalence, vaccine cost, and other factors. Model results comport reasonably well with other epidemiological models and with other estimates of economic value. Our analysis suggests that epidemiological benefits can be achieved from this intervention in Puerto Rico for the baseline assumptions of sensitivity and specificity. If multiple diagnostic tests were to be available, the specificity of the test should be prioritized given that it is crucial to minimize the additional hospitalizations in vaccinees without previous exposure to DENV. In conclusion, decision makers in Puerto Rico considering the implementation of this vaccine need to contemplate the potential benefits and risks of the intervention at the individual and population level. Our detailed computational model can provide relevant information that can be used to support decision making.</p>

                <bold>Key Review Criteria Required for Acceptance?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>As you describe the new analyses required for acceptance, please consider the following:</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Methods</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated?</p>
              <p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p>
              <p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p>
              <p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: This is an economic analysis of the currently favored strategy for Dengue vaccination, namely vaccination at 9 years of age or above of children who are seropositive for Dengue, but not children who are seronegative (the former are protected, but the latter are put at enhanced risk of serious illness by vaccination). The model is applied to Puerto Rico, although data from Peru were used to develop it.</p>
              <p>The objectives are clear. This is a modeling exercise without a stated expected outcome. The data are derived from other publications, however it's clear what population is included. I am not a modeller, so can't judge directly the methods. There are no ethical concerns.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: (No Response)</p>

                <bold>Results</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p>
              <p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The analysis presented matches the plan. The results are presented with good clarity-- a few suggestions are included in this review. One aspect of the analysis is omitted from discussion, which is the case in which prevalence of Dengue at or below 9 years of age is greater than 50%. It's probably wise to limit the options presented in detail for discussion, but would seem useful to included some mention of it.</p>
              <p>Figures and Tables are clear.</p>

                <bold>Conclusions</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p>
              <p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?</p>
              <p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The conclusions are supported by the analysis. Limitations of the analysis are described clearly, though one should be called out in the introduction and methods more clearly: the use of government costs only as the 'cost' component definitely skews the cost-benefit analysis in an unfavorable way.</p>
              <p>Public health relevance is addressed, particularly the very important point that the specificity of tests applied prior to vaccination greatly alters the risks and benefits of the vaccination strategy.</p>

                <bold>Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend “Minor Revision” or “Accept”. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors state that the code will be available on GITHUB. This is excellent, but from the statement itself, it’s not clear that this satisfies the requirement that the data be made available. It appears that all data are from public sources and most or all are given within the manuscript as well, in which case this could simply be stated.</p>
              <p>Line 47, spell-check screening</p>
              <p>Line 102, it would seem that evidence for the other side of this coin should also be cited here to complete the argument—that is, the effect of vaccination after prior infection. This seems to be in Table 1.</p>
              <p>Line 236, “In the baseline scenario of costs”…. Please spell this baseline out again, so the reader doesn’t have to go back through the manuscript to find it and differentiate from what follows.</p>
              <p>Line 244 -- In terms OF?</p>
              <p>Line 315 – The point about varying effects depending upon the dominance, year to year, of different strains, is a good one. It would be enlightening to discuss this a bit further—is there a worst-case scenario and best-case scenario that could be described, at least in general terms? It would seem that the worst-case scenario is worth discussing.</p>
              <p>General – PE9 = 60% was simulated but is not discussed at all, presumably for simplicity. A statement that ICER would be even more favorable at 60% and a pointer to the figures/tables that are relevant would seem to be appropriate.</p>
              <p>General – The limitation of the costs to what the government pays, rather than total societal costs, while reasonable, should be very clearly stated in the introduction and methods, as it significantly decreases the figures used for economic benefit and skews the results of the paper toward an unfavorable decision about vaccination.</p>
              <p>Ref 10. Is the author correct?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: (No Response)</p>

              <p>
                <bold>Summary and General Comments</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of the strategy of screening + DENV using an agent-based modelling approach in Puerto Rico. It is a well-written manuscript addressing an important question. Most assumptions of the modelling are valid. However, I have following comments for authors to consider. </p>
              <p>1. Line 74: Please describe what is he status quo when discussing agenting-based model. It is not clear whether the status quo was the scenario without vaccine or the scenario with vaccination but without screening.</p>
              <p>2. Line 90: Mean prevalence was set at 50%. However, lower and upper bound was set as 0.3 and 0.6, respectively. Please clarify why authors assume a potential asymmetrical distribution of the prevalence. </p>
              <p>3. Line 143 mentioned that the study was conducted from a public health perspective. If I understood correctly, the authors meant to say “health system’s perspective” or “health providers perspective”. According to recommendations for conduct cost-effectiveness analyses in health (<ext-link xlink:href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2552214" ext-link-type="uri">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2552214</ext-link>), it is often recommended to conduct CEA from both societal and health system’s perspectives. Authors needs to further explain this perspective on what has been excluded or included in this perspective. It is not until line 177 did I realize the premature death was accounted for in this study. </p>
              <p>4. Line 153: The cost of vaccine varies substantially; it could be as low as 32.6 to as high as 683.8. The cost of vaccine would be a major determinations of the cost-effectiveness. It would be helpful to explain why there was such a huge variation in Puerto Rico in the discussion section. Will the group purchasing would affects the procurement price of vaccine? </p>
              <p>a. It is not clear how $382 was derived? </p>
              <p>5. Study shows that dengue seroprevalence varies among municipalities (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002159" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002159</ext-link>). Given that the prevalence and sensitivity and specific of screen would affect the cot-effectiveness of the vaccine, it would be helpful to discuss the implication of the strategy of implementation DENV in Puerto Rico in municipalities with different seroprevalence.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Mr. España,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Cost-effectiveness of Dengue Vaccination in Puerto Rico" for consideration at PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. As with all papers reviewed by the journal, your manuscript was reviewed by members of the editorial board and by several independent reviewers. The reviewers appreciated the attention to an important topic. Based on the reviews, we are likely to accept this manuscript for publication, providing that you modify the manuscript according to the review recommendations. </p>
              <p>As Associate Editor, I commend the authors for their careful response to the previous round of reviewer comments, their sophisticated simulations, factually based analyses, range of sensitivity analyses, independent funding and generally well-written manuscript.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, there is one item in the current manuscript in that threatens to mislead readers and policy makers. That concerns the baseline values of test performance. The authors rightly cite the WHO policy that appropriate use of the current dengue vaccine depends on testing to separate potential vaccines between those without prior infection (who risk slight harm from vaccination) from those with prior infection (who would gain substantial protection from vaccination). The authors’ sensitivity analyses note the importance of the accuracy of the test to make this distinction. </p>
              <p>My concern is that the current manuscript gives the misleading impression that an existing or licensed rapid test can make this distinction with the degree of accuracy that the paper hypothesizes in its base case. A 2018 paper in Lancet Global Health noted how tests then available, which were developed for testing persons with suspected dengue following a RECENT illness, would NOT be appropriate to make the necessary distinction for vaccination (Ariën KK, Wilder-Smith A. Dengue vaccine: reliably determining previous exposure. Lancet Global Health. 2018;6(8):e830–1). </p>
              <p>That 2018 paper noted two problems. The existing rapid tests were not sufficiently sensitive for remote infections (thereby decreasing sensitivity) and they could cross-react with Zika (thereby decreasing specificity at the same time). The current manuscript takes its central values from the by Luo et al (Clinical Microbiology and Infection 25 (2019) 659e666). Luo et al repeatedly noted that the literature on the performance of dengue testing was based on ill patients suspected of having dengue, as illustrated by the following excerpts from pp. 661 and 665: </p>
              <p>“No studies examined the performance of dengue RDTs to detect remote previous infection…. Overall, there were no studies that directly evaluated the use of RDTs for determination of dengue serostatus, as all studies examined RDT performance in the context of either all samples from patients with possible DENV infection, and/or a subset from samples of secondary infection or convalescent time-points after recent DENV infection. Although all studies included samples from dengue-endemic areas, none of them provided information on vaccination or infection status of patients for other ﬂaviviruses, all of which may lead to cross-reactivity with dengue serological testing…. Development of new dengue RDTs or modiﬁcation of currently available RDTs may be the most beneﬁcial for vaccination screening.”</p>
              <p>The paper presents no evidence that there is a test licensed for use in Puerto Rico addresses these shortcomings. If there is such evidence, I believe the authors should include it in their manuscript. If such evidence does not exist, then I suggest the authors consider acknowledging the constraint and adjusting their manuscript accordingly. They may wish to consider one or more of the following adjustments: First, they could consider their base values as aspirational, so their base values would apply if an when a “Rapid Vaccination Dengue Test” were licensed and available. Second, they could offer and justify more modest values of sensitivity and specificity if existing tests were repurposed for this pre-vaccination testing despite their limitations. Third, they could consider laboratory-based tests instead of rapid tests. These would be more accurate but entail added costs, logistical challenges, and likely lower vaccination rates.</p>
              <p>A few minor editorial suggestions follow, each identified by its line number.</p>
              <p>19 It would be helpful to express the iatrogenic additional dengue hospitalizations on the same scale (per 1000 population) as the hospitalizations averted.</p>
              <p>52 A stronger statement would be that other candidates are showing promising results.</p>
              <p>60 a vaccine program</p>
              <p>94 in other studies. Note: age 9 was also considered in reference 13</p>
              <p>110 “many times” – four times would be more precise</p>
              <p>121 consider rewording the sentence to clarify that “compared to those not vaccinated” applies to the entire sentence.</p>
              <p>142 To facilitate comparison, it would also be helpful to report the additional hospitalizations per 1,000 population.</p>
              <p>153 See discussion above on sensitivity and specificity and choice of a rapid test.</p>
              <p>154 we (lower case) assumed</p>
              <p>329 [Zeng] omitted the cost of screening. Suggest changing to: “simulated universal screening without screening.”</p>
              <p>358 it would be unfeasible [suggest changing to “infeasible.”]</p>
              <p>446 Consider updating the citation as this paper is now published.</p>
              <p>468 cost-benefit thresholds</p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>

              <p>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</p>
              <p>***********************</p>
              <p>As Associate Editor, I commend the authors for their careful response to the previous round of reviewer comments, their sophisticated simulations, factually based analyses, range of sensitivity analyses, independent funding and generally well-written manuscript.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, there is one item in the current manuscript in that threatens to mislead readers and policy makers. That concerns the baseline values of test performance. The authors rightly cite the WHO policy that appropriate use of the current dengue vaccine depends on testing to separate potential vaccines between those without prior infection (who risk slight harm from vaccination) from those with prior infection (who would gain substantial protection from vaccination). The authors’ sensitivity analyses note the importance of the accuracy of the test to make this distinction. </p>
              <p>My concern is that the current manuscript gives the misleading impression that an existing or licensed rapid test can make this distinction with the degree of accuracy that the paper hypothesizes in its base case. A 2018 paper in Lancet Global Health noted how tests then available, which were developed for testing persons with suspected dengue following a RECENT illness, would NOT be appropriate to make the necessary distinction for vaccination (Ariën KK, Wilder-Smith A. Dengue vaccine: reliably determining previous exposure. Lancet Global Health. 2018;6(8):e830–1). </p>
              <p>That 2018 paper noted two problems. The existing rapid tests were not sufficiently sensitive for remote infections (thereby decreasing sensitivity) and they could cross-react with Zika (thereby decreasing specificity at the same time). The current manuscript takes its central values from the by Luo et al (Clinical Microbiology and Infection 25 (2019) 659e666). Luo et al repeatedly noted that the literature on the performance of dengue testing was based on ill patients suspected of having dengue, as illustrated by the following excerpts from pp. 661 and 665: </p>
              <p>“No studies examined the performance of dengue RDTs to detect remote previous infection…. Overall, there were no studies that directly evaluated the use of RDTs for determination of dengue serostatus, as all studies examined RDT performance in the context of either all samples from patients with possible DENV infection, and/or a subset from samples of secondary infection or convalescent time-points after recent DENV infection. Although all studies included samples from dengue-endemic areas, none of them provided information on vaccination or infection status of patients for other ﬂaviviruses, all of which may lead to cross-reactivity with dengue serological testing…. Development of new dengue RDTs or modiﬁcation of currently available RDTs may be the most beneﬁcial for vaccination screening.”</p>
              <p>The paper presents no evidence that there is a test licensed for use in Puerto Rico addresses these shortcomings. If there is such evidence, I believe the authors should include it in their manuscript. If such evidence does not exist, then I suggest the authors consider acknowledging the constraint and adjusting their manuscript accordingly. They may wish to consider one or more of the following adjustments: First, they could consider their base values as aspirational, so their base values would apply if an when a “Rapid Vaccination Dengue Test” were licensed and available. Second, they could offer and justify more modest values of sensitivity and specificity if existing tests were repurposed for this pre-vaccination testing despite their limitations. Third, they could consider laboratory-based tests instead of rapid tests. These would be more accurate but entail added costs, logistical challenges, and likely lower vaccination rates.</p>
              <p>A few minor editorial suggestions follow, each identified by its line number.</p>
              <p>19 It would be helpful to express the iatrogenic additional dengue hospitalizations on the same scale (per 1000 population) as the hospitalizations averted.</p>
              <p>52 A stronger statement would be that other candidates are showing promising results.</p>
              <p>60 a vaccine program</p>
              <p>94 in other studies. Note: age 9 was also considered in reference 13</p>
              <p>110 “many times” – four times would be more precise</p>
              <p>121 consider rewording the sentence to clarify that “compared to those not vaccinated” applies to the entire sentence.</p>
              <p>142 To facilitate comparison, it would also be helpful to report the additional hospitalizations per 1,000 population.</p>
              <p>153 See discussion above on sensitivity and specificity and choice of a rapid test.</p>
              <p>154 we (lower case) assumed</p>
              <p>329 [Zeng] omitted the cost of screening. Suggest changing to: “simulated universal screening without screening.”</p>
              <p>358 it would be unfeasible [suggest changing to “infeasible.”]</p>
              <p>446 Consider updating the citation as this paper is now published.</p>
              <p>468 cost-benefit thresholds</p>
