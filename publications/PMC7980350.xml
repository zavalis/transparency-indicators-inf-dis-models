                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Brucellosis is a major public health problem that seriously affects developing countries and could cause significant economic losses to the livestock industry and great harm to human health. Reasonable prediction of the incidence is of great significance in controlling brucellosis and taking preventive measures.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Our human brucellosis incidence data were extracted from Shanxi Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We used seasonal-trend decomposition using Loess (STL) and monthplot to analyse the seasonal characteristics of human brucellosis in Shanxi Province from 2007 to 2017. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, a combined model of ARIMA and the back propagation neural network (ARIMA-BPNN), and a combined model of ARIMA and the Elman recurrent neural network (ARIMA-ERNN) were established separately to make predictions and identify the best model. Additionally, the mean squared error (MAE), mean absolute error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to evaluate the performance of the model.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">We observed that the time series of human brucellosis in Shanxi Province increased from 2007 to 2014 but decreased from 2015 to 2017. It had obvious seasonal characteristics, with the peak lasting from March to July every year. The best fitting and prediction effect was the ARIMA-ERNN model. Compared with those of the ARIMA model, the MAE, MSE and MAPE of the ARIMA-ERNN model decreased by 18.65, 31.48 and 64.35%, respectively, in fitting performance; in terms of prediction performance, the MAE, MSE and MAPE decreased by 60.19, 75.30 and 64.35%, respectively. Second, compared with those of ARIMA-BPNN, the MAE, MSE and MAPE of ARIMA-ERNN decreased by 9.60, 15.73 and 11.58%, respectively, in fitting performance; in terms of prediction performance, the MAE, MSE and MAPE decreased by 31.63, 45.79 and 29.59%, respectively.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The time series of human brucellosis in Shanxi Province from 2007 to 2017 showed obvious seasonal characteristics. The fitting and prediction performances of the ARIMA-ERNN model were better than those of the ARIMA-BPNN and ARIMA models. This will provide some theoretical support for the prediction of infectious diseases and will be beneficial to public health decision making.</p>

The main clinical manifestations are fever, sweating, muscle and joint pain, fatigue and other flu-like symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Because the early manifestations of human brucellosis are similar to the symptoms of flu, thus leading to early misdiagnosis and a lack of attention from patients, human brucellosis often develops into chronic brucellosis with serious complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These complications impact human labour capacity to varying degrees, limit the development of farming and animal husbandry, affect the economic and trade development of countries and even the world, and cause serious disease burden and considerable economic losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which are the main public health problems that seriously impact developing countries. Currently, there are approximately 170 countries or regions in the world affected by human brucellosis, accounting for 1/6 to 1/5 of the global population. Additionally, there are approximately 500,000 emerging cases each year, which seriously threatens people’s lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. To date, there are approximately 350 million people affected by human brucellosis, and the incidence has exceeded the highest level in China. Located on the Loess Plateau, Shanxi Province is a mixed region of farming and animal husbandry and a typical epidemic area in northern China. The reported incidence ranked first for four consecutive years from 2000 to 2003, and the reported cases from 2004 to 2007 ranked in the top five in the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Human brucellosis not only adversely affects human health but also hinders the development of animal husbandry. Therefore, reasonable prediction is important for the prevention and control of human brucellosis.</p>
              <p id="Par28">At present, the time series prediction model is the most common method for predicting the epidemic trend of an infectious disease and is mainly divided into two categories. One category is the traditional prediction model, represented by the grey prediction model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the Markov model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the exponential smoothing method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. They achieve modelling and prediction by extracting linear information. Among them, the ARIMA model is the most popular method for infectious disease prediction and is used as a benchmark to evaluate many new modelling methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The other category is a prediction model based on machine learning theory that the nonlinear mapping performance is strong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], such as Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], Random Forest (RF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], Support Vector Machines (SVM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and Radial Basis Function (RBF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and has been used to predict the incidence of infectious diseases. Nevertheless, a major limitation of models such as BPNN and SVR is that they are intrinsically static; that is, they do not account for the dynamic nature of infectious disease sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These static models can learn information only about the current time; they do not take advantage of historical information. The Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN) model obtains previous information through the receiving layer and can combine current information with historical information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This characteristic makes it one of the most powerful tools for the prediction of nonlinear time series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Time series is considered to consist of both linear and nonlinear components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Neither a single linear model nor a nonlinear model can capture the different patterns in the time series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Both types of prediction models have problems with incomplete information extraction, and the prediction accuracy needs to be further improved.</p>
              <p id="Par29">In 1969, Bates J M and Granger C W J elaborated on the combined forecasting method, and their research results attracted great attention from researchers in related fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The combined model used the unique advantages of different models to analyse the characteristics of time series and achieve accurate prediction. In 2011, Khashei M et al. applied a combined model of ARIMA and an artificial neural network to time series prediction. The results showed that the combined model had better prediction performance than the single model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In 2019, Li S et al. established a combined model of ARIMA and BPNN (ARIMA-BPNN) using coal consumption data in India. The research showed that the combined model had significantly higher prediction accuracy than the single model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Currently, a combined model based on ARIMA and ERNN (ARIMA-ERNN) is mainly applied to air pollution prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], spot price forecasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], error compensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and other fields. Nevertheless, there have been no reports in the use of the combined model to predict the epidemic trend of human brucellosis. In this study, the ARIMA-ERNN model was established based on the monthly incidence data of human brucellosis from 2007 to 2017 in Shanxi Province and compared with the ARIMA-BPNN and ARIMA models to evaluate the fitting and predictive effects of the three models. This study will provide certain theoretical support for the prevention and control of human brucellosis in Shanxi Province and offer some reference for the prediction of infectious diseases.</p>

All cases were diagnosed under the ‘2007 Diagnostic Criteria of Brucellosis (WS269-2007)’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Relevant demographic data were obtained from ‘the Statistical Yearbook of Shanxi Province’. The human brucellosis cases from January 2007 to December 2017 were assembled as monthly counts. The monthly incidence data of human brucellosis from January 2007 to December 2016 were used to build the ARIMA model. The fitted data of the ARIMA model were used as the input of neural networks and were split into two sections: a training set and a verification set. The training set data from January 2007 to December 2015 were employed to construct the neural network, and the verification set data from January 2016 to December 2016 were used to verify the neural network. The monthly incidence data from January 2017 to December 2017 were used as the test set to test the prediction performance of the three models.</p>

In this study, the monthly incidence of human brucellosis from January 2007 to December 2016 was used to build the ARIMA model, and the process included the following steps. First, the original series was smoothed with a differential method, and the Augmented Dickey-fuller (ADF) test was used to check the stationarity of the adjusted sequence. The white noise test method, also known as the Ljung-Box test, was used to determine whether the adjusted sequence was caused by random effects. If the <italic>p</italic> value was less than the significance level, the adjusted sequence was considered to be stationary and was not a random sequence. Second, the plots of the ACF and PACF of the adjusted sequence were used to provide a rough guide for reasonable models. Then, a test statistic was constructed to determine whether the residuals of candidate models were random effects, and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) was used to perform the parameter test of the candidate models. At the same time, the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Schwarz Bayesian information criterion (SBC) and the coefficient of decision (R<sup>2</sup>) were used to select the optimal model. When the AIC and SBC values of the models are relatively close, the model with the largest R<sup>2</sup> is selected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Finally, the incidence data from January 2017 to December 2017 were used to test the prediction effect of the optimal model.</p>

                <p id="Par33">ANNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] are nonlinear adaptive systems consisting of a large number of neural units. They are mainly used to establish an appropriate model by adjusting the connection weight between neurons to meet the requirements to solve practical problems. According to the different information flow directions of the neural network operation process, they can be divided into two basic forms: feedforward (static) neural networks and feedback (dynamic) neural networks. Therefore, two representative models, BPNN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and ERNN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], are respectively used in this paper to establish the combined model.</p>
                <p id="Par34">BPNN is a classic multilayer feedforward neural network based on the error backpropagation algorithm and consists of an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. The neurons in the three layers are fully connected in order, while the neurons in the same layer are not connected, and the multilayer design enables them to mine more information and perform nonlinear mapping well. The essence of BPNN learning is to minimize the MSE between predicted and actual values by adjusting the connection weight between the input layer, the hidden layer and the output layer. The learning process is divided into two parts: forward propagation of information and backward feedback of errors. The information from the input layer through the hidden layer reaches the output layer, and the predicted value is obtained. When the error between the predicted and actual values does not satisfy the requirements, the error back propagation adjusts the connection weights of each layer and iterates the process until the requirements are met. The mathematical formulas of BPNN used in this study are shown as follows.

                <p id="Par35">ERNN is a classical nonlinear local recursive network. In contrast to the feedforward neural network, the receiving layer is added to the hidden layer to achieve dynamic memory capabilities. ERNN consists of four parts: an input layer, a hidden layer, a receiving layer and an output layer. The input layer transmits signals. The hidden layer receives the input from the input layer and the feedback input of the receiving layer, and its self-joining mode has a strong sensitivity to time series data. The receiving layer stores the output value of the previous hidden layer and passes it to the current hidden layer by a one-step delay operator to achieve the purpose of dynamic memory. The output layer receives the output of the hidden layer, mainly the role of linear weighting. The learning process of ERNN is a process of learning and training sample data, obtaining dynamic characteristics between input and output parameters, and ultimately obtaining stable network parameters. In this paper, the training function is traingdx, the number of hidden layer neurons is also calculated by the above empirical formula, and other parameters are the same as the BP neural network.

The nonlinear mapping ability of ANNs can reduce the error of the ARIMA model, so artificial neural networks based on the optimal ARIMA model are constructed to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. The specific steps are as follows: First, the optimal ARIMA model was established based on the original series, the fitting value was obtained, and the error was calculated by the following formula:

Since a first-order difference and a seasonal difference were performed in building the optimal ARIMA model, the incidence data of the first 13 months were lost in this step. Second, the data from February 2008 to December 2015 were used to build the BPNN or ERNN, and the data from January 2016 to December 2016 were used to verify the neural network. The input values were the fitting values of the optimal ARIMA model and the corresponding time information, and the actual values were taken as output. In this study, to avoid unnecessary results or difficult training processes causing algorithm convergence problems, we used the mapminmax function to normalize the input and output data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Third, BPNN and ERNN continuously learned and trained the network through the input data set and the output data set, and we selected MSE as the evaluation index of network performance. When the MSE is the smallest, the corresponding BPNN and ERNN have the best fitting effect. Finally, the predicted values of the optimal ARIMA model from January 2017 to December 2017 were used as the input values of the combined model to obtain the output predicted values, and the inverse normalization method was used to restore the output predicted value of the combined models into meaningful data.</p>

The grey bars of the figure represent the same magnitude and were used to compare the sizes of each part. The original data (data), seasonal trends (seasonal), long-term trends (trend) and random effects (remainder) are shown from top to bottom. Based on the seasonal part, human brucellosis in Shanxi Province showed obvious seasonality and periodicity, with a cycle of 1 year. The trend part revealed that the incidence increased from 2007 to 2014 and decreased from 2015 to 2017. However, the seasonal decomposition plot could not determine the peak season, which we solved by using the monthplot. We found that the long-term trend of reported cases was basically consistent in the same month of each year, and the data indicated that the months from March to July were high-risk months, of which the reported cases were the highest in May (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

We also observed an upward trend from 2007 to 2014 and a significant decline from 2015 to 2016. The original series became stationary after the first-order difference and a seasonal difference, and the adjusted sequence was not a random effect (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The ARIMA model could be built at this time. Since the periodic change of the original series was 1 year, the parameters d, D and s for the ARIMA model were set to 1, 1 and 12, respectively. The possible values for P, Q, p, and q were determined according to the plot of ACF and PACF of the adjusted sequence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The residual sequence of those fitting models was a random sequence (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

              <p id="Par48">Since 2000, with the rapid development of agriculture and the animal husbandry economy in Shanxi Province, human brucellosis has become one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in Shanxi Province [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The incidence of human brucellosis in Shanxi Province showed an upward trend from 2007 to 2014 and peaked in 2014 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This may be related to the implementation of the Central Transfer Payment Brucellosis Prevention and Control Project since 2006 and the pilot project of human brucellosis prevention and treatment from 2008 to 2010. In the early stage, the persistence of risk factors for human brucellosis and increased awareness of brucellosis among residents and medical institutions led to an increase in epidemiology reporting. The incidence decreased yearly from 2015 to 2017, which may be due to the successful implementation of the above two initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par49">The analysis of seasonal characteristics (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) shows significant seasonal characteristics, mainly in the period from March to July. The main reason may be related to farming operations. In the spring, herders have close contact with livestock because of shearing. Summer is the peak season of delivery of livestock such as cattle and sheep, which greatly increases the chances of contact with pathogenic factors during this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Moreover, most human brucellosis infections occur in spring and summer, which are attributed to meteorological and temperature factors. As the temperature and relative humidity decrease in autumn and winter, the survival rate of pathogenic bacteria decreases, thereby reducing the chance of infection in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Therefore, prevention and control measures for brucellosis should consider seasonal fluctuations, and some targeted interventions should be performed at the peak of the epidemic. This suggests that we should pay special attention to protection when we are in contact with cattle, sheep and other livestock and implement active monitoring measures.</p>
              <p id="Par50">Accurate prediction of epidemic trends is of great significance for the prevention and control of human brucellosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The occurrence of brucellosis is subject to many factors, and it is difficult to collect data on influencing factors. However, the time series prediction model can overcome the shortcomings of conventional mathematical-statistical methods in the face of this situation, and all the complex external factors are attributed to the time factor to predict the future incidence. The ARIMA model is one of the most commonly used methods in infectious disease prediction and has been proven to have high accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It does not require additional variables and is more practical when the data for other influencing factors are not available. In this paper, we used the optimal model ARIMA (0, 1, 1) (0, 1, 1)<sub>12</sub> as the basic model for evaluating the performance of other models, and the results showed that the predicted value of the optimal ARIMA (0, 1, 1) (0, 1, 1)<sub>12</sub> model was essentially consistent with the actual value, but there was still a certain gap. The possible reason is that the real-time series are generally a combination of linear and nonlinear relationships. The ARIMA model can extract the linear components of the time series, but it loses the nonlinear information in the residual. An artificial neural network is an emerging technology that can imitate the learning and reasoning process of the human brain and nervous system and has a nonlinear mapping ability. In this paper, we used human brucellosis data to compare the performance of the ARIMA-BPNN, ARIMA-ERNN and ARIMA models in fitting and prediction. The study found that compared with the ARIMA model, the MAE, MSE and MAPE of the ARIMA-ERNN and ARIMA-BPNN models had different degrees of decline in terms of fitting and prediction performance. The fitting and prediction performances of the combined model were better than those of the single ARIMA model, consistent with the research results of other scholars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The combined model compensates for the lack of nonlinear mapping ability of the ARIMA model and modifies the predicted value of the ARIMA model. Compared with the ARIMA-BPNN, the MAE, MSE and MAPE of the ARIMA-ERNN model also decreased to different degrees. The ARIMA-ERNN model had the best effect in predicting the incidence of human brucellosis and was superior to the other two models. The reason may be that the BPNN regards the prediction process as static system modelling, while ERNN is based on the structure of the BPNN and uses the receiving layer to provide its function of mapping dynamic characteristics. Therefore, ERNN can better adapt to event changes and fit time series, thus achieving the highest prediction accuracy.</p>
              <p id="Par51">To the best of our knowledge, this is the only study to explore a combined model of ARIMA and ERNN for predicting the incidence of human brucellosis. Its advantage is that the ARIMA-ERNN model combines the advantages of ARIMA in linear features and a neuron network in nonlinear features and enhances the capability of a single ARIMA while retaining the advantage of its simplicity in utilizing only incidence time series data as input. Second, based on the structure of the BPNN, the ERNN adds a corresponding receiving layer in the hidden layer to provide its dynamic memory and strong sensitivity to time series, which are more suitable for analysing human brucellosis. Third, the use of the ARIMA-ERNN model contributes to rational allocation of limited public health resources and the early prevention and control of human brucellosis.</p>
              <p id="Par52">Nevertheless, there are also some limitations. First, the epidemic pattern and incidence of human brucellosis are different in different areas. Whether the ARIMA-ERNN model is suitable for other regions needs further study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Second, the incidence of human brucellosis is vulnerable to many factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This study used only monthly incidence data, which may have impacted the performance of the models. Third, only two combinatorial models are established in this study, and the superiority of the ARIMA-ERNN model and other models remains to be verified. In the future, we will incorporate the influencing factors of human brucellosis into the prediction model and compare the ARIMA-ERNN with other models.</p>
