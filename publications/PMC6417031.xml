                  <p id="Par3">The increase of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> infections in the late spring was significantly linked to temperature two weeks before, with an increase in conditional incidence of 0.175 cases per 100,000 per week for weeks 17 to 24; the relationship to temperature was not linear. Generalized structural time series model revealed that changes in temperature accounted for 33.3% of the expected cases of <italic>Campylobacteriosis</italic>, with an indication of the direction and relevant temperature range. Wavelet analysis showed a strong annual cycle with additional harmonics at four and six months. Cluster analysis showed three clusters of seasonality with geographic similarities representing metropolitan, rural, and other areas.</p>

                  <p id="Par4">The association of <italic>Campylobacteriosis</italic> with temperature is likely to be indirect. High-resolution spatial temporal linkage of weather parameters and cases is important in improving weather associations with infectious diseases. The primary driver of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> incidence remains to be determined; other avenues, such as insect contamination of chicken flocks through poor biosecurity should be explored.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par12">The distinctive seasonal pattern of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> incidence has suggested that seasonal changes in the environment contribute to this pattern. The examination of the numbers of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> in the small intestine and caeca of chicken over a 12-month period showed significant seasonal variation in the carriage rate which was associated with sunshine and temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The analysis of surveillance data from Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand found a lack of clear and consistent association with rainfall, humidity, sunshine, and temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The analysis of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> data from Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Finland, New Zealand, Scotland, and Wales showed consistent seasonal patterns of infection with more cases in the summer, but with cases peaking at different times of the year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. <italic>Campylobacter</italic> rates in England and Wales were associated with temperature, sunshine, and rainfall, with temperature being the most significant variable and a 5% increase in <italic>Campylobacter</italic> cases was associated with a 1 °C rise in temperature to a maximum temperature of 14 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">An examination of the relationship between <italic>Campylobacter</italic> cases (along with <italic>Salmonella</italic> and pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) in Canada found an increase in cases of 2.2% for every degree of increase in temperature, with a low temperature threshold of 10 °C; another Canadian study modelled <italic>Campylobacter</italic> and temperature and found an association with temperature above a threshold of 10 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. <italic>Campylobacter</italic> incidence in Massachusetts closely followed the peak in annual temperature with a lag of 2–14 days, and in Georgia (US) a strong association was found between temperature and <italic>Campylobacter</italic> infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">The impact of weather parameters on <italic>Campylobacter</italic> differed between temperate and sub-tropical areas of Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A spatial examination of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> in New Zealand found no association with climate variables. Temperature did not appear to drive the seasonality, and there was little association with rainfall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Jore et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] showed a relationship between temperature with both human infections and chicken colonisation in six European countries. There has also been work in Switzerland suggesting the seasonality of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> is partly explained by contamination of chicken broilers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">While an association with weather in general, and temperature in particular, appears to be a relatively common finding in these studies, nevertheless the link is not as clear, consistent and direct as with Salmonella; nor does it have a well-defined mechanism. Nichols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Ekdahl et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] suggested that flies might explain the epidemiology of <italic>Campylobacter</italic>, through the direct transfer of contaminated material from raw meats or faeces to ready-to-eat foods, and/or by the seasonal contamination of chicken flocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Nichols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] proposed a fly transmission model that explained the seasonal distribution by the impact of temperature on non-biting fly numbers, as measured by the development time of <italic>Musca domestica</italic> larvae. Evidence suggested that the use of fly screens on chicken production houses could reduce the seasonal contamination of chickens and subsequent human disease significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Similar responses to temperature in both chicken broiler carcase contaminations with <italic>Campylobacter</italic> and human infections with <italic>Campylobacter</italic> cases in six different European Countries, implying that the seasonal relationship between human infection and temperature is more likely a result of exposure to chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">One of the additional complicating factors in the <italic>Campylobacter</italic> transmission in most developed countries is the significant percentage of cases related to foreign travel, and the seasonality of this additional factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Hartnack et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] highlighted the necessity of quantifying the transmission of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> from broiler to humans and to include climatic factors in order to gain further insight in its epidemiology. Sterk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] used a runoff simulator to analyse the effect of climate change on <italic>Campylobacter</italic> (along with <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>) runoff and human infection risks in the Netherlands; and found that climate change has little overall impact on runoff of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> (along with <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>) from land to the surface waters.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Within climate change research, there are three reasons for undertaking this work. Firstly to demonstrate evidence of the potential short-term consequences on human health from climate change; secondly to understand what factors influence the occurrence of infectious diseases; and thirdly to provide models which can forecast future disease risks. The incidence of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> in the UK demonstrated both a strong and regular seasonality, and a variation in the number of cases per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This raises a question of whether the seasonal patterns of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> have changed over time as a result of climate change and other environmental factors.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par18"><italic>Campylobacter</italic> surveillance data were extracted from the Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) database of Public Health England from 1989 to 2014. A case was defined as a human faecal sample submitted from a patient that was positive for <italic>Campylobacter</italic>. All <italic>Campylobacter</italic> surveillance data were laboratory-confirmed cases and were predominantly based on the isolation of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> from faeces using selective culture media in a micro aerobic environment; membrane filter, PCR or other approaches made up a very small percentage of cases. A few sentinel laboratory sites conducted screening using a range of PCR targets during the 2012 Olympic Games. Standard antimicrobial testing methods, used in primary diagnostic laboratories, were predominantly disc diffusion methods. Where speciation was reported, it was conducted in diagnostic laboratories using conventional phenotypic methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Most cases were thought to be symptomatic and included patients with extra intestinal infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The symptoms were those recorded on the physician request form and generally are in the simplistic form of “D &amp; V” or something equivalent.</p>
              <p id="Par19">The meteorological data were supplied by the Met Office and held on the Medical and Environmental Data a Mash-up Infrastructure (MEDMI) platform (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.data-mashup.org.uk">https://www.data-mashup.org.uk</ext-link>).</p>
              <p id="Par20">Reported cases between 2005 and 2009 were linked to local weather parameters at the laboratory postcode locations; namely: maximum, minimum and average daily temperature and daily rainfall in 30 days before the specimen date using a previously published approach that prevented patient identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The linkage was conducted on laboratory postcode because this was more complete than patient residential postcode and preserved patient confidentiality. An additional study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] validated that the weather parameters at the laboratory postcode correlate well with the weather at the domestic postcode of cases.</p>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Comparative conditional incidence</title>
                <p id="Par21">GIS analysis was performed on cases with Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOA) using ArcGIS 10.2 for Desktop by ESRI. A map of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> incidence between 2005 and 2009 from patient’s residential postcode data was produced. Some areas had poor residential postcode completeness resulting in areas with an apparent lower incidence. Comparative conditional incidence <bold>(</bold>CCI) is a new approach which uses cases and LSOA populations to examine differences between disease incidence at different temperature and rainfall in the 30 days before the specimen date within equal sized datasets. CCI is a sum of cases per week within all LSOAs with same temperature divided by sum of population in the same LSOAs. It is conditional as the weather variables were available for the weeks and LSOAs where there were positive cases and excluded patients without a residential postcode as it was not possible to establish the LSOA.</p>

                <title>Wavelet analysis</title>
                <p id="Par22">To detect potential time-varying seasonality in <italic>Campylobacter</italic> that might result from <italic>Salmonella</italic> control measures in chicken production, such as improved biosecurity practices, we used wavelet analysis. <italic>Campylobacter</italic> daily counts between 1989 and 2009 were adjusted from the day of the year using a seven-day moving average and systematic adjustments for the reduced reporting over bank holidays and for long-term trends as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The analyses were conducted in R using ‘waveletComp’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par23"><italic>Campylobacter</italic> cases across ten geographical regions in England and Wales were examined using the generalized structural time series model (GEST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] with a negative binomial distribution, where the natural logarithm of the expected cases of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> was decomposed into baseline, trend and seasonal components. To investigate the effect of weather variables on the development of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> cases, explanatory variables of the average temperature (°C) and the total rainfall (mm), of one, two, three and four weeks before diagnosis were included in the model. The temperature variable was examined using fixed and varying-coefficient analyses in order to account for variations in the relationship through the year.</p>

              <p id="Par25">Incidence was determined from patient residence postcode data (2005–2014) and plotted by LSOA across England and Wales. The geographic representation of cases per 100,000 per week showed areas of the country with an apparently low incidence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a; shown in blue); this is presumed to be where residential postcode data were missing and/or there were under-reporting. Data on individual years of cases showed a gradual improvement in the completeness of reporting from 2005 to 2014 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Incidence. <bold>a</bold> Average <italic>Campylobacter</italic> cases per 100,000 population for the 10 years 2005 to 2014 by Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) in England and Wales; <bold>b</bold>

              <p id="Par26">The CCI was estimated using datasets that split cases into ten equal parts by temperature and rainfall. The highest CCI values were found for the minimum temperature (9 °C) two weeks before the specimen date, average temperature (16 °C) two weeks before the specimen date and maximum temperature (21 °C) two weeks before the specimen date (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). The cases at the height of summer when temperatures were highest had lower cases than a few weeks earlier. Between average temperatures of 5 °C and 15 °C, there was a 0.09 case increase in the incidence per 100,000 per week (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). It is unclear how this relates to the actual incidence as the LSOA per weeks that did not have a <italic>Campylobacter</italic> case which could not be included. Using four week periods, average temperatures two weeks before and splitting the data for each time period into two equal halves by temperature, demonstrated that the relationship between temperature and incidence in each time period differed, forming a cyclic loop (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). For weeks 17 to 20 and 21 to 24 there was an increase in the CCI of 0.175 cases per 100,000 per week for each degree increase in the temperature two weeks before (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). A similar approach using average rainfall over the previous four weeks showed no consistent links with the CCI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f). Adjusting the number of data points to give larger or smaller percentages of the data in each point affected the R<sup>2</sup> value of the CCI on all data, with optimum results for 200 data points or less (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par33">The epidemiology of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> in humans remains a subject of importance because it is the commonest bacterial cause of diarrhoea in most developed countries, and because intervention requires an understanding of disease transmission pathways and possible association with climate and other environmental change. Within the context of climate change research, the approaches to linking weather parameters with infectious disease data commonly rely on an assumption that the relationships are continuous throughout the year, sometimes assuming a threshold value above which the continuous relationship changes. Here, we used different methods to demonstrate that <italic>Campylobacter</italic> incidence changes dynamically through the season, and we were able to decouple the relationship of temperature from the seasonality. Most notable was the very steep increase in the number of cases diagnosed between weeks 19 and 24, although there was still a relationship to temperature before this (weeks 1-18) as well as later in the year (weeks 29-53). The distribution was also consistent with the direct and/or indirect fly transmission hypotheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], with the fly populations increasing during the late spring period resulting in transmission passing from faeces or other contaminated material to either food and/or chicken flocks (as a result of poor biosecurity). The expression of weekly incidence by the temperature during that week in an LSOA and averaged for all weeks with one or more <italic>Campylobacter</italic> cases, gives a means of examining the relationship between case numbers and temperature that is partially decoupled from seasonality and geography.</p>
              <p id="Par34">The GEST provides a useful approach for modelling over-dispersed counts with a negative binomial distribution. It allows for the extraction of hidden trend and seasonality and estimating the effect of weather parameters. The use of multilevel factors for temperature separated into 13 four week periods allowed the contribution of temperature two weeks prior to the diagnosis to be estimated, explaining that 33.3% of the contribution to the annual burden of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> (calculated as relative change in the predictive mean) was attributable to temperature, compared to 7.7% using a single coefficient value. The remaining regular seasonality across the five years was small, and was limited to holiday periods, perhaps reflecting surveillance bias. The contribution of rainfall to the incidence of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> was small. While being able to predict cases from the temperature in a much more complete way than the GEST model with a fixed coefficient, the GEST with the varying coefficient model did not provide an explanation of the causes of these changes, and suggested that other drivers linked to temperature were important.</p>
              <p id="Par35">When the GEST model was applied to weekly number of cases of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> from 1989 to 2009 in thirty three Strategic Health Authorities, it allowed the fitted seasonality to be used to group sub-regional SHAs into three geographical clusters.</p>
              <p id="Par36">The distribution of cases across geographically distinct sub-regions demonstrated strong differences in the strength of the seasonal pattern, but not the week when cases increase. The seasonality was strongest in Wales and the North East, and weakest and a bit more delayed in the large urban areas of London and Birmingham, with other geographic areas distributed in between. This implies that there are local factors that also influence <italic>Campylobacter</italic> disease occurrence. These could be demographic (e.g. more young people in cities), different risk profiles (e.g. more exposure to manures in the countryside; greater foreign travel in cities), and/or different impacts of weather locally (e.g. fly populations causing direct transmission to food or indirect transmission through the contamination of chicken flocks especially in rural areas) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par37">Wavelet analysis showed that <italic>Campylobacter</italic> cases could be interpreted as the super-imposition of three main harmonics of annual, semi-annual and 4-months periods. The origin of these harmonics is not clear; however, annual and higher order (1/2 year, 1/3 year, etc.) harmonics, whose relative importance depends on the geographic region, are typical features of a range of climatic variables. Potential other drivers could be other environmental variables, reporting bias, human behaviour, and/or intrinsic seasonal patterns in animal/vector reservoirs (i.e. the contamination of chickens needs to be investigated). In this type of study the quality of data is important. We used laboratory postcode as a surrogate for patient residence postcode to anonymise the data and improve data completeness in linking cases to weather parameters in 30 days before the specimen date. Djennad et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] demonstrated that it is valid to use laboratory postcode as a proxy for patient postcode. The algorithm to locally link case and weather was limited to a five-year period, for three temperature parameters and one rainfall parameter and had a lag of 30 days. Another limitation is that the data linkage was in cases only, with the result that weeks without cases were not recorded.</p>
              <p id="Par38">Being able to link cases to an LSOA allows the CCI to be applied to compare incidence using a range of weather parameters. This method utilised the geographic variation in weather parameters by combining data from small areas and their populations that had the same weather conditions. The CCI is limited by the weather data only being linked to cases only and not to the underlying population. While the approach provides a useful way of examining weather variables that are de-coupled from seasonality by grouping cases per week and their underlying populations at a particular temperature or rainfall level together as a combined incidence, it is clear that some weeks and areas will be left out because there are no <italic>Campylobacter</italic> cases. It would be expected that a measurement of the true incidence would give a result that differed somewhat from the CCI because the true incidence would include all the weeks with negative results not just those with positive ones. An extended version of this that uses weather parameters for both cases and populations has the potential to provide a more robust representation of the incidence of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> at different temperatures through the year.</p>
              <p id="Par39">The CCI and GEST approaches gave good results in examining environmental drivers for <italic>Campylobacter</italic>. Adding other weather parameters to these models should further improve the predictive power of these models or methods. As an example, the development of standard weather database and algorithms through the MEDMI project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.data-mashup.org.uk">https://www.data-mashup.org.uk</ext-link>) facilitates data linkage of environment and health data such that different analyses may be examined in a more systematic way for a wider range of infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The PHE <italic>Campylobacter</italic> dataset is sufficiently large, nevertheless the epidemiology of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> remains enigmatic and interventions have had limited success to date. It is therefore an important organism to study to elucidate methodologies that have power and utility in explaining infectious disease and climate change epidemiology for other infectious diseases in the future.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par40">The study provides strong association between <italic>Campylobacter</italic> and temperature. Using a range of statistical methods, the study suggests that temperature and/or rainfall alone cannot explain the entire seasonal variation of <italic>Campylobacteriosis</italic> risk in England and Wales. Further research should investigate if the temporal dependency of the relationship between <italic>Campylobacter</italic> incidence and temperature on the week might be driven by other environmental variables, or perhaps by an intrinsic seasonality in the dynamics of the bacterial population in the environment or in the zoonotic reservoir or potential vectors such as flies.</p>
