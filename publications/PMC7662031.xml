                <p id="Par1">COVID-19 is a global pandemic declared by WHO. This pandemic requires the execution of planned control strategies, incorporating quarantine, self-isolation, and tracing of asymptomatic cases. Mathematical modeling is one of the prominent techniques for predicting and controlling the spread of COVID-19. The predictions of earlier proposed epidemiological models (e.g. SIR, SEIR, SIRD, SEIRD, etc.) are not much accurate due to lack of consideration for transmission of the epidemic during the latent period. Moreover, it is important to classify infected individuals to control this pandemic. Therefore, a new mathematical model is proposed to incorporate infected individuals based on whether they have symptoms or not. This model forecasts the number of cases more accurately, which may help in better planning of control strategies. The model consists of eight compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), asymptomatic (A), quarantined (Q), recovered (R), deaths (D), and insusceptible (T), accumulatively named as SEIAQRDT. This model is employed to predict the pandemic results for India and its majorly affected states. The estimated number of cases using the SEIAQRDT model is compared with SIRD, SEIR, and LSTM models. The relative error square analysis is used to verify the accuracy of the proposed model. The simulation is done on real datasets and results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. These results may help the government and individuals to make the planning in this pandemic situation.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Many times, in the past, human pandemics and epidemics have destroyed humankind, usually, these pandemics have made many changes in the living of humankind. Similarly, due to the novel coronavirus, the whole world is again facing the deadly experience which affects human lives the most [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. WHO declared the COVID-19 as an international pandemic on March 11, 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. According to WHO, the continuing pandemic of novel coronavirus has asserted 5,31,806 deaths and 11,301,850 confirmed cases in the world, as of July 6, 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In India, 7,00,728 confirmed cases, and 19,721 deaths have been reported till July 6, 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The government of India also accepted it as pandemic and imposed a nation-wide lockdown on March 23, 2020. Almost the entire nation has been locked down and different preventative measures, like sanitization of containment zones, identifying close contacts, quarantining infected individuals, encouraging social consensus on individual-protection such as wearing a face-mask, using hand-sanitizer, and washing hands regularly, etc. have been employed. Although, the cases of novel coronavirus are continuing and the number of daily confirmed cases is making a new record.</p>
              <p id="Par3">COVID-19 has been showing unusual characteristics in comparison to earlier coronavirus (i.e., the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A considerable number of transmissions of COVID-19 is observed via human-to-human contact with individuals having no symptoms or the mild symptom of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The Immense viral capacity of SARS-Cov-2 was observed within the upper respiratory system of patients with mild symptoms or without symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, the subclinical infection may play an important part in maintaining the epidemic. Mathematical modeling is one of the prominent techniques for predicting and controlling the spread of coronavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The popular SIR model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] characterized the spread of infection using susceptible, infected, and removed compartments. Generally, new factors are incorporated in the SIR model to obtain more relevant information is a common practice. Therefore, several mathematical models have been introduced by improving the SIR model to capture the dynamics of COVID-19. Lin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] developed a conceptual SEIR model which includes factors like individual reaction and government activity. Giordano et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] developed the SIDARTHE model which incorporates undetected and detected infected individuals. Prem et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] studied the impact of control strategies through the SEIR model. Peng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] developed a generalized SEIR model that covered the transmission of COVID-19 in the latent period. The novel coronavirus tends to transmit from human-to-human within the latent period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Till today, no proper vaccine or treatment is available for the disease. Hence, the best way to control the spread of the pandemic is the prediction of the number of infected cases that benefit the authorities in better planning of control strategies. Commonly used models like SIR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], SEIR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and SEIJR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] are not appropriate to predict the impact of the epidemic because they include a limited number of factors and ignored some important factors like asymptomatic cases, quarantined cases, etc. Moreover, recurrent neural networks (RNN), such as long-short term memory (LSTM), models are generally focused on the number of infectious. The main drawback of the LSTM based models is that these models do not consider the effect of quarantined cases, asymptomatic cases, protected population, etc. Therefore, it motivates us to propose a model that includes the ignored factors to estimate the number of infected cases accurately. The high number of asymptomatic cases have been reported in India. So, it is important to incorporate asymptomatic cases in the mathematical model. In this paper, we proposed a new mathematical model (SEIAQRDT) by extending the generalized SEIR model given by Peng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] for India and its highly affected states. The proposed eight compartmental model incorporates factors such as susceptible, exposed, infected, asymptomatic, quarantined, recovered, dead, and insusceptible. In this model, asymptomatic and symptomatic patients are treated differently. The nation-wide lockdown and compulsion on wearing of face-mask to get an accurate prediction are also considered. The simulation results offered by the proposed model are very close to the actual data as compared to other models. This paper divided into 5 sections. Section <xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec">1</xref> gives an introduction. A brief overview of the related works is given in Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref>. In Section <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref>, we discuss the newly proposed mathematical model and its parameter values. In Section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref>, the simulation results and discussion for India and its majorly affected states are presented. The performance of the proposed model is compared with three different models (SIRD, SEIR, and LSTM models) for different countries. Section <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">5</xref> gives the conclusion and possible future works.</p>

              <title>Literature Review</title>
              <p id="Par4">In this section, currently available epidemiological models for prediction of coronavirus (COVID-19) are briefly discussed. These models help to estimate the number of COVID-19 patients. Some of the popular mathematical models (e.g. SIR, SEIR, SEIJR, SEIAR, and SEIRD) are widely used to estimate the future outbreak of communicable diseases.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Zareie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] applied the SIR model to the prediction of coronavirus spread in Iran based on China parameters. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] proposed the SEIR model which illustrates the relation among susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered individuals. It is the widely used model that predicted the outbreak of coronavirus in China as well as in other countries. Fan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], Geng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and Zhou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] used this model for the prediction of the outbreak of the coronavirus in China. This model accepts a limited amount of actual data and offers a correct prediction for the small period but the prediction for a long period is not much accurate. Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] proposed the modified SEIR model by introducing the two new parameters move-in and move-out for the inflow and outflow of susceptible individuals respectively. The basic structure of the different compartmental models for the prediction of infected cases is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Lin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] discussed the conceptual SEIR model by incorporating the factors government action and public perception. Read et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] proposed the extended version of the SEIR model.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>4 different compartmental models for the prediction of the total number of infected cases</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10489_2020_1929_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par6">It includes one more factor asymptomatic individual during the incubation period in the SEIR model. It precisely segregates an isolated individual from the other populations. However, it is difficult to collect precise data for individuals which makes it difficult to get the best-fit parameters. Hence, the long-term forecasting is distant from the real data. The major difference between the SEIJR and the SEIAR is that isolated individuals are replaced with asymptomatic individuals. Bai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] applied this model and show similar properties to the SEIJR model. Additionally, this model deals with the zoonotic force of pneumonia and daily new infected cases. This model is applied by Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and its simulation is very accurate to pandemic’s actual data at the starting stage.</p>
              <p id="Par7">The models discussed above have their specific properties. However, no one is perfect for long-range forecasting because of the number of parameters and model accuracy. Therefore, one more parameter i.e. the dead individual has been introduced by Huang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] in the SEIAR model to improve the accuracy of the model for long-term prediction. They also include two new factors, i.e., time of isolation initiation and intensity of isolation that the government has taken. The accuracy of this model is also better than the previously discussed models. Some artificial intelligence models are also applied to estimate the number of infected cases of coronavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Pathan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] applied the recurrent neural network-based LSTM model to predict the time-series of COVID-19 through mutation rate analysis. Kirbas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] predicted the total number of cases of Denmark, Belgium, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Finland, Switzerland, and Turkey with the help of the LSTM model. Jana et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] studied the COVID-19 dynamics transmission for the USA and Italy with the help of the convolution LSTM model. Arora et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] applied deep LSTM, convolutional LSTM, and Bi-directional LSTM to predict the confirmed cases for India and performed the comparative analysis for these models. LSTM models are generally focused on the number of infectious. The main drawback of the LSTM based models is that these models do not consider the effect of quarantined cases, asymptomatic cases, protected population, etc. These factors are essential to study the impact of COVID-19.</p>

                <title>Basic Reproduction Number</title>
                <p id="Par13">The reproduction number is one of the prominent states in the investigation of contagious disease. It helps in deciding that the diseases disappear or it will continue with the time. Generally, it is illustrated by <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>, which provides the number of secondary cases. The Original infectious person can transmit disease in a population where each individual is susceptible. If <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> &gt; 1 disease will remain in the population and if <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> &lt; 1 disease is under control and it will die out. Therefore, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need to plan an effective strategy to make the reproduction number smaller than one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par14">For system (1), a disease-free equilibrium point exists which is denoted by <italic>e</italic><sub>0</sub>. Where <italic>S</italic> = <italic>N</italic> (1 − <italic>α</italic>) <italic>and E</italic> = <italic>I</italic> = <italic>A</italic> = <italic>Q</italic> = <italic>R</italic> = <italic>D</italic> = 0. As <italic>α</italic> is the protection rate through which people are protected and therefore the susceptible population is calculated as <italic>S</italic> = <italic>N</italic>(1 − <italic>α</italic>). Thus, <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> is computed mathematically, and to calculate the reproduction number, we employ the next generation matrix method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The reproduction number for the proposed system is calculated using equation <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> = <italic>ρ</italic>(<italic>FV</italic><sup>−1</sup>), where <italic>ρ</italic> represents the spectral radius of the matrix <italic>FV</italic><sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

                <p id="Par21">The model fitting of cumulative cases in India reported till July 03, 2020 shows a satisfactory estimation. The model also shows the fitting of recovered and death cases. The number of quarantined cases is also considered as active cases. The total active cases are the sum-up of quarantined, hospitalized, and self-isolation cases which are also fitted in our model. In addition to quarantined cases, asymptomatic cases are also incorporated. The data for fitting is examined from the second week of March. The evolution of the total number of cases, deaths, recovered and quarantined cases have been tracked very closely with the data up to July 03, 2020. The model predicts the peak of the daily number of cases in the first or second week of September with an estimation error may be less than 5%. The recent situation includes protective measures like nation-wide lockdown, wearing of face-mask, and identification of containment zones. Hence, it is observed that the number of cases is much higher if these restrictions were not imposed. Around 2.4 million cumulative cases are approximated till the second last week of August whereas 1.85 million people will be recovered from COVID-19 and around 0.06 million deaths are estimated in India by the second last week of August. The number of asymptomatic cases is approximated around 0.09 million based on the assumption that the probability of transmission of asymptomatic infectious is lower than symptomatic patients, whereas the recovery rate is assumed the same for both the cases. In the proposed model, recovery rate and mortality rate for India and its states are given as follows.<disp-formula id="Equi"><alternatives><tex-math id="M23">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The SEIAQRDT model is compared with SIRD, SEIR, and LSTM models for different country’s data. The LSTM models are mainly focused on the number of infectious. The main drawback of the LSTM based models is that these models do not consider the effect of quarantined cases and asymptomatic cases. In all the cases, simulation results show that the SEIAQRDT model fits the data better than the other models. The reason for this superiority is that the SEIAQRDT model takes suspected, infected with and without symptoms, recovered, quarantined, death, and exposed cases, whereas SIRD and SEIR model considered only four factors.<fig id="Fig21"><label>Fig. 21</label><caption><p>Comparison between the real infected cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], estimated infected cases with the SEIAQRDT model and estimated infected cases with the LSTM model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] for India</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10489_2020_1929_Fig21_HTML" id="MO21"/></fig></p>

              <p id="Par47">The COVID-19 epidemic is exerting an unusual weight on social life in many countries, including India. Although nation-wide lockdown and other preventive majors are imposed in India still the number of cases is getting increased. In this study, we proposed the SEIAQRDT model including asymptomatic cases for the prediction of COVID-19 disease. The real data for total cumulative cases, daily infected cases, total recovered, total deaths, and total quarantined individuals have been incorporated. The numerical simulations are presented for India and four major states (Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Delhi). The estimated number of cases using the SEIAQRDT model has been compared with SIRD, SEIR, and LSTM models. The estimated data with SEIARQDT model is very near to actual data. The relative error square analysis is used to verify the accuracy of the proposed model. The proposed model has average relative error of 0.86% (3.99% with SIRD) and 1.36% (7.15% with SEIR) for China, 0.69% (3.59% with LSTM) for India and 0.77% (4.42% with LSTM) for Canada. The average relative error for SEIAQRDT model with a higher number of factors is very less in comparison to the average relative error for the other models. These results may help to recognize the impact of coronavirus and to prevent the spread of the virus on a large scale. In the future, the proposed model can be extended by introducing additional factors like environmental transmission, effect of vaccines, treatment strategies, effect of delay, impact of unlocking, etc. Moreover, the fractional-order derivative can also be applied in the present model.</p>
