              <abstract>
                <p>We apply Bayesian inference methods to a suite of distinct compartmental models of generalised SEIR type, in which diagnosis and quarantine are included via extra compartments. We investigate the evidence for a change in lethality of COVID-19 in late autumn 2020 in the UK, using age-structured, weekly national aggregate data for cases and mortalities. Models that allow a (step-like or graded) change in infection fatality rate (IFR) have consistently higher model evidence than those without. Moreover, they all infer a close to two-fold increase in IFR. This value lies well above most previously available estimates. However, the same models consistently infer that, most probably, the increase in IFR <italic toggle="yes">preceded</italic> the time window during which variant B.1.1.7 (alpha) became the dominant strain in the UK. Therefore, according to our models, the caseload and mortality data do not offer unequivocal evidence for higher lethality <italic toggle="yes">of a new variant</italic>. We compare these results for the UK with similar models for Germany and France, which also show increases in inferred IFR during the same period, despite the even later arrival of new variants in those countries. We argue that while the new variant(s) may be one contributing cause of a large increase in IFR in the UK in autumn 2020, other factors, such as seasonality, or pressure on health services, are likely to also have contributed.</p>

              <title>1 Introduction</title>
              <p>The alpha variant B.1.1.7 of the SARS-CoV-2 virus first emerged in the UK in September 2020. It is now well known to be more infectious than the prior UK strain and for this reason, in the following months, it not only became dominant in the UK itself, but rapidly took hold in a number of other countries (including the USA) where it soon became the dominant variant [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, it is less certain whether B.1.1.7 also led to more severe cases of COVID-19, resulting in turn in a higher fatality rate [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258968.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This question has prompted the search for anomalies in the relation between aggregated case and mortality numbers. Simple visual inspections of these data, accounting for the typical time lag between cases and mortality, have suggested that infections with SARS-CoV-2 became more lethal in late 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>However, the relation between reported cases and mortalities is not always straightforward to interpret. The time between infection and potential deaths is stochastic, so that a time series of mortality data will tend to show less rapid changes than corresponding case numbers. Moreover, as the available testing capacity changes with time alongside the demand for tests, which leads to a time-dependent ascertainment rate. Hence, reported case numbers are not directly representative for the true number of cases.</p>
              <p>In order to overcome these challenges while still focusing on (nationally) aggregated data for cases and mortalities, we choose to analyse such data in the context of well-mixed compartmented models, whose complexity is adjustable for this purpose [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258968.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These models take into account not only the stochastic dynamics of infection and progression of the disease, but also the process though which individuals get diagnosed. The latter is informed by the reported overall rate of tests performed, implicitly leading to an improving ascertainment rate if the supply of tests rises faster than the number of cases.</p>
              <p>Our goal is to establish the evidence for a change in the UK lethality of COVID-19 in a Bayesian fashion, using the reported age-structured data for nationwide cases and mortality. For that purpose, we compare different models that either do or do not allow for a change in the infection fatality rate (IFR). We analyse differences in their posterior probability, optimised for fixed data over a set of model parameters. Generally, one would expect that the likelihood of a model increases as more details are added. In order to judge the significance of changes in the posterior, we compare a whole set of model variants differing in the level of detail, and see whether the ones that do allow for changing IFR perform better than those that do not.</p>
              <p>Our comparison also includes model variants that would explain perceived changes in the case fatality rate merely through changes in the ascertainment rate. However, these models require implausible assumptions about changes in the testing strategy.</p>
              <p>The model specification, simulation, likelihood computation, and optimisation is carried out using the software package PyRoss, which we have developed during the past year [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>

                <p>We consider a suite of compartmented models (referred to as model variants below) all with <italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 7 age groups, and 14 classes, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0258968.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. These classes are abbreviated as S, E, A, Ia, Is1, Is2, Im, R; along with diagnosed/quarantined versions of all compartments (except S and E), labeled as AQ, IaQ, etc. The age groups are 0–14, 15–29, 30–44, 45–64, 65–74, 75–84, and 85+ (for our UK model variants), referred to by running indices <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">j</italic>. The transitions from the susceptible (S) to the exposed (E) compartment are induced by infected individuals in the compartments activated (A), asymptomatic (Ia), and the two symptomatic infected stages (Is1, Is2). The corresponding infection rate reads

Here, X stands for any of the compartments S, E, A, Ia, Is1, Is2, Im, R, and the sum runs over these. Assuming perfect tests, which, however, do not detect the exposed stage, we use the false positive rate <italic toggle="yes">ϕ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">X</italic></sub> = 0 for X being S, E, or R, otherwise the true positive rate <italic toggle="yes">ϕ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">X</italic></sub> = 1.

The only fit parameter we infer is <italic toggle="yes">π</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub>, the priority for testing individuals that are not symptomatically infected (i.e. of classes S, E, A, Ia, R, setting <italic toggle="yes">π</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">S</italic></sub> = <italic toggle="yes">π</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">E</italic></sub> = <italic toggle="yes">π</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">A</italic></sub> = <italic toggle="yes">π</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">Ia</italic></sub> = <italic toggle="yes">π</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">R</italic></sub> ≡ <italic toggle="yes">π</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub>). It interpolates between random testing for <italic toggle="yes">π</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub> = 1 and very targeted testing for <italic toggle="yes">π</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub> = 0. The progression through stages in the quarantined compartments is the same as in the non-quarantined ones, but quarantined individuals cause no further infections (effectively assuming perfect self-isolation). Once tested positive, individuals remain in the quarantined compartments. The recovered class RQ therefore includes individuals that have actually left quarantine, but we keep this class separate for the purpose of counting previously diagnosed cases.</p>
                <p>In summary, our model implicitly accounts for changes in the ascertainment rate, in a way that is informed by the supply (the total number of tests) and the demand (the yet untested symptomatic cases).</p>

                <p>All transitions are modeled as Markov rates, i.e. they are inherently stochastic. In order to account for additional sources of noise or variation that are not present in the well-mixed model, we infer overdispersion parameters that scale up the fluctuations in transitions related to infections, testing, and deaths.</p>

                <p>We consider the reported cumulative case numbers as the sum of all quarantined classes for each age cohort. The reported cumulative mortalities are identified with the numbers of class ImQ (where the age groups 15–29 and 30–44 to match the available data). We ensure that no deaths remain unnoticed, by formally assuming that individuals in class Im continue to get tested at high priority. The numbers in all other compartments are considered as hidden, and are implicitly reconstructed by the inference procedure.</p>

                <p>We use weekly data from the week beginning 2020–03-07 to the week ending 2021–01-15. For cases, we use the daily numbers reported on the UK government webpage [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], reported by specimen date and in 5-year cohorts. We coarse-grain these data to weekly numbers and to our choice of age groups.</p>
                <p>Death numbers by week of reporting have been obtained from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) webpage [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These data appear to be incomplete after 2020–12-25 and have therefore been padded with mortality data from the government webpage, which are more up-to-date but not age-structured. For the weeks in question, the sum over all age groups in class ImQ is considered as observable. (More recent data have become available in the meantime, however, we stick to this procedure to ensure comparability between results for the model variants.)</p>
                <p>The daily number of PCR tests performed is available from the government webpage [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

              <title>4 Model comparison</title>
              <p>Using our software package PyRoss, we can calculate the logarithmic likelihood of the observed data for each of the model variants and for any choice of the model parameters and initial conditions [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This computation is based on the inherent stochasticity specified for the model. It employs a multivariate Gaussian approximation of the joint probability of all compartment values at all observed points in time, thus taking into account all correlations across compartments and time. The approximation becomes exact in the limit of large population sizes (provided that the data is sufficiently close to the mean) and is therefore appropriate for our well-mixed models applied at national level.</p>
              <p>Given an informed choice of prior distributions for all parameters and initial conditions, we have determined for each model variant the parameters that maximise the posterior probability (MAP). To decide between different modelling hypotheses, a rigorous approach is to compute the model evidence (also known as the marginal likelihood). In this Section we take the simpler approach of comparing the log-posterior probabilities—to a first approximation, models with large posterior probability should be preferred. However, that approach can suffer from over-fitting: that issue can be addressed via estimates of the evidence. This point is addressed in Sec 5, below. (Anticipating the answer, we find that the conclusions of this Section—based on the log-posterior—are robust.)</p>
              <p>Results are summarised in <xref rid="pone.0258968.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0258968.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. Remarkably, the model variants with a change in IFR consistently attain higher (non-normalised) posteriors. As we have centred the prior for the factor of change in IFR to the value 1 (representing the null-hypothesis that there has been no change), the prior always decreases with a change in IFR, but this reduction of the prior is overbalanced by quite some margin by the increased likelihood derived from data. The inferred change in IFR is always around the factor of two for the UK data. Note that for model A2 the change in the r
ecovery rate amounts even to a factor of 2.35 in IFR for the oldest cohort.</p>

                    <p>We list the country considered along with the model variant, the number of inferred parameters and initial conditions, the logarithmic prior, posterior, and model evidence, and, if applicable, the inferred onset time and factor of a change in IFR. For Type 0 models without any IFR change (printed in bold), absolute values of log-prior, log-posterior (non-normalised), and the logarithmic model evidence are shown, indicated by “abs”. For other models, we show values relative to the corresponding base model, indicated by Δ. The indicated uncertainties in the inferred parameters for the IFR change correspond to a single standard deviation in a Gaussian approximation of the posterior.</p>

              <p>It is remarkable that even though the models A0, B0, C0, and BC0 have different numbers of fit parameters, their variation in the log-posterior is nowhere near as big as the difference to the variants with a changing IFR. This observation already suggests that the increase in likelihood for the variants with changing IFR is not a mere consequence of overfitting due to the additional parameters.</p>
              <p>For each model and set of MAP parameters, we can plot a deterministic solution. This is the most likely trajectory, conditional on the inferred initial condition, and the mean of the multivariate Gaussian approximation for all compartment values at all times. Fully detailed plots of the MAP trajectories for each of the model variants are shown in part C in <xref rid="pone.0258968.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>.</p>
              <p>Unsurprisingly, the results for the most detailed model variants BC0 and BC1 produce mean trajectories for cases and mortalities that fit the data best, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0258968.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>. Among these two solutions, the even better fit of the model variant with change in IFR (BC1) is not only evident through the likelihood computation, but also visible to the naked eye.</p>

              <p>In <xref rid="pone.0258968.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> we show the MAP trajectories for the variants of models A, B and C. On visual inspection, none of these models fit the data as accurately as BC0 and BC1 in <xref rid="pone.0258968.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>. However, such visual inspection is not always as reliable an estimate as our Bayesian posterior, which accounts for temporal correlations in the data. For example, we find that the likelihood strongly penalises models where the rate of growth (or decay) of infections does not match the data. Also, the (idealised) step-changes in the intervention function <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) mean that MAP trajectories may over/under-shoot the data at the change points. In combination, these two factors mean that agreement between expected trajectory and data may be imperfect on visual inspection; however, the posterior is being correctly maximised and the results of inference are robust. This is because deviations of the data from the mean trajectory are consistently taken into account for the implicit inference of unobserved compartments. For example, the inferred change in IFR is remarkably consistent between the model variants for the UK, despite considerable differences in the mean trajectory for each model. This observation reassures us that the evidence for a change in IFR would persist in a model that is even more detailed than model BC.</p>

              </fig>
              <p>Some differences between models A/B and C are due to a generic feature of our computation of the likelihood. When the estimated overdispersion parameters are too low to account for the observed noise in the data, the optimiser tends to overestimate the expected case and deaths numbers, thereby increasing the variance of weekly changes. Considering the resulting MAP trajectories for models A and B, it seems that the inferred overdispersion parameters, which serve well to fit the first wave, are too small to match the level of noise in the second wave. This leads to an overestimation of both expected case and death numbers. Differences between cases and deaths in this overestimation could negate the perceived change in IFR. This has prompted us to analyse model C, allowing for changes in the overdispersion parameters for the second wave. It is consistent with the results of models A and B, which rules out that the observed changes in the IFR stem from temporal changes in the overdispersion.</p>
              <p>The models C0/C1 reproduce the observed height of the second wave, but not the dip between the second and third wave. Note that model C (just like model A) has the November lockdown fixed without easing, leading to a larger reduction in cases and deaths than in reality. Model BC (easing and change of overdispersion) reproduces the short-livedness of this reduction better.</p>
              <p>The sudden drop in mortalities (individuals with COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate) in late August / early September is not reproduced by any of our models. This might be related to changes in the legal definition of such deaths. We do not model this here, but note that adjusting the data for a lasting change in the definition from this time onwards would likely lead to an even larger increase in the IFR than the MAP estimates 1.9–2.2 reported above.</p>
              <p>We note that for the exit rate from the two stages of symptomatic infection, the value <italic toggle="yes">γ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">Is</italic></sub> ≈ 0.43 (per week) is inferred for model BC1 (and similar values for the other UK model variants). This corresponds to a mean time from onset of symptoms to death of approximately 33 days, which is considerably more than the 18 days reported in the cohort based study of Ref. [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This discrepancy could be due to reporting delays in the mortality data of Ref. [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Also, this source includes all deaths <italic toggle="yes">involving</italic> (rather than <italic toggle="yes">due to</italic>) Covid-19, which may include deaths related to later complications.</p>
              <p>We also did the inference procedure for model C0/C1 with data for France and Germany, using appropriate forms of the intervention function, as detailed in part B in <xref rid="pone.0258968.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>. A similar change in IFR seems to be present there as well, though somewhat less pronounced in France and happening somewhat later in Germany.</p>
              <p>In <xref rid="pone.0258968.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> we show the inferred mean fraction of infected individuals, conditional on the observation of cases and deaths at all points in time. This result is compared to the data from the ONS infection survey [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], seeking to determine the fraction of the infected population through random asymptomatic testing. We note that numbers in our results are always bigger than in the infection survey, except when they are rapidly rising. This could be an indication that individuals count as infected for longer in our models than they test positive in a PCR test. Also, the fixed estimate we use for the age-dependent fraction of asymptomatic infections may be incorrect (based on early data [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], as described in our paper [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]).</p>

              </fig>
              <p>We note that differences in the conditional numbers of infections between models BC0 and BC1 mainly show up in the first wave. For that time, data from the infection survey is not available, and data on testing may be incomplete. Nonetheless, it is remarkable that the inferred numbers of infection largely agree between models BC0 and BC1 from June onwards, encompassing the inferred time of change in IFR. Hence, we can rule out that the change in IFR in model BC1 is merely due to changes in the inferred true number of cases. It is rather that the observed timeline of deaths is more likely in model BC1 than in model BC0, for similar estimated total numbers of infections.</p>
              <p>Based on the remaining discrepancies between the our inferred infection numbers and the ONS survey, one could still argue that we overestimate the true case numbers early on and/or underestimate them later, leading to an apparent increase in the IFR. The model variants TT0/TT1 and P0 serve to address this possibility.</p>
              <p>The goal of contact tracing is to detect and isolate asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and ideally to also detect cases early on in the presymptomatic stage. However, due to limited capacity, the test and trace system is only effective when case numbers are low and there is sufficient testing capacity, such as in the summer months. This could mean that with increasing testing numbers and the large-scale test and trace system being put in place in late May, the reported cases after the first wave are closer to the true cases than expected by the model variants considered so far. The results for the pair of variants TT0 and TT1, with their (albeit rudimentary) realisation of contact tracing, give no indication that this might explain an apparent change in the IFR. Quite to the contrary, TT1 infers a somewhat larger change in IFR than the Type 1 models already considered. The posterior of models TT0 and TT1 change only marginally compared to BC0 and BC1, respectively.</p>
              <p>In principle, it is possible that the inferred factor-two change in IFR in early November could instead be explained by large changes in the numbers of undiagnosed cases. We illustrate this fact using model P0. It allows for a time-dependent change of the testing priority <italic toggle="yes">π</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub>, and we deliberately set a loose prior on the timing and amplitude of this change. This model attains a posterior probability that is comparable to that of the models with a change in the IFR. (Coincidentally, prior and posterior are almost identical to those of TT1, therefore P0 is not shown in <xref rid="pone.0258968.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>.) The prior would have allowed to place the change in <italic toggle="yes">π</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub> as early as July, yet it is inferred as late November (four weeks <italic toggle="yes">after</italic> the mean of the Gaussian prior distribution). The amplitude of the change in <italic toggle="yes">π</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub> is inferred as a factor 3, unexpectedly saturating an upper bound we set on this parameter. This would mean that, to explain the data in terms of a changed testing regime rather than an actual IFR change, at the height of the second wave, tests must have become at least three times <italic toggle="yes">less</italic> targeted at symptomatic cases of COVID-19. It seems to us highly unlikely that this change could be explained, for example, by a rise in cases of flu, and we would expect evidence for this scenario to rapidly diminish under a more realistic choice of prior. We also note that, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0258968.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, the inferred true number of infections for P0 matches the data from the infection survey much worse than for models BC0 and BC1.</p>

with <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> being the number of inferred parameters. In the second line, we have used the Gaussian approximation <xref rid="pone.0258968.e010" ref-type="disp-formula">(5)</xref> to evaluate the integral. The results for the model evidence for each of the variants are listed in <xref rid="pone.0258968.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The comparison of model evidences supports the conclusions drawn in the previous Section. The first term in <xref rid="pone.0258968.e011" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq (6)</xref> is the posterior at the MAP parameters, which we have so far used as a proxy for the evidence. This term tends to dominate the integral for log<italic toggle="yes">Z</italic>, but the second term is important for penalising over-fitting. In conclusion, we see clearly that the inferred evidence for changes in the IFR are not due to over-fitting.</p>
              <p>The local Gaussian approximation of the posterior can also be used to estimate uncertainties in the inferred parameters. The inverse <bold><italic toggle="yes">H</italic></bold><sup>−1</sup> is the covariance matrix of the inferred parameters in the posterior distribution. The square root of its diagonal elements yields a single standard deviation (or 68% credible interval) for each individual parameter, such as the ones quoted in <xref rid="pone.0258968.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. (Note that the computation of the inverse Hessian performs the marginalisation over all other parameters for every diagonal element.) In the supplementary information, we provide a spreadsheet listing all inferred parameters and uncertainties (see <xref rid="pone.0258968.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). We note that a small standard deviation should not be mistaken for certainty about a particular parameter in general, if otherwise the evidence for the respective model variant is low. For instance, we notice that the uncertainty in the onset date is significantly smaller for models with a step-like change in the IFR (model variants A1, C1) than for the ones with a smooth change. This could be due to the likelihood of these models being more sensitive to short-lived weekly fluctuations in the data, fitting some sudden, albeit transient, increase in reported deaths.</p>
              <p>Moreover, we can explore the posterior distribution of the IFR before and after the change by drawing samples from the multivariate Gaussian distribution of the parameters describing the IFR. The comparison between models BC0 and BC1 in <xref rid="pone.0258968.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> shows that the IFR inferred for BC0 lies in between the early and the late value inferred for BC1, regardless of the age group. Moreover, we see that the difference between the values before and after the change is bigger than the uncertainty in any single value for the IFR. For the age-group 75–84 the IFR increases from 7(±1)% to 16(±2)% and for the age-group 85+ from 11(±1)% to 23(±2)%. The estimates for these absolute values of the IFR are in line with other reports in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Note, however, that the absolute estimates (unlike the relative change) ultimately depend on the age-dependent fraction of asymptomatic cases, which we keep fixed throughout the inference procedure.</p>

              </fig>
              <p>As a final note, we consider whether the observed evidence for a change in the IFR could be affected by confirmation bias. We had been motivated by previous reports, based on a non-Bayesian analysis [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258968.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We were specifically interested in changes in the IFR around the time when the alpha variant became dominant, and we were deliberately setting prior for the time of IFR change such that we would not pick up other, seasonal changes. In practice, however, the 2-week standard deviation in the prior does not impose a strong bias towards a specific date. For instance, a 4-week deviation from the prior mean would correspond to a change in the logarithmic prior of just two, this is very little compared to the changes in posterior and evidence that qualify the model variants with changing IFR. Moreover, for the models for France and Germany we had no such prior information, nonetheless we detect similar evidence for a changing IFR.</p>

Bayesian inference provides clear and consistent evidence for such an increase, across the suite of models we considered. This finding complements similar conclusions based on the visual inspection of nationally aggregated case and mortality data [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our approach uses the same kind of data, but we use models that differentiate between reported cases and the true number of cases. They are informed by the reported number of tests performed, implicitly accounting for a time-dependent ascertainment rate. Estimates of the absolute value of the IFR are always beset with uncertainty, due to an unconstrained dark figure of less severe or asymptomatic infections [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258968.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Nonetheless, evidence for a <italic toggle="yes">relative</italic> change in the IFR shows up clearly in our model comparison.</p>
              <p>We would not generally expect aggregated case and mortality data, analysed with a well mixed compartmental model (or suite thereof), to identify clear or definitive causes for an increase of this kind. So our conclusion is (in common with [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258968.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) that something happened to increase lethality, but the data does not clearly say what it is that happened.</p>
              <p>It is natural to speculate that the increase is related to the emergence of one or more new virus strains, whose potentially increased lethality has been the subject of several cohort-based studies summarised previously in a UK Government publication [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Those works estimate a lethality increase for B.1.1.7 by factors ranging up to 1.7 [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In contrast, a study by Davies <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. using a compartmented model including two virus strains [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] did not produce clear evidence for any change in severity (only a large increase transmissibility). From our suite of compartmented models, we infer not only a larger increase in IFR than so far attributed to B.1.1.7 severity alone, but also a most likely onset date for this increase that <italic toggle="yes">precedes</italic> the widespread emergence of B.1.1.7 in the UK. Moreover, we infer a very similar change in Germany (alongside a more modest one in France) despite even lower prevalence there, at that time, of B.1.1.7 or any comparable new strain. We argue on these grounds that the arrival of B.1.1.7 is unlikely to be the sole cause of the dramatic UK increase in IFR in late 2020.</p>
              <p>This suggests that factors such as seasonality and/or pressure on health services may have contributed to the change. Of these, seasonality more credibly would have had similar effects in the UK and Germany (and perhaps weaker effects in France, but this is far from clear). This conclusion may also be supported by a study from Israel addressing changes of in-hospital mortality rates [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. If such factors started to increase IFR in early autumn, then the MAP estimates of the onset time, for either a single step-change or a single ramped increase, might represent a compromise between two separate episodes of increasing IFR, with only the latter linked to a new variant. This could allow the fitted onset time to precede arrival of B.1.1.7, with the latter still contributing strongly to the total increase in fatality.</p>
              <p>Such arguments remain, for now, speculative. To further investigate potential connections between new variants and the observed change in IFR, one should explicitly represent the dominant mutant strain though additional model compartments, with increased infectiousness and possibly increased lethality. Such a model could be calibrated using data for the prevalence of mutant strains.</p>
              <p>The increase in lethality might also be generic for the peaks of waves of infection, when hospitals are under severe strain. We have not yet analysed the possibility for <italic toggle="yes">two</italic> changes in IFR: a reduction in spring and an increase in autumn. This might also reflect seasonal variations in the resilience of patients. Figs <xref rid="pone.0258968.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0258968.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> show that the inferred most likely trajectories actually overestimate the cases in the first wave somewhat in order to get the number of deaths right, and even more so for the models with change in IFR. The possibility of a high IFR in the first wave, falling back in late spring before rising again in autumn, might resolve this discrepancy.</p>
              <p>It will be interesting to see whether the evidence for a change in IFR persists as models become calibrated with more recent data and additional types of observations. This might include data for hospital admissions, antibody testing, or random asymptomatic testing (as already considered <italic toggle="yes">a posteriori</italic> in this report). More data would also enable more detailed versions of our models to be constructed. For example, we have neglected so far the possibility of reinfection (loss of immunity). It would be also possible to represent more accurately the timing of the progression through stages of infection [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Large-scale vaccination campaigns may also be accounted for in future variants of these models.</p>
              <p>As an additional caveat, we emphasise that these well-mixed models cannot describe regional variability, such as situations where the epidemic is shrinking in one region and growing in another. Moreover, the evidence for the UK IFR change is partly based on the relatively poor fits achieved by models with fixed IFR. It follows that if substantially improved fits were obtained for models that include regional variability (with fixed IFR), our conclusions might have to be re-evaluated. On the other hand, we are not aware of a specific mechanism by which regional variability would generate the discrepancies observed here between the models and the data. These possibilities might be also tested by future work.</p>
              <p>Finally, we would like to advocate the advantages of creating a suite of models within a single platform to which consistently identical inference procedures can be applied. It is of course valuable to have independent modelling teams doing their own preferred type of data analysis and then comparing the results of these studies to see if a consensus emerges. However, the integrated model-building and inference machinery gathered within the PyRoss platform has in this case allowed rapid implementation of a number of purpose-built models and their comparison, in a fully Bayesian way, in the month immediately following the appearance of [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. (In fact [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] was posted on medRxiv on 22 January; a complete draft of the current paper was circulated to relevant members of the UK Government advisory group SPI-M on 24 February.)</p>
              <p>The PyRoss platform [<xref rid="pone.0258968.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] is open source, and freely available to all users.</p>

              <p>Please respond to the reviewer comments on a point-by-point basis and revise the manuscript accordingly.  </p>
              <p>I'd also like the authors to explore whether fixing most of the \\pi parameters, e.g. \\pi_{Is}, affects the results.  This seems to assume that testing rates among the symptomatic didn't change over time, or merely that those changes will all be handled by the \\pi_a term (which really appears intended to represent tracing and capture of asymptomatics).  Is this assumption a problem for constraining fluctuating testing capacity and demand for testing rates over time?  Evidence suggests that ascertainment rates increased over time, which would work against the rising IFR reported here.  What do the raw case fatality rates show (when convolving cases forward to deaths)?  Do they rise as well?  How about the hospitalization fatality rates?  Do they rise or fall in the study period?  This can be pulled from observations and provide an indication as to whether clinical treatment has improved.  Is your main finding the result of a poorly constrained total number of infection (i.e. the ascertainment rate)?</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The paper was a pleasure to read. The summary is excellent. The clear way in which you present your models and your results gives me total confidence in your work. I recommend that it should be published. It is valuable not only for its results but also because it provides a nice demonstration of your methods and of your PyRoss software package and will help others to build on this. I only have two suggestions 1) please make the code available online and 2) it would be nice if you could give the reader access to the MAP values for all inferred parameters. I would have liked to check whether they look believable, but I also think I would have learned something from them.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Dear editor,</p>
              <p>the manuscript analyses public COVID-19 data in the UK, France and</p>
              <p>Germany using a SEIR type compartmental model. The text is clearly</p>
              <p>written and the proposed models interesting and well thought-out.</p>
              <p>The authors conclude that the IFR in the UK and Germany was higher</p>
              <p>in the end of 2020 by a factor of around 2 when compared to the</p>
              <p>first semester. They also conclude that this increase precedes the</p>
              <p>widespread circulation of the new major SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7.</p>
              <p>I consider this a very strong claim which is not convincingly</p>
              <p>backed by the methods and analyzed data presented in the current</p>
              <p>manuscript. I cannot recommend publication unless the authors are</p>
              <p>able to provide further details and/or revise their analysis in</p>
              <p>order to better substantiate their main conclusion.</p>
              <p>I explain below both my major and minor concerns in detail.</p>
              <p>MAJOR POINTS</p>
              <p>1 - The authors make use of the PyRoss package in order to evaluate</p>
              <p>their posterior and quote maximum posterior values for their</p>
              <p>parameters. Although I understand this package was already</p>
              <p>discussed in more detail in a previous manuscript, the authors</p>
              <p>should explain here in more detail the methods involved in their</p>
              <p>analysis. For instance, are the quoted values for the IFR change</p>
              <p>marginalized over all other model parameters? Was the posterior</p>
              <p>sampled with MCMC methods or is it the maxima found with a simpler</p>
              <p>scheme? If the latter, what is the justification and how accurate</p>
              <p>is it?</p>
              <p>2 - Why do the authors refrain from quoting confidence intervals CI</p>
              <p>(ideally highest density intervals) in most of their results? The</p>
              <p>claim that "the calculation is tedious" seems unjustifiable, as the</p>
              <p>discussed method based on the Hessian seems to be the very well</p>
              <p>established method of using the Fisher information Matrix. In</p>
              <p>particular the Li et al. 2020 paper which describes the package</p>
              <p>PyRoss discusses the implementation of both MCMC and Fisher</p>
              <p>information Matrix methods. In order to help make sense of the main</p>
              <p>results for the IFR I consider estimations of the marginalized CI</p>
              <p>for all main results imperative. Ideally one should show plots of</p>
              <p>the posterior for the IFR (before, after and mean IFR for the</p>
              <p>models without a change) for at least some models. Also, in the 2</p>
              <p>cases for which uncertainties are shown, they seem quite narrow,</p>
              <p>specially for the German IFR factor. Is that expected after</p>
              <p>marginalization over dozens of parameters?</p>
              <p>3 - The authors choose not to make a full model-comparison using</p>
              <p>the Bayesian evidence and instead rely on a simple analysis of the</p>
              <p>maxima of the Posterior. I think that if the full evidence cannot</p>
              <p>be computed due to computational complexity, at least some better</p>
              <p>quantitative proxy for it should be employed. Alternatives are the</p>
              <p>Akaike or Bayesian Information Criteria, which are fast to compute.</p>
              <p>Or at the very least a Goodness of Fit test.</p>
              <p>4 - The main conclusion is that the IFR seems to have increased by</p>
              <p>a factor of around 2 in the end of 2020. Nowhere in the text</p>
              <p>however are the actual inferred values for the IFR (before and</p>
              <p>after) written down. Nor is there a discussion on how these</p>
              <p>estimates compare with other IFR estimates in the literature (for</p>
              <p>the UK or other countries), specially with those which do not rely</p>
              <p>on similar modelling.</p>
              <p>5 - As the authors claim, for IFR estimates one needs accurate</p>
              <p>estimates of the total number of cases, including undiagnosed ones.</p>
              <p>As the authors point our a bias in the estimated number of cases</p>
              <p>indifferent months can affect their inferred IFR increase. This</p>
              <p>point deserves a more careful discussion as any IFR estimate hinges</p>
              <p>strongly on the estimation of the total number of cases. I would</p>
              <p>like the authors to discuss in more detail how the ONS random</p>
              <p>asymptomatic testing was conducted and how reliable are their</p>
              <p>estimates. How does it compare with other random seroprevalence</p>
              <p>surveys (in the UK or elsewhere)?</p>
              <p>MINOR POINTS</p>
              <p>1 - There have been estimates in the literature of the time lag</p>
              <p>between contagion and mortality and between development of symptoms</p>
              <p>and mortality. How do these estimates compare with the values in</p>
              <p>the models used?</p>
              <p>2 - Some variables are not clearly defined in the text, which may</p>
              <p>hinder understanding readers less familiar with SEIR models. For</p>
              <p>instance: phi_X, gamma_A, gamma_E, a(t), s(t).</p>
              <p>3 - For the models with allow a step-change in IFR values the</p>
              <p>window for change has a narrow 2-week sigma. Is it possible that by</p>
              <p>using a much broader window the models could have preferred a much</p>
              <p>different change time? In other words, since there has already been</p>
              <p>claims of a change of IFR in the period considered, could this "a</p>
              <p>posteriori information" be biasing the models?</p>
              <p>4 - The full list of parameters for the models (at least A0) should</p>
              <p>be more explicitly written down in an appendix.</p>

                <bold>Comments to the Author</bold>
              </p>
              <p>1. If the authors have adequately addressed your comments raised in a previous round of review and you feel that this manuscript is now acceptable for publication, you may indicate that here to bypass the “Comments to the Author” section, enter your conflict of interest statement in the “Confidential to Editor” section, and submit your "Accept" recommendation.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: All comments have been addressed</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>2. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>3. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>6. Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors carried out a large revision which addressed the majority of my criticisms. They also provided detailed explanations in their response letter. I thus consider that the revised manuscript can now be accepted for publication.</p>
              <p>I leave final minor comments that the authors may consider implementing in the final, published version.</p>
              <p>1 - Even though it is well cited, I'm not sure it makes sense to cite the very controversial Ioannidis study without taking the time to properly assess its very important limitations. I suggest the authors consider alternative studies such as Meyerowitz-Katz et al IJID 2020, Hauser et al PLOS Medicine 2020, Roques et al Biology 2020, Salje et al, Science 2020, O’Driscoll et al Nature 2021, Marra et al IJID 2021.</p>
              <p>2 - I understand IFR is highly dependent on age, but I still consider it would enhance the manuscript if some values were included in the main text. One could either perform a weighted average over the 6 age bins using estimates of age demographics or simply quote one or two age bins. Of course, the caveats regarding the absolute estimation of the IFR with the used data would need to be highlighted in these numbers.</p>
              <p>3 - Maybe the authors should consider including in the main text a sentence summarizing heir response as to why a narrow 2-week window is considered not to affect their results.</p>
              <p>4 - In the new Section 5 the authors should consider briefly mentioning that the diagonal terms of the inverse Hessian already provides the credible intervals which include marginalization over all other parameters.</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>7. PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ext-link-type="uri">what does this mean?</ext-link>). If published, this will include your full peer review and any attached files.</p>
              <p>If you choose “no”, your identity will remain anonymous but your review may still be made public.</p>
              <p><bold>Do you want your identity to be public for this peer review?</bold> For information about this choice, including consent withdrawal, please see our <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.plos.org/privacy-policy" ext-link-type="uri">Privacy Policy</ext-link>.</p>
