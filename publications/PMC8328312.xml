              <abstract>
                <p>SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the world, causing high mortality and unprecedented restrictions on social and economic activity. Policymakers are assessing how best to navigate through the ongoing epidemic, with computational models being used to predict the spread of infection and assess the impact of public health measures. Here, we present OpenABM-Covid19: an agent-based simulation of the epidemic including detailed age-stratification and realistic social networks. By default the model is parameterised to UK demographics and calibrated to the UK epidemic, however, it can easily be re-parameterised for other countries. OpenABM-Covid19 can evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions, including both manual and digital contact tracing, and vaccination programmes. It can simulate a population of 1 million people in seconds per day, allowing parameter sweeps and formal statistical model-based inference. The code is open-source and has been developed by teams both inside and outside academia, with an emphasis on formal testing, documentation, modularity and transparency. A key feature of OpenABM-Covid19 are its Python and R interfaces, which has allowed scientists and policymakers to simulate dynamic packages of interventions and help compare options to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic.</p>

                <p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, computational modelling has been used to inform key uncertainties facing policymakers such as the number of cases and deaths, hospital capacity, tests and contact tracers. Models need to be: sufficiently complex to yield realistic predictions; computationally efficient to allow calibrations; and easy to use so that various policy mixes can be evaluated. OpenABM-Covid19 is a detailed epidemic model of the spread of COVID-19, simulating every individual in a population. Our model enables scientists and policymakers to quickly compare the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns, testing, quarantine, and digital and manual contact tracing. The model considers a hypothetical city with a default population of 1 million people whose ages and contact patterns are parameterised according to UK demographics. All of the parameters are openly documented and modifiable so that they can be adapted to fit other countries’ data, and refined to match our understanding of COVID-19 as the epidemic progresses. The computer model simulates people’s movement between their homes, workplaces, schools, and social interactions. OpenABM-Covid19 is open source and has been developed collaboratively by teams from academia and industry. Its modularity, documentation, testing framework, and accessibility via Python and R have provided validation, invited contributions, and encouraged wide adoption.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in China in late 2019 and spread across the globe in early 2020, causing several hundred thousand deaths world-wide in the first half of the year and overwhelming health systems [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Restrictions on movement were imposed in many countries, with severe impacts on social life, education, and economies [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mathematical models have long been used to explain and forecast the course of epidemics and to predict the effects of public health interventions [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Most governments and policymakers use mathematical models to inform their decision-making [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The scientific community has responded by adapting old models and designing new models to learn more about the COVID-19 epidemic and inform public health.</p>
              <p>Compared to compartmental models and branching-process models, agent-based models (ABMs) of the spread of infection allow for a more complete representation of the social contact network in which contagion occurs [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Major advantages include the ability to simulate heterogeneity in contact rates and local saturation effects, and the ability to better simulate contact tracing. Alongside other non-pharmaceutical interventions, contact tracing is an important intervention to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In an ABM, the full history of all contacts can be stored, allowing for the impact of contact tracing to be explored in detail. For example, ABMs can include clustering in the contact network, so if incidence is high in a region of the contact network, an uninfected person who is contract-traced will be protected from this high level of local incidence. A downside of ABMs is that they are comparatively complex to code, are often not very parsimonious, and can be very computationally intensive to run, limiting the ability to explore a wide range of parameter combinations. ABMs have been used throughout the COVID19 pandemic to inform the public health response [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Here, we focus on developing OpenABM-Covid19, an agent-based simulation which addresses these downsides, by focussing on parsimony, computational efficiency, code transparency, and a robust testing framework.</p>
              <p>A particular focus of our work applying OpenABM-Covid19 has been exploring different ways in which contact tracing, and in particular digital contact tracing using mobile phone apps that record proximity events, can contribute to epidemic control [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Several other groups have approached this problem with similar ABMs [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>We developed the agent-based model OpenABM-Covid19 to simulate an outbreak of COVID-19 in an urban environment. The default population is one million inhabitants with demographic structure based upon UK-wide census data, and household size and age-structure matched to data from the UK 2011 Census survey (for example, older people tend to live together and young children tend to live with younger adults).</p>
              <p>On a daily basis all individuals in the model move between networks representing households and either workplaces, schools, or regular social environments for older people. Individuals also interact through random networks representing public transport, transient social gatherings etc. Membership of each type of network is determined by age, giving rise to age-assortative mixing patterns. Network parameters are chosen such that the average number of interactions match age-stratified data reported in [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The number of daily interactions in random networks is drawn from a negative binomial distribution, allowing for rare super-spreading events.</p>
              <p>Infections are seeded in the population and spread through the networks. Biological and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 disease have been derived from the scientific literature. The model takes into account asymptomatic infections and different stages of severity, and includes the simulation of hospitalisations and ICU admissions. Since symptoms, disease progression and infectiousness are highly age-dependent, disease pathways in the model are age-stratified.</p>
              <p>The ABM was developed to simulate different non-pharmaceutical interventions including lockdown, physical distancing, self-isolation on symptoms, testing and both manual and digital contact tracing. Modelling contact tracing requires the model to keep a record of previous interventions for a set number of days. A variety of contact tracing algorithms are included in the ABM, including tracing on symptoms and/or after a positive test, notifying first-degree contacts only or second-degree contacts as well, notifying household members or contacts of household members, testing of traced contacts, and imperfections in test-trace-isolate programmes such as delays, missed contacts and partial compliance. The model reports both aggregated data, such as incidence, tests required, individuals quarantined for various reasons, etc., and individual data such as transmission relationships.</p>
              <p>OpenABM-Covid19 is available on Github (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/OpenABM-Covid19" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/OpenABM-Covid19</ext-link>), including model documentation, dictionaries for input parameters and output files, over 200 tests in a consistent testing framework used in model validation, and examples for running the model. The core of the model is implemented in the C language for speed; however, the model is run via Python using a SWIG-interface (see Implementation Details). This interface allows for dynamic intervention strategies to be modelled, as well as providing full transparency about the state of the model. This manuscript was prepared using v1.0 of the model and code for reproducing all figures in this manuscript from model output are publicly available online (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/OpenABM-Covid19-model-paper" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/OpenABM-Covid19-model-paper</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>OpenABM-Covid19 enables simulation of interventions to help policymakers determine the best options to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic in various settings. Default demographic parameters were chosen to reflect the UK and fit well to the COVID-19 epidemic in England; however, all parameters of the model can be changed by the user.</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p>OpenABM-Covid19 was originally developed for evaluating the design of digital contact-tracing applications for the technology division of the National Health Service (NHSX) in April 2020 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This work quantified the importance of rapid test processing and the level of user uptake required for digital contact-tracing to be effective. In a further study, OpenABM-Covid19 was used to investigate the benefits of deploying an application based on Google’s Exposure Notification System (ENS) in Washington State [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This study included a calibration of the model to County-level data and demonstrated that digital contact-tracing provides benefits even when manual contact-tracing is deployed. OpenABM-Covid19 has been used throughout the pandemic by the National Health Service England (NHSE) to model hospital admissions at a regional level in England [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>Whilst the principle aim of this paper is to give a detailed description of the model and its software interfaces, we now demonstrate some results of the model. First we look at some general features of the model including the interaction networks, the infection dynamics and the effect of population size. Next, we consider a case-study of the first wave of the COVID19 epidemic in England to demonstrate that a lightweight calibration can provide a close fit to several pieces of observed data. Finally, we simulate some of the intervention strategies which can be modelled by OpenABM-Covid19, including the requisite Python or R code, to demonstrate how complex multi-component intervention strategies can be simulated.</p>

                  <title>Interaction networks</title>
                  <p>In each of the interaction networks, individuals are represented as nodes. Constant and dynamic connections occur between the nodes in the networks, representing interactions between individuals. The three networks represent different types of daily interactions: household, occupation (workplaces, schools or regular social environments for older people), and random (public transport, essential shopping, transient social gatherings) (<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The interaction networks have two roles in the ABM. First, the infection can be transmitted between two individuals on a day that they interact. Second, the interactions for each individual are stored and can be used for contact tracing. The membership of different networks leads to age-group assortativity in the interactions. Details of the construction of these three networks are given in the Methods. The distribution of the number of interactions on a simulated network by type and by age are shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>. Note how the mean number of contacts decreases with age as found in empirical studies [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The total number of interactions on the household network by age are shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>. Note how interactions are clustered on the diagonal (people of the same age tend to live to live together) and the off-diagonal between children and adults aged 30 to 50 years (families).</p>

                  <title>Infection dynamics</title>
                  <p>The infection is spread by interactions between infected (source) and susceptible (recipient) individuals. The rate of transmission is determined by three factors: the infectiousness of the source, the age-dependent susceptibility of the recipient, and the type of interaction, i.e. on which network it occurred. Details of the infection model and how it was calibrated are in the Methods.</p>
                  <p>An example of how transmissions can be stratified by the infection status of the source and the age of both source and recipient is depicted in <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>. In this simulation of an uncontrolled epidemic, most transmissions occur from pre-symptomatic individuals with mild disease who are more numerous than individuals who go on to develop severe disease, followed by symptomatic individuals with mild disease. Interventions that reduce the rate of growth of transmission will change the relative contributions of different symptomatic stages. Note that the largest number of transmissions occur pre-symptomatically before a mild infection in adults and children of secondary school age.</p>

                  <p>An important property of the epidemic is the offspring distribution which quantifies the amount of super-spreading. The offspring distribution was calculated by counting transmissions from the first 1% of people infected (i.e. the first 10,000 individuals) during the initial exponential growth phase of a simulation (<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S19 Fig</xref>). A negative-binomial distribution was fit using maximum likelihood estimation and gave an estimate of k = 0.5. This estimate is in-line with empirical estimates from surveys which give the estimates of 0.49–0.52 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], 0.35–1.18 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and 0.32–0.49 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The simulation to estimate k was run using the R interface for OpenABM and the code is shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S20 Fig</xref>.</p>
                  <p>The household secondary attack rate was calculated by counting the number of intra-household transmissions from the first person infected in each household and who was also in the first 1% of people infected in the initial exponential growth phase of a simulation. The household secondary attack rate for the default parameterisation of the model is 25%, which lies within the range of empirical estimates from Germany (21%) [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the US (24%) [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and the Netherlands (28%) [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Note that estimates from China are lower [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], however, the European/US studies are more applicable for a UK simulation.</p>

                  <p>We investigate the sensitivity of the model on the total population and the effect of aggregating sub-populations by estimating the systematic and stochastic variability of key statistics of the epidemic (<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S16 Fig</xref>, details in legend). The analysis showed that the stochastic variation in doubling rate (mean 3.5 days) was less than 0.2 days and the total number infected (mean 85%) less than 0.5% for simulations with at least 1 million people. The results showed no measurable difference in the mean value of the statistics for populations greater than 50k. Additionally, there was no measurable difference between running a simulation on a single population and aggregating across sub-populations with the same total population.</p>

                <title>Simulated epidemic for first wave in England (spring 2020)</title>
                <p>The model was run on a population of 56 million people with UK demographics for the first wave of the COVID19 epidemic in England, by aggregating 56 simulations of 1 million people.

                  <title>Digital contact tracing</title>
                  <p>Contact tracing is vital to control epidemics with a high level of pre-symptomatic transmission. A variable fraction of individuals in each group can be assigned to have a digital contact tracing smartphone app. Ownership of smartphones is based on age-stratified OFCOM data (<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s026" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s031" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Table</xref>). Digital contact tracing can only occur between two app users. Digital proximity sensing is likely to miss some interactions, so when contact tracing a number of interactions are randomly dropped. For contact tracing, the model takes into account all interactions the individual has had with other app-users for the past seven days which have not been dropped. The model can simulate different app-based contact tracing algorithms. The app can send out notifications with the request to quarantine based on symptoms, or based on a positive test result of the index case. It can ask the household members of the index case and/or household members of the contacts to quarantine and also send out notifications deeper into the network if desired. It can request tests for contacts of index cases if desired. <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref> demonstrates how digital contact tracing following rapid testing can prevent a second wave even when the average uptake is at only 50% of the total population. <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref> demonstrates the calculation of the benefit to individuals of digital contact tracing.</p>

                  <title>Manual contact tracing</title>
                  <p>Manual contact tracing works in a similar way to digital contact tracing with a few key differences. First, since it does not rely on an individual being a smartphone user, it can originate from anybody who tests positive (particularly important in the elderly where smartphone usage is lower). However, since the identification of interactions relies on the index case recalling them, only a fraction of actual interactions are traced. In particular, the fraction of interactions recalled depends on the type of interaction (i.e. occupation based interactions are more likely to be recalled than random interactions). Manual contact tracing only occurs after a delay following a positive test, to account for contact tracers contacting both the index and traced individuals. Finally, during a peak in the epidemic the amount of contact tracing required increases and risks overwhelming a manual contact tracing service. Therefore the model contains constraints on the total number of interviews that contact tracers can perform on a single day. <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 Fig</xref> demonstrates how a well-staffed manual contact tracing following rapid testing can lessen a second wave.</p>

                  <p>Contact traced individuals can be asked to quarantine (default 14 days) either because they are directly traced or because they are a household member of somebody who has been traced. Like self-isolation, quarantine is modelled by stopping interactions on the workplace network and greatly reducing the number of interactions on the random network. The model includes a daily dropout rate to simulate imperfect adherence. Quarantine can be ended if the index case later tests negative (after tracing based upon their symptoms), or if the quarantined individual tests negative.</p>

Two types of vaccines are modelled: full protection where an individual cannot be infected; or protection from symptoms, where an individual can be infected but is asymptomatic. Efficacy is modelled as all-or-nothing for each individual, and for those who gain protection there is a delay between inoculation and the time at which the vaccine gives protection. The Python and R interfaces allow a vaccine schedule by age to be specified and multiple types of vaccine can be applied in a single simulation. <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S17 Fig</xref> demonstrates the effect of a vaccine programme (both full and from-symptoms protection) where 2% of the adult population are vaccinated each and <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S18 Fig</xref> shows the R code used to simulate a bespoke vaccination programme.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We present OpenABM-Covid19, a COVID-19-specific agent-based model suitable for simulating the epidemic in different settings and assessing non-pharmaceutical interventions, including contact tracing using a mobile phone app. The model is well documented with a simple interface, allowing non-experts to easily evaluate complex dynamic intervention strategies in a few lines of Python or R code. OpenABM-Covid19 is an open-source project and is easily extensible, with new features already being added by multiple external teams. The model is fully documented and is thoroughly tested in a formal testing framework.</p>
              <p>The model was designed to be as parsimonious as possible, with complexity only added when it was essential to model important features of COVID-19 or details of non-pharmaceutical interventions, and with parameters being inferred from published studies. Due to the substantial pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission of the virus, it is necessary to model each individual’s normal daily interactions. Further, on developing symptoms or during interventions such as contact tracing, the interaction pattern of individuals changes to only include those in the household. We therefore took the decision to model interactions using three social networks (household/occupational/random) with non-pharmaceutical interventions affecting each network differently. Recurring small-world networks were used to model interactions at home and at work, whereas a transient random network was used to model other daily interactions such as on public transport or in shops. The strong association of COVID-19 disease progression with age along with the age assortativity of social networks, led us to use a decade age-structure. The model simulated an urban population of 1 million rather than the population of a whole country to allow realistic estimates for hospitalisation and ICU admission forecasts on a regional level. Nevertheless, its use can be extended to perform an analysis on a country-wide level, as in <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> for England. Large national epidemics will also exhibit meta-population dynamics rather than the spatially unstructured mixing modelled here.</p>
              <p>One of the key aims of OpenABM-Covid19 was to model non-pharmaceutical interventions and, in particular, different forms of contact tracing. The model of digital contact tracing allows for questions such as the role of: testing delays, different quarantine requests, compliance rates, recursive testing, and app uptake to be investigated. The model of manual contact tracing allows for questions such as resource limitations, partial contact recall and interview delays to be investigated. The vaccination model allows for questions such as the order in which people are vaccinated to be investigated. Importantly, due to the simple Python and R interfaces it is possible for non-experts to simulate all these features and to investigate the effect of applying multiple intervention policies at different stages of the epidemic.</p>
              <p>The current version of the model does not include nosocomial transmissions, transmission in care-home settings, non-hospital deaths, gender/sex of individuals, comorbidities, or any geographical structure apart from that implicit within the three modelled networks. All of these limitations are being currently addressed by collaborators and will become available on the Github repository in the near future. For example, a preliminary hospital model has been created to characterise the effect of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between patients, health-care workers and the wider community. The hospital model allocates patients to general and ITU wards according to symptoms; and then models the interactions between patients and healthcare workers within wards and the hospital as a whole. The hospital model is currently available on the Github repository.</p>
              <p>Another important area to develop will be the modelling of multiple-variants of SARS-CoV2. The current version of the model supports multiple-variants with different transmission rates, but assumes complete cross-immunity between variants. Whilst this is a reasonable model for the B.1.1.7 variant, it will be insufficient for modelling the B.1.351 or P.1 variants. These limitations are being addressed by collaborators and will become available on the Github repository in the near future.</p>
              <p>OpenABM-Covid19 is a versatile tool to model the COVID-19 epidemic in different settings and simulate different non-pharmaceutical interventions including contact tracing. OpenABM-Covid19 is a modular tool that will help scientists and policymakers weigh decisions during this epidemic. Our vision is that, with the help of the world-wide modelling community, it will develop into a family of models for infectious diseases that are at risk of causing pandemics in the future, adding to the international toolkit for epidemic preparedness.</p>

                <title>Demographics</title>
                <p>Within the ABM, individuals are categorised into nine age groups by decade, from “0–9 year” to “80+ years”. Decades were used instead of broader age groups because of the strong age-structure of the disease progression. By default, the demographics of the ABM are set to UK national data for 2018 from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). The proportion of individuals in each age group is the same as that specified by the population level statistics in <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>. Since we only consider simulating the epidemics up to a year, we do not consider changes in the population due to births, deaths due to other causes, and migration.</p>

                <title>Interaction network</title>
                <p>A previous study of social contacts for infectious disease modelling, based on participants being asked to recall their interactions over the past day, has estimated the mean number of interactions that individuals have by age group [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We estimate mean interactions by age group by aggregating data (<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s024" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> depicts the resulting distribution of contacts by network and <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> by age.</p>
                <p>Every individual is assigned to live in a single household. The household network is formed by all members of every household interacting with each other every day. The distribution of household sizes is the ONS estimate for the UK in 2018 (<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). In addition to the household size, the mix of ages in households is important since multi-generational households provide a path by which the infection can be transmitted from young to old. To model this we used a reference panel of 10,000 households taken by down-sampling the UK-wide household composition data from the 2011 Census produced by the ONS. The overall household structure was generated by sampling from the reference household panel with replacement and using rejection-sampling to match the aggregate statistics for the age demographics and household size. The rejection-sampling method sequentially adds sampled households to the network if the deviation between the aggregate statistics and the target values (also from the ONS) was less than an acceptance threshold. The acceptance threshold is reduced as the sampled network grows and the final network is only accepted if the aggregate demographic and household size statistics are within tolerance of the targets (sum square error &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>). The household members then makes up the population in the model. The number of daily interactions on a simulated network within each household by age is shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>.</p>
                <p>Each individual is also a member of a recurring occupation network to model school, workplace or social networks. The occupation networks are modelled as small-world networks [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The network has a fixed set of connections between individuals, and each day a random subset (50%) of these connections are chosen as the interactions between individuals. When constructing the occupation networks, the ABM ensures the absence of overlaps between the household interactions and the local interactions on the small-world network. For children, there are separate occupation networks for the 0–9 year age group (i.e. nursery/primary school) and the 10–19 year age group (i.e secondary school). On each of these networks we introduce a small number of adults (1 adult per 5 children) to represent teaching and other school staff. Similarly for the 70–79 year age group and the 80+ year age group we created separate networks representing daytime social activities among elderly people (again with 1 younger adult per 5 elderly people to represent some mixing between the age groups). All remaining adults (the vast majority) are part of the 20–69 network. Due to the difference in total number of daily interactions, each age group has a different number of interactions in their occupation network. Parameters and values corresponding to the occupation network are shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s025" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>. The number of daily interactions on a simulated occupational network by age is shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>.</p>
                <p>In addition to the recurring structured networks of households and occupations, we include random interactions. These are drawn randomly each day, independent of previous connections. The number of random connections an individual makes is the same each day (in the absence of interventions), drawn at the start of the simulation from an over-dispersed negative-binomial distribution. This variation in the number of interactions introduces some “super-spreaders” into the network who have many more interactions than average. The mean numbers of connections were chosen so that the total number of daily interactions matched that from a previous study of social interaction [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The number of random interactions was chosen to be lower in children in comparison to other age groups. Interactions in the random network are listed in <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s026" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>. The number of daily interactions on a simulated random network by age is shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>.</p>
                <p>OpenABM also allows users to specify their own networks which can be added in addition (or instead of) to the default networks in the model. An example of how to add a user specified network via the R interface is given in <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13 Fig</xref>.</p>

                <title>Infection dynamics</title>
                <p>Infectiousness varies over the natural course of an infection, i.e. as a function of the amount of time the source has been infected, τ. Infectiousness starts at zero at the point of infection (τ = 0), increases to a peak at an intermediate time, and decreases to zero a long time after infection (large τ). Following [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we took the functional form of infectiousness to be a scaled gamma distribution. We chose the mean and standard deviation as intermediate values between different studies [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Once infected, we split individuals into three groups based upon the eventual severity of the disease: asymptomatic, mild symptomatic and moderate-severe symptomatics. The level of infectiousness depends upon this grouping, i.e. pre-symptomatic individuals who go on to develop moderate-severe symptoms are more infectious than those who go on to develop mild symptoms. By default, the overall infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals and individuals with mild symptoms, is 0.33 and 0.72 times that of individuals with moderate-severe symptoms respectively [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
                <p>The susceptibility of the recipient to infection is modelled with a scale factor dependent on the recipient’s age. To determine these factors, we identified studies of whether or not transmission occurred from index cases to monitored close contacts [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Lower probability of infection in children was reported in almost all studies, including that of Zhang et al [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] which observed more infections than the rest of the studies combined, with consistent adjustment for other covariates of transmission risk. We used the susceptibility by age of Zhang et al., interpolated to match our ten-year age categories. The merged data and fit are shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s027" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>.</p>

Whilst we do not have data on the length of interactions, interactions which take place within a person’s home are likely to be closer than other types of interactions leading to higher rates of transmission. This is modelled using a scale factor, which is 2 by default and gives a good estimate of the household secondary attack rate (see <xref rid="sec002" ref-type="sec">Results</xref> section). Finally, to fully account for the over-dispersion in offspring infections, we add an individual infectious factor which is drawn independently for each individual (and is the same for all their interactions).

                <p>A fraction Φ<sub>asym</sub>(age) of individuals are asymptomatic and do not develop symptoms, a fraction Φ<sub>mild</sub>(age) will eventually develop mild symptoms, and the remainder develop moderate/severe symptoms. Each of these proportions depend on the age of the infected individual (<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s029" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>). Those who are asymptomatic are infectious at a lower level (see Infection Dynamics section) and will move to a recovered state after a time τ<sub>a,rec</sub> drawn from a gamma distribution.</p>
                <p>Once an individual is recovered the model allows immunity to wane through time using two parameters: a fixed period for which every individual must wait, τ<sub>waning-shift</sub>, and then a geometric distribution of waiting times until individuals become susceptible, parameterised by its mean τ<sub>waning-mean</sub>. By default, the model assumes τ<sub>waning-shift</sub> to be 10,000 days (essentially no waning immunity). During this waiting period, infection is assumed to be completely immunising (recovered individuals cannot be reinfected).</p>
                <p>Individuals who will develop symptoms start by being in a pre-symptomatic state, in which they are infectious but have no symptoms. The pre-symptomatic state is important for modelling interventions because individuals in this state do not realise they are infectious and therefore will not self-isolate based on symptoms to prevent infecting others. Individuals who develop mild symptoms do so after time τ<sub>sym</sub> and then recover after time τ<sub>rec</sub> (both drawn from gamma distributions). The remaining individuals develop moderate/severe symptoms after a time τ<sub>sym</sub> drawn from the gamma distribution.</p>
                <p>Whilst most individuals recover without requiring hospitalisation, a fraction Φ<sub>hosp</sub>(age) of those with moderate/severe symptoms will require hospitalisation. This fraction is age-dependent. Those who do not require hospitalisation recover after a time τ<sub>rec</sub> drawn from a gamma distribution, whilst those who require hospitalisation are admitted to hospital after a time τ<sub>hosp</sub>, which is drawn from a shifted Bernoulli distribution. Among all hospitalised individuals, a fraction Φ<sub>crit</sub>(age) develop critical symptoms and require intensive care treatment, with the remainder recovering after a time τ<sub>hosp</sub>,<sub>rec</sub> drawn from a gamma distribution. The time from hospitalisation to developing critical symptoms, τ<sub>crit</sub>, is drawn from a shifted Bernoulli distribution. Of those who develop critical symptoms, a fraction Φ<sub>ICU</sub>(age) will receive intensive care treatment. For patients receiving intensive care treatment, a fraction Φ<sub>death</sub>(age) die after a time τ<sub>death</sub> drawn from a gamma distribution, with the remainder leaving intensive care after a time τ<sub>crit,surv</sub>. Patients who require critical care and do not receive intensive care treatment are assumed to die upon developing critical symptoms. Patients who survive critical symptoms remain in hospital for τ<sub>hosp,rec</sub> before recovering.</p>
                <p>OpenABM-Covid19 also includes a meta-population model which runs a simulation on parallel sub-populations (which can be parameterised separately). After each time step, new cases can be seeded in each region based upon the incidence of infections in connected sub-populations.</p>

                <title>Implementation details</title>
                <p>The core of OpenABM-Covid19 is coded in C with object-oriented interfaces in Python and R. The code is written in a modular manner to ease readability and encourage extension of the code base. It is open source and is being actively developed by multiple teams. The model uses the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) for mathematical functions, statistical distributions, and random number generation [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and so any distribution or function available within the GSL can be easily incorporated into the model (for instance in modelling waiting-time distributions). Memory is pre-allocated at the start of the simulation for efficiency.</p>
                <p>An important feature of the implementation are the Python and R interfaces using SWIG, which is a package for providing interfaces between high-level languages and C/C++ [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Running the model via Python allows for complex dynamic interventions strategies to be easily modelled (see examples in <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref> Figs). All states of the model (e.g. transmission events, interactions, individual characteristics) are exposed in Python, which gives full transparency to the results of the model. For example, <xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 Fig</xref> is a Notebook showing how to calculate the relative personal protective effect of app users versus non-app users when digital contact tracing is used. Python is also a ubiquitous language amongst data scientists, and the interface allows them to fully interact with the model whilst keeping the high speed and memory performance of C.</p>
                <p>The metapopulation model is implemented in Python using the standard module <italic toggle="yes">multiprocessing</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], with each sub-population running in a separate process. Both the initial model set-up and the daily time-step are run in parallel, allowing for approximate linear speed-ups when running on a multi-core machine.</p>
                <p>The model codebase includes over 200 tests used to validate the model. Each test ensures an expected output from the model is realised for a specified set of input parameters. Tests are written in a consistent manner, using the pytest framework. All tests are automatically run when new contributions to the codebase are made. Tests vary input parameters ensuring that expected behaviour of the model is realised across a wide range of input parameter values. Tests cover a range of domains including: disease dynamics, infection and transmission dynamics, non-pharmaceutical interventions, network construction, the C and Python interface, the waiting time distributions, file concordance across the multiple output files from the model, and non-disease related demographics.</p>

                  <title>Performance</title>
                  <p>The computational efficiency was measured by simulating an epidemic with default parameters until the total prevalence reached 1%; then reducing the transmission rates on the occupational and random networks so that R was reduced to 1; and simulating for 100 days in total. On a 2019 MacBookPro (2.4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5), the simulation took 1.5s per day for a population of 1m people and scaled linearly with population size (<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15A Fig</xref>). The time is dominated by daily rebuilding of networks, and running the simulation with static-networks took 50ms per day for a population of 1m people. The meta-population model of OpenABM with multiple sub-populations of 100k running in parallel threads took 250ms per day for a total population of 1m people. The meta-population model with static-networks took 15ms per day for a population of 1m people. The persistent memory used in the simulation was measured using the iprofiler command and Instruments. For a simulation where only 1 day of interactions are stored, the persistent memory is about 1kb per person (<xref rid="pcbi.1009146.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15B Fig</xref>) and scales linearly with the population. The memory usage is split in approximate thirds between: networks; interactions; and data about individuals (e.g. timings of events such as infection). For a simulation where 7 days of interactions are stored (i.e. for contact-tracing modelling), the persistent memory is about 3kb per person of which about 80% is storing the interactions.</p>

                  <title>Scaling and stochastic variation.</title>
                  <p>Simulations for epidemics were run for different population sizes and split into different numbers of equal sub-populations in meta-models (zero case migration). Initially the epidemic was seeded with 0.05% infections and an uncontrolled epidemic was allowed to develop for 100 days, with approximately no new infections at the end. A minimum of 20k people was required in each subpopulation in order for there to be sufficient seed infections to prevent a stochastic extinction at the start. Each simulated epidemic was characterised by 2 basic statistics: the doubling time in days to go from 1% to 2% of the population infected; and the total fraction of the population infected. Each configuration was run 10 times and the figure is a box plot of the results, with the number of subpopulations shown as separate colours. The simulations show that the mean doubling time and fraction infected are roughly independent of the total population size. The stochastic variation is determined by the total population and is independent of the number of subpopulations. With a total population of at least 1 million people, the stochastic variation in the doubling time was &lt;0.2 days and in the total number infected was &lt;0.5%.</p>

                  <p>A simulation of a vaccine programme implemented after a lockdown period to control the epidemic. The epidemic was allowed to grow until 2% of the population had been infected, at which point a lockdown was implemented for 30 days along with a vaccination programme where 2% of adults were inoculated each day (vaccine 90% effective after 15-days). The figure compares the total deaths and infections for a vaccine which offers full protection from symptoms, to one which only offers protection from symptoms and to no vaccine programme.

                  <p>Simulations are of 56 million individuals, performed separately for a grid of values across a two-dimensional grid of 1) prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 at which lockdown was implemented (y axis), and 2) reduction in daily contacts during lockdown (x-axis). Surface has been interpolated from a grid of values. Transmission parameters (infectious_rate) fixed to assume a doubling time of approximately 3.5 days. Red dots highlight those parameter sets with the smallest 5% error with observed data. Observed data are from the UK Governments COVID19 dashboard and the UK’s Office of National Statistics (seroprevalence).</p>

Each black dot is the slope of fitting a linear regression to log of daily simulated deaths (truncated to between the first 100 to 1000 deaths). The red line represents a fit of the form a(x-b)^c * exp(nu), where nu is a noise term, to these data. Each red dot gives the value of the parameter infectious_rate (in brackets) for a doubling time of 3 (7.1), 3.5 (5.8), and 4 (5.0) days respectively.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The manuscrit describe a new computing agent-based code to simulate pandemic evolution, and to study some non-pharmaceutical interventions impact on this pandemic evolution. This approach allow to include some complex phenomena, such as heterogeneous social interactions, impact of physical distancing on the contaminations, contact tracing, social interaction in schools, at home, public transport, etc. This open-source code is writtend in C with a Python interface to allow various interactions between the user and the code, and for results display.</p>
              <p>The authors are invited to add in the manuscrit some clarifications of the limitation of their model (~ line 391), and some precisions, as described bellow.</p>
              <p>- the authors use full randomized contact network to simulate public transports (line 157). What is the impact of such approach on "real" contacts, where people have some habits ? Is a partially-randomized network feasible ?</p>
              <p>- are the different interactions temporaly splitted to avoid overlap ? If no did you study the impact of the order of the different daily interaction computing on the evolution of the pandemy ?</p>
              <p>- line 206 : 65 millions people simuled by aggregating 65 simulation of 1 million people. Are 65 non-interactive simulations similar than a simulation of 65 M agent where everybody can interact with everybody ?</p>
              <p>- is an homogeneous spatialized distribution of people representative of real demographic distribution, where some regions are more dense than other ? (in particular for public transport and number of daily social interactions)</p>
              <p>- what are the data used for model calibration ? Number of death ?</p>
              <p>- line 270 : the lockdown is taken into account with a reduction of socials interactions of 71%. Is this value deduced to fit to the mesures or taken from a previous study ?</p>
              <p>- line 283 : did you deduce the probability of transmission with and without physical distancing ?</p>
              <p>- line 431 : every individual interact with each other every day. Same queestion than before : is this temporally splitted to avoid overlap contamination (A &lt;-&gt; B &lt;-&gt; C contribute each day of the contamination A &lt;-&gt; C) ?</p>
              <p>- line 504 : is the 2 factor used is deduced to fit to the observed data or is this documented ?</p>
              <p>- line 600 : is the code parallelized (OpenMP or MPI) ? Did he scales correctly (in term of computing time / number of agents, and in term of number of core used if paralelized) ?</p>
              <p>- line 600 : 1.7 Gb memory for 1 million agents means ~ 400 simple precision (or ~ 200 double-precision) values used per agent without contact tracing. What are the main memory consuption to need so much RAM ?</p>
              <p>- due to high stochastic characteristics of a pandemy evolution (due to the random contacts between agents, and the random contagion from an agent to another), did you study the reproductibility of the simulations, and the range of results obtained with exactly the same parameters ? Some others agent-based approach, which use fixed contact-network, can show a wide variation of the max number of infected people, only due to the random aspect of contagion at each social contact. A study on these variations needs to be added to the manuscrit (These effects are visible for initial conditions with low number of infected people). The results used for decisional help are they an average of many simulations, or only one-shot simulation, without any error bars due to the stochastics effects ? This clarification is imperative, and may need to balance the conclusions obtained by the simulation described in the manuscrit.</p>
              <p>- what are the initial conditions ? Some infected at t = 0 ? How many ?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The paper describes the implementation of an ABM for simulating the spread of Covid-19 within a population of up to 1 million people, although as it is described this number could be increased. Spreading occurs through both static and dynamic contact networks using statistics on contact patterns, which addresses the inhomogeneous spread in different age-groups. Also, disease progression and asymptomatic cases are modelled. The strength of the presented simulation model is the inclusion of a range of different prevention measures in addition to the classic NPIs for contact reduction. As this is a core advantage of this implementation, systematic assessment and testing of intervention strategies should be performed and discussed more deeply.</p>
              <p>• The authors state that the model is parameterized for the UK, however, the paper lacks information on the calibration and validation process and how well the model reproduces the historic epidemic curve and efficiency of actual NPIs.</p>
              <p>• The model seems to be able to reproduce the characteristics of a certain (?) time interval of the COVID epidemic in the UK. Line 229 "The model provides a good fit to UK data, correctly matching: the cumulative number of deaths; the magnitude of the peak in daily deaths; the timing of the peak in daily deaths to within a few days; and peak hospitalisation to within 25% of the recorded number" This could be supported with additional quantification of errors/correspondence in the comparison between real data and simulation results. How was this correspondence achieved? How good is the quality of fit compared with other models? Several times in the text the authors mention that the model (and parameters) were calibrated, but a description or discussion of the calibration approaches is not found in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>• The line "The model was run on a population of 65 million people with UK demographics, by aggregating 65 simulations of 1 million people. An infection was seeded and grew exponentially with a doubling time of 3.5 days." It should be described why does the model fits nevertheless? Based on the methods, the doubling time is a result of the simulation. This should be explained and why is it (?) constant?</p>
              <p>• Paragraphs with important "messages" should be revised thoroughly. To give a more or less random example in line 600 ff "Performance. The ABM for 1 million individuals takes approximately 3s per day to run…" It is described in the abstract, but missing at this point for what scenario and which time range. Such shortcomings can be resolved easily and can improve the quality of the paper to a large extent.</p>
              <p>• Evaluation of results of prevention measures is provided in supporting information only (see comments below). The analysis and assessment of interventions should be systematic with visual displays supporting a thorough discussion. In the current state, intervention scenarios are somehow treated as technical demonstrations.</p>
              <p>• The abstract description of the model is well written and insightful, but technical details and modelling decisions are not or provided. The appendix is very useful and the parameters are well described.</p>
              <p>• Even though established approaches in an agent-based simulation of epidemic spread and the state of the art (and its limitations as a motivation for the paper) should be recognized (if it is the goal of the paper to show the methodological improvement). The motivation for modelling decisions and assumptions should be discussed in the presentation of a simulation model. E.g. motivate the use of certain types of networks/graphs and probability distributions! What are the features of the specific mathematical concepts? Why are they suitable to model certain aspects?</p>
              <p>• The paper lacks technical details on implementation for assessing whether the efficiency claims hold, however as it is open source it is possible to review the code itself.</p>
              <p>• A technical overview of the implementation as a simulator/framework should be provided. E.g. what is an "object-oriented programming style"? To the knowledge of the reviewer, C is not an object-oriented programming language. What is the procedure for sampling a population? A description of the initialization phase would be helpful. How are individuals aggregated into households on a technical level? How are the networks sampled from data? This should be included despite the source code is publicly available and well documented.</p>
              <p>• In the discussion, a kind of outlook is included, which should be described in more detail. A focus is set on hospitals, but big importance on epidemiological modeling will be set on the possibility to include also pharmaceutical interventions like vaccination</p>
              <p>• How is the model dealing with "unreported cases"? As it is immanently clear, this aspect should be at least mentioned.</p>
              <p>The simulation model is of high quality and shows also high potential. But at the current state, the paper is a conceptual presentation of a simulation model but does not include or present interesting results on one of the three areas 1) epidemiology, 2) HCI and Usability, or 3) technical novelty. The paper should increase focus towards one of those directions. If the model can be adapted as easily as claimed by the authors the model could provide a good framework for additional research for the assessment of NPIs if the model is correctly parameterized for the addressed research question.</p>
              <p>Some of the figures in the manuscript look not very appealing. For instance, Fig1 could be supported by context if placed in the Methods section. The inclusion of parameters is important. All mathematical symbols should also be used in the parameter tables. It would be good to provide additional context to the parameter values with some of the supporting tables.</p>
              <p>The model is fully documented and is thoroughly tested. The formal testing framework (mentioned in line 358) could be described in more detail e.g. line 589 "The model codebase includes over 200 tests used to validate the model." What was included in the tests? How was validation implemented?</p>
              <p>Model descriptions and modelling process could be set concerning international standards or guidelines like "Modelling Good Research Practices of ISPOR-SMDM" (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109830151201652X" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109830151201652X</ext-link>) . For example "V-8 If using an agent-based model, thoroughly describe the rules governing the agents, the input parameter values, initial conditions, and all sub-models."</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This paper presents a detailed description of the OpenABM-Covid19 model, which is an agent-based COVID-19 transmission model informed by detailed data on contact networks and validated against data from the UK. As a methods paper, it does not include results per se, but rather illustrates the analyses the model can be used for.</p>
              <p>Overall, I found the paper to be exceptionally well written and clearly laid out. The model has been carefully conceived, and the use of modern software practices (testing, documentation, concern for adaptability, an easy-to-use Python user interface, etc.) make this study an exemplar for how such models should be developed and communicated. The following comments are mostly intended as nonbinding suggestions for improving the paper.</p>
              <p>p. 4, line 56: This could be interpreted to mean that the population size fixed at 1 million, rather than that 1 million is the default.</p>
              <p>p. 5, line 85: I'm not sure I understand how people who are contact-traced are themselves "protected" -- wouldn't they be contact traced following exposure to a known positive?</p>
              <p>p. 6, line 96: Quite a few groups have developed COVID ABMs; while a comprehensive literature review is probably beyond the scope of the introduction, additional citations of influential ABMs might help the reader better understand the modeling landscape. The following are suggestions only:</p>

              <p>* Blakeley et al., which was influential in Australian policy decisions (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2020/213/8/probability-6-week-lockdown-victoria-commencing-9-july-2020-achieving" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2020/213/8/probability-6-week-lockdown-victoria-commencing-9-july-2020-achieving</ext-link>)</p>

              <p>In addition, the specific claims about OpenABM-Covid19 in comparison to other models may not be entirely accurate. Rockett et al. and Bicher et al. used 23 million and 9 million agents, respectively, which are larger populations than are typically used in OpenABM-Covid19. In addition, my understanding is that Covasim's computational efficiency is comparable to OpenABM-Covid19 (1 second per 2 million person-days; see Fig. S6 of <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154765v4.full.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154765v4.full.pdf</ext-link>), and has also been designed with extensibility and ease of development in mind (e.g. 100 forks on GitHub). The authors are encouraged to rephrase in a way that emphasizes the strengths of OpenABM-Covid19 while also acknowledging the strengths (and weaknesses!) of other models. (Disclosure: I am one of the authors of Covasim.)</p>
              <p>p. 7, line 111: While I can see a (strong) argument for community and perhaps workplace contacts to be drawn from a negative binomial distribution, is this true of household and school contacts as well? We have found that overdispersion in infectiousness, rather than overdispersion in number of contacts, is the most important factor for driving superspreading events. If in your model the latter are alone sufficient to account for the observed distribution of secondary infections, this is an interesting finding!</p>
              <p>p. 8, line 139: Out of curiosity, is there any reason why this version cannot be considered 1.0? The codebase seems mature, tested, and documented, and the bulk of development seems to have been completed &gt;6 months ago, which would seem to exceed the threshold for a 1.0 release in most contexts. (Very minor point: the Python package installs as version 0.2, not 0.3.) While acknowledging that the software practices are light-years ahead of most models, I did find myself wishing for a changelog, at least for backwards-incompatible changes (i.e. if the same parameters would no longer run, or would give a different result).</p>
              <p>p. 10, Figure 2:</p>
              <p>1. For Fig. 2A, showing the three distributions separately might be easier to read (as is, it looks like some of them are negative).</p>
              <p>2. I am also surprised at how low the number "random" contacts are -- I assume this does not count the 50+ people one would be in "contact" with on the metro or at a grocery store.</p>
              <p>3. I didn't realize until getting to the Methods section that school students were included in the "occupation" network. This surprised me since school class sizes and workplace sizes tend to have fairly different distributions (the former having a larger mean and smaller variance than the latter). In addition, given the central importance of school closures as a COVID policy measure, including school networks explicitly would seem to be desirable. Unless this can be added quickly, it could be noted as a limitation of the model.</p>
              <p>p. 11, line 208: Typo, "day"</p>
              <p>p. 11, Fig. 4: Perhaps a few words could be said about how the model-derived IFR compares to empirical estimates, e.g. Ferguson et al. (which seems like it was used for some of the input parameters), O'Driscoll et al. (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2918-0" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2918-0</ext-link>), and/or Brazeau et al. (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-34-ifr" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-34-ifr</ext-link>). By eye at least, the match looks quite good (i.e., at least as consistent as these estimates are with each other), which is nice evidence for model validation.</p>
              <p>p. 13, Fig. 5:</p>
              <p>1. What process, if any, was used for calibrating the parameters to produce these outputs? It seems some relatively straightforward tuning would be able to produce a better fit (e.g., lowering the infection hospitalization rate; increasing the hospitalization mortality rate). But if no tuning was done at all to parameters, the fact that the parameter "priors" produce such a good fit is worth highlighting.</p>
              <p>2. X-axis labels are missing -- I assume this is days? If actual date labels could be used, it would make it easier to read.</p>
              <p>3. It would be interesting to know how well the model can fit the UK's 2nd and 3rd waves, but one can easily get lost in an infinite spiral of fitting the model to the latest data, so I would not consider doing this a requirement.</p>
              <p>4. Does the model produce estimates of diagnoses, and if so, would it be possible to see the projections for these as well?</p>
              <p>5. Some indication of uncertainty would be valuable -- stochastic uncertainty if not parametric uncertainty. I understand that this will be highly dependent on the number of seed infections used, however.</p>
              <p>6. The commit hash mentioned here does not match the previous one, even though this figure seems to be the central result of the paper. Does the previously mentioned commit hash refer to the IFR results? Would one get different results if running with a different commit hash (e.g., 536adae at the time of writing)?</p>
              <p>p. 18, line 365: If I'm not mistaken, it has recently become possible to run from R as well as Python? (Although this seems less well documented.) This might be worth mentioning given the large number of epidemiologists who use R.</p>
              <p>p. 20, line 394: It is also probably worth mentioning pharmaceutical interventions, since I see vaccination has also been recently implemented in the model.</p>
              <p>p. 20, line 403: I was surprised there was no mention in this paper of the contexts and applications OpenABM-Covid19 has been used for. I feel silly saying this, but citing <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.20184135v1" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.20184135v1</ext-link> would seem to be needed at minimum!</p>
              <p>p. 23, line 468: It sounds like some individuals are assigned a high daily number of contacts and persist with that number of contacts. It may be more realistic to redraw the number of contacts per person each day as well since superspreading events tend to happen at non-daily venues (e.g. churches, restaurants). However, this is unlikely to make much difference to the results. In addition, it would be interesting to see the distribution of primary vs. secondary cases, such how well the model matches the data that e.g. ~20% of people are responsible for ~80% of transmissions.</p>
              <p>p. 28, line 571: I am curious to know why it's claimed that the approach is object-oriented -- C is not generally considered an object-oriented programming language (<ext-link xlink:href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/113533/why-is-c-not-considered-an-object-oriented-language" ext-link-type="uri">https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/113533/why-is-c-not-considered-an-object-oriented-language</ext-link>). I see structs being used extensively to handle data of different types, but I don't see much use of pointers to functions being used to emulate class methods, for example, and as such it looks a bit more functional to me. (Of course, one could "just" recode the whole thing in C++!)</p>
              <p>p. 28, line 579: It might help to explain what SWIG is (I had to google it).</p>
              <p>p. 29, line 603: Is it possible to disable rebuilding the daily interaction network? I imagine this would increase performance by perhaps an order of magnitude, and can approximated as a larger network with lower transmission probabilities (i.e., 10 new contacts per day for 5 days each with a 1% transmission probability is virtually identical to 50 static contacts for 5 days with an 0.2% transmission probability -- given the wide uncertainty bounds of how many contacts should exist in the first place).</p>
              <p>p. 52, line 814: Perhaps consider a protected branch instead of a commit hash, e.g. <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/OpenABM-Covid19-model-paper/blob/ploscb/notebooks/example_digital_contact_tracing.ipynb" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/OpenABM-Covid19-model-paper/blob/ploscb/notebooks/example_digital_contact_tracing.ipynb</ext-link></p>

                <underline>Data Requirements:</underline>
              </p>
              <p>Please note that, as a condition of publication, PLOS' data policy requires that you make available all data used to draw the conclusions outlined in your manuscript. Data must be deposited in an appropriate repository, included within the body of the manuscript, or uploaded as supporting information. This includes all numerical values that were used to generate graphs, histograms etc.. For an example in PLOS Biology see here: <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001908#s5" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001908#s5</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>
                <underline>Reproducibility:</underline>
              </p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, PLOS recommends that you deposit laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future.

              <p>Dear Bulas Cruz,</p>
              <p>We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript 'OpenABM-Covid19 - an agent-based model for non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 including contact tracing' has been provisionally accepted for publication in PLOS Computational Biology.</p>
              <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. A member of our team will be in touch with a set of requests.</p>
              <p>Please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes, so a swift response is appreciated.</p>
              <p>IMPORTANT: The editorial review process is now complete. PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling, formatting or significant scientific errors from this point onwards. Requests for major changes, or any which affect the scientific understanding of your work, will cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript.</p>
              <p>Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us now if you or your institution is planning to press release the article. All press must be co-ordinated with PLOS.</p>
              <p>Thank you again for supporting Open Access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Computational Biology. </p>
              <p>Best regards,</p>
              <p>Benjamin Muir Althouse</p>

              </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The new version answer all my questions.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Thank you very much for dealing with our comments. I think all important aspects have been adressed and changes have been implemented.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The authors have done an excellent job responding to all points. I was especially pleased to see the changes related to the code, including the performance section and the vaccination interventions.</p>
              <p>**********</p>

                <bold>Have the authors made all data and (if applicable) computational code underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/materials-and-software-sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data and code underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data and code should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data or code —e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
