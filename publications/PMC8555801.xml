              <abstract>
                <p>When pharmaceutical interventions are unavailable to deal with an epidemic outbreak, adequate management of communication strategies can be key to reduce the contagion risks. On the one hand, accessibility to trustworthy and timely information, whilst on the other, the adoption of preventive behaviors may be both crucial. However, despite the abundance of communication strategies, their effectiveness has been scarcely evaluated or merely circumscribed to the scrutiny of public affairs. To study the influence of communication strategies on the spreading dynamics of an infectious disease, we implemented a susceptible-exposed-infected-removed-dead (SEIRD) epidemiological model, using an agent-based approach. Agents in our systems can obtain information modulating their behavior from two sources: (i) through the local interaction with other neighboring agents and, (ii) from a central entity delivering information with a certain periodicity. In doing so, we highlight how global information delivered from a central entity can reduce the impact of an infectious disease and how informing even a small fraction of the population has a remarkable impact, when compared to not informing the population at all. Moreover, having a scheme of delivering daily messages makes a stark difference on the reduction of cases, compared to the other evaluated strategies, denoting that daily delivery of information produces the largest decrease in the number of cases. Furthermore, when the information spreading relies only on local interactions between agents, and no central entity takes actions along the dynamics, then the epidemic spreading is virtually independent of the initial amount of informed agents. On top of that, we found that local communication plays an important role in an intermediate regime where information coming from a central entity is scarce. As a whole, our results highlight the importance of proper communication strategies, both accurate and daily, to tackle epidemic outbreaks.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The spread of infectious diseases is nowadays an important health issue worldwide, killing about 8.5 million people yearly [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. More recently, the broad and diverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world has demonstrated that human behavior [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and communication [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] are both key components in the propagation, control [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0257995.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and mitigation of epidemics [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], specially in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions. Despite this certainty, the actual relationship between communication and human behavior still remains unclear. For instance, questions such as <italic toggle="yes">Which would be the reaction of a certain population during the spread of an epidemic disease?</italic> seems to depend strongly on both sociological and communication factors [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], among others, making the problem extremely complex to tackle. Therefore, it appears to be essential to integrate socio-cultural factors along with epidemiological models, in order to accurately describe the temporal evolution of an epidemic.</p>
              <p>Previous contributions focused on how media [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and information [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] affects the spread of infectious diseases, (for detailed systematic reviews please refer to [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]). Main conclusions from this research area are summarized as follow: (i) human response depends on the specific disease being dispersed together with social, cultural, political, and economic factors characterizing the population in which the disease spread; (ii) appropriate data is required to identify human behaviours that are key to regulate the spread of the disease; (iii) agent models are suitable tools to study the effect of behavioral changes on a population under an epidemic situation; and (iv), social media and massive data strategies should be both considered at the moment of fitting and feeding models with real data [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, an interesting emerging concept is the existence of a “Behavioral Immune System” [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], describing how the adoption of preventive behaviors could help people to reduce their probability of resulting infected during an epidemic. Notably, while vaccine coverage to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic remains low, particularly for developing countries, the existence of an actual Behavioral Immune System in the population is one of the best protective front lines we can rely on.</p>
              <p>An interesting approach relating communication with the spreading of an infectious disease was proposed by Funk et al. in 2009 [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], by introducing the concept of “<italic toggle="yes">awareness</italic>” as a mathematical association between agents’s proximity and their susceptibility to the infection. In doing so, the authors formulated a mathematical model describing how awareness spreads in population, coupled to an SEIR epidemiological model. Funk’s model assumes that: (i) awareness is a positive-definite function of time and depends on how information’s quality is distributed among susceptible individuals at a given time; (ii) information’s quality decays in time unless agents get exposed to new sources of information of higher quality and also decays when it is transferred from one person to another; (iii) information sources can be of local or global nature, and they can conduce to a variety of different preventive measures adopted by agents. However, the epidemiological consequence in the system is the same in all cases: a reduction in the infection rate, independent from any information strategy. Using this scheme, the authors argued that self-initiated reactions made by individuals under the influence of a certain degree of awareness can be crucial to the epidemic fate. Interestingly, they observe that a disease can be completely stopped from spreading, only if the population awareness diminish the basic reproductive number of disease, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub>0</sub>, below a certain threshold.</p>
              <p>In this work, we push forward these ideas to investigate how different communication strategies, extending from local to global ones, may produce a quantifiable effect in the outcome of the spreading of an infectious disease. Throughout an exhaustive numerical analysis, we compare populations having different characteristics when adopting preventive measures based on the situational awareness. To do so, we relied on an agent-based model (ABM) framework in which the infection propagates through a host population, from agent to agent, following a probabilistic process that depends on both the agents’ proximity and their situational awareness about the disease. Furthermore, agents can acquired information along time either from an agent-to-agent interaction or from a central entity, reducing temporally their disease susceptibility, following the same logic as in the model proposed by Funk et al.</p>
              <p>Our results suggest that informing a small fraction of the population has a remarkable impact on the spread of the disease, compared to a situation where the population is not informed at all. Moreover, communication strategies relying on a daily basis largely outperform the delivery of promptly information, delivered as soon as the disease spreads. Of note, our models also suggest that the initial number of informed agents is irrelevant to the outcome of an epidemic when information is not replenished over time. On top of that, communication between agents plays a crucial role, for some societies, when information is scarcely replenished, becoming irrelevant when large amount of information is available on a periodic basis, from a central entity.</p>

              <title>Materials and methods</title>
              <p>This section is divided in two parts. First, we introduce and contextualize our model, without mathematical nor computational technicalities, instead we provide a discussion focused on the learning that the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, left us. This discussion is carried out with special emphasis in the interplay between the propagation of a disease and communication factors in a society. Then, we go through the details of our model, discussing its applicability and limitations.</p>
              <sec id="sec003">
                <title>An SEIRD epidemiological model with communication</title>
                <p>Among all possible infectious diseases, we decided to use the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in this study for several reasons. Even though we are in the middle of a COVID-19 pandemic, and considering the worldwide context it would have made more sense to work in those lines, our understanding about EVD is fare more mature than that of COVID-19. Moreover, a vast literature regarding the dynamics of EVD has been published since 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], arriving to a certain degree of consensus about fundamental characteristics of this disease such as its spreading, lethality and mortality, basic and time-dependant reproductive numbers, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub>, respectively, having an <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub>0</sub> for Ebola virus within the interval 1.51–2.53 [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0257995.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0257995.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The latter is extremely relevant for us, as our intention is to explore cases where, due to the action of exchanging information, the result is a feasible reduction of the disease’s negative impact in the population. In other words, this can be interpreted as the possibility of modulating <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> by means of a strategy of information delivery, reaching a <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> &lt; 1 at some point along the simulation.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the extreme symptoms of EVD and the sociological impact of its outbreaks can lead to undesired social behaviors from both authorities and the population such as fear, discrimination, overreaction in the implementation of public policies, and the rejection of scientific evidence. Examples of these anomalous behaviors are extensively discussed in [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0257995.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], showing why considering human behavior, and not only epidemiological factors, is essential to understand the dynamics of the spreading of infectious diseases. Of note, previous EVD outbreaks were successfully controlled by implementing public policies that helped to prevent contagion [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Thankfully, the situation can potentially change now, as there are two EVD vaccines that were approved between 2019 and 2020 for the Zaire strain: rVSV-ZEBOV approved by the FDA [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0257995.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo which was approved by the European Union [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0257995.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, considering the case of the current COVID-19 pandemic, and moreover future epidemics, producing models to study how non-pharmaceutical interventions based on communication strategies may impact on the spreading of infectious diseases, is crucial.</p>
                <p>When it comes to modelling the dynamics of an epidemic, the compartmental models, first proposed by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], have shown their success and flexibility. Under this scheme, individuals are assigned to specific compartments depending on their current epidemiological state, and they can transit from one compartment to another along time, depending on the specific disease and dynamics. Common compartments are <italic toggle="yes">Susceptible</italic> (S), <italic toggle="yes">Infected</italic> (I), and <italic toggle="yes">Removed</italic> (R), among others. Using these elements as building blocks we may assemble a variety of epidemiological models such as the SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) or the SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) models. The former has been used to describe diseases such as the common cold or influenza [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0257995.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], whilst the latter to describe, for instance, measles [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0257995.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. When modeling the EVD dynamics, the SEIRD model has shown to have good agreement with real data [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0257995.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Here, the E and D compartments stand for <italic toggle="yes">Exposed</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Dead</italic>, respectively. Including these compartments explicitly defines an incubation period—i.e. defined as exposed state E—and, unlike other diseases, that susceptible individuals can still get infected with EVD through the contact with dead individuals, if no proper precautions are taken into consideration. Notably, despite controversy, this seems to be also the case of the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p>
                <p>Finally, to implement a model in which we may study the influence of communication strategies on the spread of EVD, we followed the approach proposed by Funk et al. [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], assuming that only trustworthy information is present in the system. Despite that the existence and importance of unreliable information, particularly in the form of <italic toggle="yes">fake-news</italic>, has been widely discussed [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0257995.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], we decided to focus only in reliable information as a first approach. Thus, the influence of fake-news during the spread of epidemic diseases, will be explored elsewhere. As a consequence, considering only truthful information implies that individuals having information are less likely to get infected than that of the ones without information. In our model, information can spread by three mechanisms: i) we consider that individuals can acquire information from a central entity corresponding to a global source of information; ii) through individual-individual interaction, which is a local source; and iii) when agents get infected and hence, they become informed. Of note, under this approach, individuals can affect each other not only from the epidemiological point of view –i.e. transmitting the disease–, but also because they disseminate information in the system. In the following section, we extend these ideas into a more technical and mathematical description of our model and simulations.</p>

It supports agent dynamics embedded in space, which makes it ideal for simulations in epidemiology when the dependency for the spreading dynamics on the spatial proximity between agents, is a desired characteristic [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p>
                <p>In our simulations, an agent is characterized by the parameters <italic toggle="yes">z</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>, and <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>, where <italic toggle="yes">z</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> denotes the agent’s position in space, <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> denotes its epidemiological state, and <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> denotes its information state. The suffix <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> denotes the <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>th agent. For simplicity, we assumed that each agent moves in a 2-torus (a 2D space with periodic boundary conditions) following a 2-D random walk (with unitary steps following random directions) and without affecting or being affected by other agents, at least in terms of its spatial dynamics. In other words, they diffuse all over the space in such a way that the probability of finding any agent in any position of space for a sufficiently long simulation time converges to a uniform distribution. It is worth noting that, even though this is true theoretically speaking, in the limit of <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> → ∞, we are far away from that limit given that we explore at most 1000 days of simulation time.</p>
                <p>Agents were uniformly distributed in the 2-torus space at the start of the simulation. To define proximity between agents, we have divided the 2-torus into 103 × 103 square patches of length size equal to 1. This leads to a grid-like space in which both epidemiological interactions and information exchange occur only between agents within the same patch. These interactions happen at rates which are modulated by the spatial density of agents. Thus, the number of total patches was selected to define a rate of interactions so to adjust our ABM to the results of the SEIRD model based on ODEs proposed to explain the EVD dynamics by Weitz and Dushoff [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. For a deeper dive into the SEIRD model, see <xref rid="pone.0257995.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Eq</xref>. The comparison between the results of our ABM model against the ODE model is shown in <xref rid="pone.0257995.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.</p>
                <p>The epidemiological dynamics of the simulation has two parts: an infection dynamics and a transition dynamics. In general, agents can be in any of the five epidemiological states, i.e. <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> ∈ {<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">D</italic>}, however, depending on their particular state their dynamics will be of one type or the other. It is worth noting that, <italic toggle="yes">S</italic> and S represent the susceptible epidemiological state and the susceptible compartment, respectively. The same occurs for the other states and compartments. Importantly, the infection dynamic occurs when a pair of agents susceptible-infected or susceptible-dead is simultaneously found at the same patch. Then, following a probabilistic process, guided by a Montecarlo algorithm, the susceptible agent may suffer a transition from <italic toggle="yes">S</italic> to <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>, which we will denote from now and on by <italic toggle="yes">S</italic> → <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>, or it may remain in the <italic toggle="yes">S</italic> state. In practice, when one susceptible agent or multiples susceptible agents encounter either an infected or a death agent in the same patch at the same time, we resolve the Montecarlo step by sampling a random number <italic toggle="yes">ν</italic> from a uniform distribution <inline-formula id="pone.0257995.e001"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0257995.e001.jpg" id="pone.0257995.e001g" position="anchor"/><mml:math id="M1" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">U</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>. Then, we compare <italic toggle="yes">ν</italic> with <italic toggle="yes">β</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">I</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></sub> (1 − <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>) &lt; 1 for each susceptible agent in the patch to resolve the infection: if <italic toggle="yes">ν</italic> &lt; <italic toggle="yes">β</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">I</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></sub> (1 − <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>), then the susceptible agent gets exposed. <italic toggle="yes">β</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">I</italic></sub> and <italic toggle="yes">β</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">D</italic></sub> are the infection rates for transitions <italic toggle="yes">S</italic> → <italic toggle="yes">E</italic> due to the action of <italic toggle="yes">I</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">D</italic>, respectively, when there is absence of information in the system. These parameters were extracted from reference [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and they are specific for the 2014–2016 EVD outbreak (these are provided in <xref rid="pone.0257995.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Of note, the term <italic toggle="yes">β</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">I</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></sub> (1 − <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>) contains the dependency of the <italic toggle="yes">information state</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>. This is actually the modification to the infection rates suggested by Funk el. al [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and the one we adopt in this article, to couple the communication dynamics to the infection dynamics. Furthermore, since the mean density of agents per patch is approximately 0.94, then the interactions along the simulation are basically pair-wise, this will be also true for the communication dynamics between agents.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the transition dynamic occurs when agents are in any of the epidemiological states but susceptible. In those cases the transitions are <italic toggle="yes">E</italic> → <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I</italic> → <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I</italic> → <italic toggle="yes">D</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">D</italic> → ∅. The former and the latter occur in a totally deterministic fashion, after <italic toggle="yes">T</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">E</italic></sub> and <italic toggle="yes">T</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">D</italic></sub> days respectively. However, <italic toggle="yes">I</italic> → <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">I</italic> → <italic toggle="yes">D</italic> occur both after <italic toggle="yes">T</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">I</italic></sub> days but at rate 1 − <italic toggle="yes">f</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">f</italic>, respectively. The empty state is represented by ∅, and <italic toggle="yes">D</italic> → ∅ symbolizes that the agents are being removed from the simulation, which in most of the cases, accounts for a person being buried. All these parameters were also obtained from [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and are provided in <xref rid="pone.0257995.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>.</p>
                <p>The <italic toggle="yes">information state</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> ∈ [0, 1] accounts for the information that an agent <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> has about the epidemic at a given time. Whilst <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> = 0 indicates that agent <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> is completely unaware of the epidemic, when <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> = 1, agent <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> becomes completely aware of the epidemic and the state of its environment, knowing exactly how to prevent the infection. We consider <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> as a function of time given by <inline-formula id="pone.0257995.e002"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0257995.e002.jpg" id="pone.0257995.e002g" position="anchor"/><mml:math id="M2" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, where <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> ∈ [0, 1] is the <italic toggle="yes">awareness decay constant</italic> of agent <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>. On the other hand, <inline-formula id="pone.0257995.e003"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0257995.e003.jpg" id="pone.0257995.e003g" position="anchor"/><mml:math id="M3" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> is the <italic toggle="yes">information quality constant</italic> of agent <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>, which is also a function of time, being <italic toggle="yes">q</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) = 0 the maximum information quality. Importantly, each agent has its own awareness decay constant that is sampled from a certain distribution <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>). This sampling procedure introduces heterogeneity into the system in the sense that every agent may follow a different trajectory along the simulation not only due to the stochastic nature of the Montecarlo simulation, but also influenced by their own awareness. Let us say, we want to apply this model to describe the evolution of an epidemic in a certain society, we state that <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>) should be somehow assembled by considering sociological, economic, political, and cultural elements, among others, of that specific society. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no clear theory that could help us to infer the proper <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>) based on the actual relationship among all those factors. Still, for simplicity, we can assume that <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>) exists, expecting that societies with higher trust, either between each other, the institutions, or the communications media, will have a tendency to have a higher degree of awareness and for longer times, than that of societies with lower trust, particularly when they are exposed to valuable information on how to deal with the spreading of an infectious disease.</p>
                <p>The information quality constant <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) has a very interesting dynamics. Counter-intuitively, as mentioned before, maximum information quality is reached when <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) = 0, which makes <italic toggle="yes">β</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">I</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></sub> (1 − <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>) to vanish resulting in a form of Behavioral Immune System for that agent, at least during that time step. As stated before, new information can be gathered by agents through three different sources: i) through the action of a global source that periodically feeds information into the system, setting <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) = 0 for all the informed agents; ii) from direct contact with agents in the same patch having information of higher quality, setting <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) = <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">j</italic></sub>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) + 1; or by iii) acquiring the disease, in which case the exposed agent gets informed when receiving the virus, setting <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) = 0. Furthermore, information quality degrades in time, one unit per time iteration. Thus, for the case of <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> + 1, i.e. when a time unit goes by in the simulation, and according to the previous paragraph, the information quality constant of an agent <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> can turn into:

Of note, when agents <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">j</italic> interact, information transfer from an agent with higher quality to an agent with lower quality occurs, and simultaneously, a time unit goes by in the simulation. Hence, we add one unit because of communication and one unit because time goes by, resulting in <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic> + 1) = <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">j</italic></sub>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) + 2. As expected, communication between agents only occurs if both agents are alive. A schematic representation of our ABM is shown in <xref rid="pone.0257995.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, where we show graphically most of the aforementioned concepts.</p>

                <p>To account for the heterogeneity of space in the simulation, agents were located randomly in the grid following a uniform distribution.

Despite unbounded, we did set <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>(0) = 100 because it is a number representing low information quality such, when applied to <inline-formula id="pone.0257995.e005"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0257995.e005.jpg" id="pone.0257995.e005g" position="anchor"/><mml:math id="M5" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, it gives a result close to zero.

                <title>On the influence of homogeneity and heterogeneity of agents</title>
                <p>One of the main critiques to traditional ODE-based compartmental models is the restriction imposed by the well-mixed assumption where mass-action dynamics occur. Its equivalence in ABM is when we assume that all agents have the same characteristics, being uniformly distributed in the space, so they are chosen randomly at the moment of updating their epidemiological states. Several authors have discussed this issue suggesting that including heterogeneity is desirable when modeling the dynamics of epidemic outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0257995.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Heterogeneous and quenched mean-field theories using representations of the space-based on complex networks [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], can also be used to represent heterogeneity in dynamical systems. However, ABM models represent a straightforward way to deal with heterogeneity, since specific features that are unique to each agent can be individually associated. Furthermore, different types of spatial environments with heterogeneous features can be added into the system, for example transit of pedestrians or public gatherings in specific geometries, such as cities or neighbors. Another approach that has shown to be quite successful in this line is the use of complex networks, where nodes can represent either an individual or a group of them. In this context, it has being shown, for instance, that large fluctuations in connectivity between population networks, may strengthen the incidence of epidemic outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p>
                <p>We have in our simulation certain degree of heterogeneity given by the spatial dynamics: agents which start randomly distributed in the space and become spatially closer as the simulation goes by, are more likely to interact than those being distant apart. More importantly, we explored the effect of having homogeneous and heterogeneous societies, by considering both the information quality <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> that each agent has in the system, and different distributions of the awareness decay constant <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>). Of note, as <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> changes along simulation time following the interaction dynamics between agents, heterogeneity of information quality is expressed by the different distributions of <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> that may arise from the simulation. On the other hand, as the awareness decay constant <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> is defined as a parameter of the simulation, to enforce heterogeneity we sampled a distribution of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> considering that <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> ∈ [0, 1]. Hence, two options arise: i) the first one representing a homogeneous society, where all agents have the same awareness decay constant <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> = <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>, where <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> represents the mode of the distribution. Therefore, the decay constant for such a society could be formally described as sampling <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> from a delta distribution, given by

                <p>In order to characterize both the similarities and differences between the homogeneous and the heterogeneous cases, and considering the stochastic nature of the ABM, we executed a large number of simulations, evaluating the effect of different parameters of the system. We used a scheme where information is delivered from a central entity (global information) to a certain portion <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>, randomly selected, of the total population in every step of the simulation. Thus, we have a 2-D parameter space with (<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>) ∈ [0, 1] × [0, 1] and we systematically explore it by sampling (<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>) with steps <italic toggle="yes">dρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0.02 and <italic toggle="yes">dα</italic> = 0.1. For each point in the parameter space, we run 100 simulations lasting for 1000 simulation days each one, which adds up to a total of 56, 100 independent simulations for each case. We observe that after this extended simulation time, the system has virtually reached its equilibrium state, as can be noted by tracking the evolution of the number of susceptible agents along time. Specifically, we compute 〈<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>)〉, which is the ratio between the amount of susceptible agents and 10<sup>4</sup>, which is the total number of agents at the beginning of the simulation, at time <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> and averaged over 100 simulations. A comparison of 〈<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) &gt; as a function of time for three homogeneous and heterogeneous cases, marked with dotted and continuous lines, respectively, is presented in <xref rid="pone.0257995.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>. Selected points in the parameter space are labeled as A′ = (0.8, 0.7), B′ = (0.6, 0.5), and C′ = (0.1, 0.4). Whilst in A′, the disease is stopped right away from a very early stage of the propagation, on the other hand in both B′ and C′, the disease spreads over the population. We quantify the difference between the outcome of the homogeneous and the heterogeneous cases by computing,

where the superscript (1) and (2) denotes the difference between the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. For simplicity, from now on we will adopt the notation <inline-formula id="pone.0257995.e009"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0257995.e009.jpg" id="pone.0257995.e009g" position="anchor"/><mml:math id="M9" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, or simply <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub>, with suffix <italic toggle="yes">f</italic> and without the brackets 〈⋅〉, to indicates the value of 〈<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>)〉 at the end of the simulation, i.e. at <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> = 1000 [days]. The use of notation with superscript will be only in sections where multiple cases are discussed at once. In general, <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> is an interesting metric because it allows us to analyze the system at the equilibrium state. Furthermore, Δ is bounded by 0 and 1 and it represents a difference in terms of fraction of agents relative to 10<sup>4</sup> (initial total population). Its limiting values indicate that both cases are identical, when Δ = 0, or both cases are totally disparate, when Δ = 1. Remarkably, the outcomes of the simulations in cases A′ and C′ are quite similar, we have Δ &lt; 0.02, whilst in case B′ the difference increases and we have Δ ≈ 0.07. Now, we thoroughly explore Δ over the entire parameter space. In <xref rid="pone.0257995.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d</xref> we show how <inline-formula id="pone.0257995.e010"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0257995.e010.jpg" id="pone.0257995.e010g" position="anchor"/><mml:math id="M10" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> looks as a function of the parameters <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> in the heterogeneous case. From here we can analyze the effect of the parameters over the outcome of the system. The dark blue zone indicates the region where the disease spread is barely affected by the available information, contrary to what happens in the bright yellow region where the disease is under control. Extreme examples of societies for these two opposite scenarios are those with <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0 and <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 1, respectively. Additionally, in stark contrast to what our initial intuition could have told us, homogeneous and heterogeneous simulations are very similar for most of the parameter space, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0257995.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2e</xref>. Here, we can see that the major difference between the simulations is reached when there is very little information being delivered by the central entity, i.e. <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> → 0, but only in societies with a tendency towards <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> closer to 1, but not exactly 1. As <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> increases, Δ tends to decrease, however, this does not happen in a monotonic way for all values of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>. Instead, for some values of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> we observe first a subtle increase for small values of <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> and then a descending behavior.</p>
                <p>Overall, these results suggests that the heterogeneous component added by the distribution <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>2</sub>(<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>) into the simulation is not that relevant, at least in a large domain of the parameter space where its effect is marginal compared with choosing <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>). It is worth noting that if we could certainly test many distributions to investigate the equivalence of the system, a truncated Gaussian distribution is enough to prove that the system behaves similarly with a slight degree of heterogeneity. With a slight degree of heterogeneity, we refer to a distribution where not heavy tails are present. For this reason, in what follows on this article, we work only in homogeneous systems with <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>) = <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>) as described by <xref rid="pone.0257995.e006" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq (2)</xref>.</p>

                <title>Non-pharmaceutical strategies based on communications</title>
                <p>We now examine the impact of different communication strategies on the epidemic spreading. To do so, we rely on different patterns of information delivery from a central entity to a certain fraction <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> of the population. Hence, we study three different strategies, namely strategy I, II, and III. By following strategy I, we inform on a daily basis to a fraction <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> of the agents in the simulation, that is chosen randomly among the living agents, following a uniform distribution. In strategy II, we inform to the entire population, but contrary to the previous strategy, this happens every <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic> days. Finally, in strategy III, we inform on a daily basis to the entire population, only after <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> days have passed, since the beginning of the epidemic.</p>

However, at <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> = 600 [days] the system has virtually reached the equilibrium state.

We also present a control case, indicated by a dashed line at the bottom and a double asterisk symbol (**), for which no information at all is present in the system. In this case, we obtain a value of <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.16. We may recall that there are three mechanisms for the agents to acquire information: i) from agent to agent; ii) when agents acquire the disease and get informed, and the last one, iii) by agents acquiring information from a central entity. In the case of Strategy I, the first two mechanisms are always on, therefore, even when <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 0, agents may still have access to new information. Of note, the latter case may act as a control situation in which <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 1. We termed this case as the <italic toggle="yes">ideal</italic> situation considering the complexity involved in implementing such a strategy during a real epidemic—accounting for logistic and other factors. As expected, the ideal case has the best results in terms of reducing the impact of the epidemic for all values of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>. This case is highlighted with a single asterisk symbol (*) and appears on top of all the other more realistic cases.

                  <p>As expected, all curves <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> in <xref rid="pone.0257995.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> suffer a transition from a state where communication does not affect the epidemic spreading at all, for values of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> closer to 0, to a state where communication conduces to a complete suppression of the epidemic, stopping its spreading, for values of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> closer to 1. The way how these transitions occur for different values of <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>, however, is quite interesting and highly nontrivial. In all cases, we observe a type of generalized logistic behavior in the transitions. As a consequence of this transition, the effectiveness of the strategy depends strongly on the characteristic <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> of the society and, of course, the parameter <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>. For example, for societies with <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0.8 we have that if no actions are taken in terms of informing agents from any central entity, that means <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 0, then the effect is quite similar compare to the control double asterisk (see <xref rid="pone.0257995.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). On the contrary, if we inform as little as <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 0.1 of the total population, the increment in the amount of susceptible agents at the end of the simulation is considerable, having <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.59. When <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 0.3 we basically stop the epidemic from the beginning and <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.92 in this case, which is remarkable considering the small amount of agents being informed. Nonetheless, if we perform the same analysis but this time we consider <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0.2, the impact of the strategy is very limited, even if we have <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 1, which is the ideal case. The scenario at the end of the epidemic, in this case, is <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.28. In a more intermediate case, such as considering a society with <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0.5, the results are more sensitive to the variation of <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> over a larger range of parameters. In this case, for example, we can jump from <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.34, for <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 0.3, to <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.51, for <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 0.6, or to <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.69, for <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 0.9. As noted in <xref rid="pone.0257995.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>, there is an evident non-linear relationship between <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>. Particularly, we can see that our system behaves similarly for different values of <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> when <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> is close to 0.0 or close to 1.0, but for intermediate values of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>, the high non-linearity of the system arise, denoted by a higher difference for the <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> curves. When <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> is close to 0.0, all the population has a fast decay of awareness, and inversely, when <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> is close to 1.0 all the population have a slow decay of awareness, so the percentage of informed people <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> does not contribute substantially to the final size of the epidemic. Now, for an intermediate case of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>, there is not a clear predominance of the agents with fast decay of awareness or agents with slow decay of awareness, resulting in a substantial difference when informed different fraction of population <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>.</p>
                  <p>This high variability in the results depending on the election of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> is not uncommon at all in these type of studies. The inference of the right parameters is one of the most difficult parts when trying to apply these type of models in a real situation. For this reason, the use of empirical data to feed models should be mandatory when a more concrete or applied analysis is required. However, everything is not lost and we can still use these models to learn valuable lessons and generate intuition.</p>

                  <title>Strategy II: Information every <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic> days to the entire population</title>
                  <p>We now turn to assess the impact that the periodicity of sending information could have on the spread of an infectious disease. In this strategy we have started informing on day 0, regarding the epidemic start day, and varied the number of elapsed days between consecutive messages. We started with a low periodicity, daily information delivery, and then we changed one day a time until completing the first week, then we tried with 2, 3 and 4 weeks of delay between messages from a central entity.</p>
                  <p>Results from this strategy are shown in <xref rid="pone.0257995.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>, where we can see how the distances between curves <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> decrease as we increase the period in which messages to the population are sent. We also highlight the difference between informing daily (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> shown by *) and informing each two days (orange curve), where we can notice the largest difference between consecutive <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub>. We can see this, for example, in societies with <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0.5, where if we have daily information delivery <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic> = 1 then <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.75, but if we increase the delay in one day, <italic toggle="yes">i.e</italic>., <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic> = 2, then <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.50, which indicates a difference in the final susceptible population of 0.25 between informing daily and each two days. If we see <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic> = 3, we have that <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.38, which is a difference in the final susceptible population of 0.12 comparing to <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic> = 2, which is less than half of the difference between <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic> = 1 and <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic> = 2. This result shows us that, as the periodicity of information increases, it becomes less relevant to delay or to advance one day the information delivery, being the largest difference between informing daily and each two days. To elaborate from another point of view on this conclusion, we include <xref rid="pone.0257995.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>, where the final number of susceptible agents changes when the timescale of information, represented by <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic>, varies. Indeed, we can see in <xref rid="pone.0257995.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> a fast decay for the firsts <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic>, and then a slow decay, representing a kind of “long-tailed” decay, which denotes the importance of sending information with low periodicity—<italic toggle="yes">i.e</italic>. high frequency.</p>
                  <p>In literature, we find a similar work [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], that also focuses on the effects of sending periodic information to the population, denoted by authors as “pulsating campaigns”, under the assumption that there is a communication of the <italic toggle="yes">risk</italic> towards people, which fulfills a role similar to awareness in our work. Their conclusion regarding this type of campaign is that it is better a pulsating campaign instead of a campaign where the people are informed constantly, all this under an oscillatory dynamics of infection, <italic toggle="yes">i.e</italic>. where the infected cases grow, decay, and then repeat this dynamic. They explain this result as a consequence of an abrupt increase in risk communication when starting a campaign. Despite is not possible a direct comparison, as we don’t have oscillatory dynamics of infection, we can make some assumptions, for instance, that if we had oscillatory infection dynamics, we probably wouldn’t have some abruptly increase of awareness (doing a simile with risk definition), and due to this, contrary to [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], it is probable that a continuous strategy would be better in our model (shorter periods are better for the population in our model). Without a doubt, delving into these types of strategies can show us optimal ways to reduce infections.</p>
                  <p>In summary, our results show that the best strategy to achieve a significant reduction in the number of infected agents at the end of the simulation, is to inform daily. Although this result seems obvious, we have shown that the impact of informing with a period larger than one day is very severe, conducing to a dramatic increment in the amount of infected agents at the end of the simulation for most of the scenarios.</p>

                  <title>Strategy III: Daily information to the entire population after <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> days</title>
                  <p>Another interesting question we want to address is: how much the delay in implementing the information strategy may affect the impact of the epidemic? In other words, we would like to figure out what happens when the information strategy includes a delay between the starting of the epidemics and the delivery of information to the population. To answer this question we changed from 0 to 90 days, each 10 days, the start day of the information delivery. To be consistent with the previous findings, after the information strategy started, we delivered information on a daily basis. Results from this strategy are shown in <xref rid="pone.0257995.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref>, where considering a delay of <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> = 0 and <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> = 10 the resulting curves are very close, indicating that it is similar to start the information strategy on day zero, compared to starting it 10 days after the start of the epidemic. This effect becomes even clearer when comparing three different societies, <italic toggle="yes">i.e</italic>. three different <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>, through its different curves <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub>. To do so, we evaluated the curves resulting from a delay of <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> = 0 and <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> = 10. For <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0.2 there is a difference &lt;0.01 in the ratio of final susceptible agents, when <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0.5 the curves have a difference of 0.03, and when <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0.8 the difference is 0.02. As noted, all the numeric values are close to zero, which tells us how similar is the outcome of all these strategies. A similar situation becomes evident if we compare the curves for <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> = 0 and <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> = 20, where for the case of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0.2 the difference is &lt;0.01, while for the case of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0.5, the difference is 0.07, and for the case of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0.8, the difference is 0.04. These results show us that for <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> = 20 there is a subtle difference comparing to the ideal case of <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> = 0. Now, instead of comparing curves of delays <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic>, we compare different <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> for the same society. For societies with low values of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>, for example <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0.2, the final population of susceptible agents <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> is similar when applying different delays <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> in delivering the information: when <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> = 30, a final susceptible population of <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.25 is obtained, and when <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> = 60, a <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.28 is obtained, whereas for the case of <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> = 90, a value of <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.29 is obtained. These results highlight how similar are the responses of the system when considering different delays in information delivery. Of note, this difference become larger when we have societies with higher <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>, for example <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0.5, where we have that for the cases of <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> = 30, <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> = 60 and <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic> = 90, the final susceptible population is <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.45, <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.64 and <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub> ≈ 0.75, respectively.</p>
                  <p>With these results in mind, we may conclude that the delay in information delivery has less impact in the size of the epidemic for societies having <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> in the extremes, <italic toggle="yes">i.e</italic>. low and high values of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>.</p>
                  <p>When comparing these results with that of strategy II in which we evaluate the effect of the periodicity of information, we may argument that is more important to inform on a daily basis than starting the promptly, as-soon-as-possible, delivery of information to the population. It is worth noting that this result is consistent with the one presented in [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], where the authors discuss about the importance of the rate at which awareness programs are executed. This same strategy comparison is included in <xref rid="pone.0257995.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0257995.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Figs but from the point of view of cumulative dead agents and removed agents, respectively, which, in addition to reinforcing this conclusion, could help to better understand the impact of these results. For completeness, in the next subsection we proceed to compare the outcome of these three strategies.</p>

                  <title>Accessing the similarities between strategies</title>
                  <p>An interesting observation from <xref rid="pone.0257995.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> is that several curves <italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub>, as a function of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>, share a similar shape between them for different strategies. This leads to an interest from our part in quantifying this similarity and try to establish a kind of equivalence relation, between specific pairs obtained from different strategies. For example, by simple visual inspection one could be tempted to say that informing every <italic toggle="yes">X</italic> days to the entire population is more or less equivalent than informing every day to a <italic toggle="yes">Y</italic> portion of the total population. However, this equivalence immediately raises various questions. For instance, a fundamental one is how can we say that two curves are equivalent, or similar, in this context? To address this interesting question, we used a measure of the distance between two curves <inline-formula id="pone.0257995.e015"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0257995.e015.jpg" id="pone.0257995.e015g" position="anchor"/><mml:math id="M15" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="pone.0257995.e016"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0257995.e016.jpg" id="pone.0257995.e016g" position="anchor"/><mml:math id="M16" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> given by

where <italic toggle="yes">x</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">y</italic> symbolize the value of the parameters for the different strategies that we are comparing. To illustrate this, let us say that we are interested in comparing strategy II with strategy I for the parameters <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic> = 2 and <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 0.6. In this case, we have <italic toggle="yes">ζ</italic>(2, 0.6) = 0.17 where this number indicates the area between the two curves. The closer <italic toggle="yes">ζ</italic> is to zero, the closer the curves are to each other. We have observed that when <italic toggle="yes">ζ</italic> is less than 0.35 the two curves are virtually indistinguishable from each other and each of them is within the standard deviation of the other for almost all of the values of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>. We are now interested in solving a minimization problem for <italic toggle="yes">ζ</italic>, in which given a certain value of the parameter <italic toggle="yes">x</italic> for one strategy, we are interested in finding the value of the parameter <italic toggle="yes">y</italic> for another strategy, such that it minimizes <italic toggle="yes">ζ</italic>, i.e. there is no other value of <italic toggle="yes">y</italic> that gives a lower value for <italic toggle="yes">ζ</italic>. Some examples of pair of curves that minimize <italic toggle="yes">ζ</italic> are shown in <xref rid="pone.0257995.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref> for different strategies. Furthermore, we explore this in a systematic way and find a large collection of pairs (<italic toggle="yes">τ</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>), (<italic toggle="yes">τ</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic>), and (<italic toggle="yes">α</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">δ</italic>), which are summarized in <xref rid="pone.0257995.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Interestingly, when comparing strategy II with strategy I, we can find very similar results for the outcome of the epidemic for a large collection of parameters—for all the values of <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic> that we explored we were able to find a value of <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> such that it minimizes <italic toggle="yes">ζ</italic> and also holds the condition <italic toggle="yes">ζ</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">β</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>) &lt; 0.35. Therefore, we conclude that, independently on the value of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> for the society and under the assumptions of our simulations, informing to the entire population every 2 [days] conduces to similar results than informing to just a 0.60 of the population every day. On the same page, informing to the entire population every 3 [days] conduces to similar results than informing to just a 0.38 of the population every day. And so on, following the values in <xref rid="pone.0257995.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We would like to highlight now a point that is extremely valuable, and definitively it is something that should be worth to take into consideration when exploring communication strategies in a more practical scenario: <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> decays rather quickly as <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic> increases, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0257995.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. This remarks the notorious importance of keeping a well-informed population under a quite frequent scheme during an epidemic.</p>

                <title>On the impact of agents’s communication in the spread of an infectious disease</title>
                <p>Now we turn to explore the importance of communication between agents on the impact of the spread of an epidemic disease. To do so, we evaluated the impact of strategies focusing on encouraging agents’s communication to decrease the size of an epidemic.

                  <title>Assessing the impact of agents’s communication without the delivery of central information</title>
                  <p>First, we explore the impact on the epidemic when there is only communication between agents, without central information delivery. In other words, agents do not receive information from mass media/central entity, neither infected agents receive information when acquiring the virus. Therefore, the only source of information is the initial information that agents have at the beginning of the simulation. We have tested this strategy to determine if solely the communication between agents is capable to stop the spread of an infectious disease. To do so, we set the system with ratios 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 of the initial number of informed agents, allowing agents to communicate freely between them. Results in <xref rid="pone.0257995.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>, denote that the impact on the epidemic outcome of this strategy is meaningless, as the four curves appear overlapped. In other words, these results tell us that no matter how many agents are informed at the beginning of the epidemic, when central information is absent, the final size of the epidemic will not be affected.</p>

                      <p>(a) Only agents to agents communication without central information in the system is allowed, considering different proportions of the initial population informed: 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001. The four curves represent the final ratio of susceptible agents of a 600 [days] simulation when the mode of the awareness decay constant <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>, increases. Shaded areas represent the standard deviation for 100 simulations. The inset figure zooms in the interval <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> ∈ (0.70, 0.74) to graphically show how close to each other the curves actually are. (b) Evolution in time of susceptible agents for different values of <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> when central information is available. Continuous lines represent simulations where communication between agents is inactivated and dotted lines where communication is activated. (c) Density plot of the difference between systems where agents communication is inactivated and activated for different values of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> and <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>. For figures (b) and (c) the points A, B and C represent the pair (<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>) with values (0.8, 0.7), (0.7, 0.3) and (0.2, 0.2), respectively. (d) Difference between two systems, where in the first one agents communication is inactivated and the second one is activated, for different ratio of informed agents <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>. Different curves represent different <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>. Shadows areas represent the propagation of uncertainty (both systems have a standard deviation resulting from sampling 100 simulations, and because of this, we propagate the uncertainty of the difference between the systems).</p>

                  <p>Although is expected that this strategy is not effective, due to the fast decay of information quality in time, given by <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic> + 1) = <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) + 1, what it is surprising is that it has zero impact even when all population is informed at the beginning of the simulation. This result shows us that the initial information of the system has no impact on the output of an infectious disease when there is no central information being delivered to population. Of note, we may also say that a strategy relying purely on agents’s communication should not be enough to stop the spread of the disease, for most of the values of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>.</p>

                  <title>Encouraging communication between agents when there is central information delivery</title>
                  <p>Finally, we evaluated the impact on the dispersion of the epidemic when both agents to agents communication and central information are present. To do so, we compare the results of systems where no communication between agents is present with that of the system when communication between agents is activated. In all systems we included the delivery of information to agents once they acquire the virus have considered information to recently infected agents (they obtain information when they get infected). To illustrate the difference between these systems we have selected three points A, B and C that belong to the parameter space (<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>), as can be seen in <xref rid="pone.0257995.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref>. For each selected point, two curves are depicted: the continuous curve representing deactivated communication between agents and the dotted curve, representing activated communication between agents. We can see that for A and C the continuous and dotted curves are identical, but for B there are some differences, showing us that, in this point, communication between agents actually affects the output of the spread of the infectious disease. To further study this behavior, exploring in a systematic way the parameter space formed by (<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>), we created a density plot of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> and <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>, as seen in <xref rid="pone.0257995.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4c</xref>. In panel c), the difference between systems can be further accessed by relying on the color bar map. We can see that for a big portion of the space, communication between agents is almost irrelevant (dark blue zones), but there is a portion where it plays an important role, being A and C in the zone where agents communication is irrelevant and B being in the zone showing relevant differences. This interest zone where agents communication plays an important role is characterized for a high <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> and a low <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>, which could be interpreted as when there is little to non central information delivery (low values of <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>) and societies with a tendency towards <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> closer to 1, the communication between agents could help to decrease the size of an epidemic. Likewise, when there is medium to high central information delivery, this being around <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 0.45 and above, communication between agents becomes irrelevant, independently of the <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> of the society. For completeness, we show in more detail the zone of interest, ranging from <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0.5 to <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> = 0.9 and <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 0.0 to <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 1.0, in <xref rid="pone.0257995.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4d</xref> where we can see how the difference between systems with agents communication activated and deactivated change due to different <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> and <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>. We can clearly see a tendency that for higher <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> and lower <italic toggle="yes">α</italic>, larger is the difference between systems, decreasing when <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> increases. This again, show us that communication between agents become irrelevant when there is a high central delivery of information to population. As we are not capable, yet, to know the <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> for a society, we think that this strategy of encouraging agents communication should always be implemented, because if we are lucky enough of being implementing this strategy to a society with <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> close to 1, we will have a considerable impact in reducing the size of the epidemic. We think that this strategy of encouraging agents communication could be useful when there is limited access to public or massive information, as was the case of the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where the affected countries had limited access to mass communication [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Since the beginning of 2020 the world has been living under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, we dealt with the idea of using COVID-19 instead of EVD to study the influence of information on the spreading of an infectious disease. Despite the abundant COVID-19 related literature, to the best of our knowledge, still no consensus on both models and parameters successfully describing the COVID-19 dynamics has been reached [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Therefore, we decided to stick with EVD because the SEIRD model, using proper parameters, has proven to effectively describe the evolution of EVD in human populations [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
              <p>From a modeling perspective, EVD as well as other infectious diseases, share similar spreading principles that can be captured using compartmental models. Even though we presented results coupling information with the SEIRD model, this coupling could be possible using any other compartmental model. In this sense, our approach is somehow universal. For instance, if we wanted to apply our model to COVID-19, despite exhibiting a SEIRD-compatible dynamics, then the parameters should be set to the specific values of COVID-19 instead of EVD.</p>
              <p>To study the influence of different communication strategies on the spreading of infectious diseases such as EVD, we decided to use the ABM framework. This framework allows us to explore at an individual level, the coupling of information and the spreading of an infectious disease, evaluating the influence of global (i.e. central entity or mass media) and local (i.e. agents’ communication) information, assuming that awareness decays in time and information’s quality decays when it is transferred from one person to another.</p>
              <p>Our results show a remarkable difference in the impact of the epidemic when we compare a population not informed at all against a small fraction of informed population. Of note, our results show that it is preferable to have a communication strategy delivering daily messages than the delivery of prompt information, as soon as possible. Considering the dynamics of local communication, we show that the initial number of informed agents is irrelevant to the output of an epidemic when new information is not entering frequently into the system. Moreover, for some societies, local communication between agents plays an important role when the information entering into the system is scarce, becoming irrelevant when a large portion of information is regularly coming from a central entity.</p>
              <p>Regarding how our results can be associated with certain societies, we postulate that when <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> becomes close to 1, it should resemble societies with high trust. Of note, high trust societies tend to exhibit higher social capital, a beneficial characteristic that may lead not only to economic growth [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] but also to the effective suppression of the spread of an infectious disease. Probably, the most notable case is the Zero COVID strategy implemented by New Zealand and Australia [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], two countries that exhibit high trust [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. On the other hand, a <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub> close to 0, should represent societies with low trust such as Argentina [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. In this case, the impact on the size of the epidemic depending on the information delay is low due to the lack of agents trust in the central authorities.</p>
              <p>As a whole, our results quantify the impact of communication strategies in the spread of an infectious disease and also show the equivalences between, at first sight, different approaches considering both sources and frequency of delivery. We also paid emphasis to the role that communication between agents may play to determine the final size of an epidemic.</p>
              <p>An interesting unaddressed question that we will pursue in future work is to determine the influence of misinformation, or <italic toggle="yes">fake news</italic>, on the outcome of the pandemic. Previous works have shown that misinformation and information have notoriously different dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0257995.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]: misinformation spread faster and farther than information. Studying the behavioral modulation induced by misinformation could lead us to determine its effects on the population’s awareness and hence, its impact on the dispersion of infectious diseases.</p>
              <p>As a whole, this work helps to understand the effectiveness of communication strategies as non-pharmaceutical interventions to tackle epidemics. This knowledge can be lead to the implementation of evidence-based public policies focused on the adoption of preventive behaviors, which could ultimately lead to saving human lives.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Comments for PONE-D-21-09046</p>
              <p>This paper evaluates the effectiveness of social and communication factors within the population during an epidemic outbreak. The authors use an agent-based susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-dead (SEIRD), epidemiological model, focusing on simulation results to reach a series of conclusions about the effectiveness of population communication. The model is meaningful and the derivation of the main results sounds right. But it needs to be revised before the second-round consideration. Here are some comments for this manuscript.</p>
              <p>The summary says, “Moreover, having a scheme of delivering daily messages makes a stark different in most cases compare to any other type of strategies”. I suggest that the author express the differences mentioned here.</p>
              <p>This paper focuses on the impact of communication strategies on the outcome of the epidemic, so I believe that the simulation results should compare the dynamic changes of the five types of nodes in the system with or without a certain communication strategy, and only focusing on “Sf” may not be enough to illustrate the effectiveness of the strategy.</p>
              <p>Page 8, the author introduces the simulation results of the three non-drug treatment strategies respectively and writes in the abstract that the second strategy is different from the other strategies. However, the paper does not compare and explain the differences in the results caused by the three strategies. Therefore, I recommend that the authors discuss the differences in the conclusions reached under the three strategies.</p>
              <p>The manuscript has cited more than 70 references, many quotes are necessary, such as: page 1, line 6, 2-10; page 2, line 15,14-30; etc.</p>
              <p>The explanation of Equation (1) on Page 6 is not clear enough.</p>
              <p>Page 6, what’s the basis for setting the initial condition “qi(0)=100”? Please explain.</p>
              <p>Page 7, for homogeneous and heterogeneous societies, the author shows different distribution patterns through Equation (2) and Equation (3). What is the basis for doing so?</p>
              <p>What is the reason for this phenomenon “ for example, we can jump from , for ,to ,for , or to , for ” in the first paragraph on page 10? Besides, the description of specific curves in the figure is not clear enough. I recommend the author add the legend to all elements in the simulation diagram for reading.</p>
              <p>There is some voice, grammar, and other problems in the paper, which are suggested to be modified, for example,</p>
              <p>line 194, page 5, “Let us say, we wanted to apply this model to describe the evolution of an epidemic in a certain society, we state that…”. There are problems with tense inconsistencies and punctuation, please check.</p>
              <p>Line 171, page 5, “information state ρ_i” should be “information state r_i”，please check.</p>
              <p>Line 287, page 8, “in case B’’” should be “in case B”, please check punctuations.</p>
              <p>Some picture numbers don't match the text description. Such as “Fig 3d”, line 288, and “Fig 3e”, line 296, page 8. Please check.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript investigates a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-dead (SEIRD) model in homogeneous and heterogeneous populations combining epidemic spreading dynamics and information awareness. Different scenarios are investigated, with information coming from local interactions of agents, or from a central entity. One of the conclusions is that communication is a key to tackle epidemics, increasing the final number of susceptible individuals.</p>
              <p>The paper is well written and the introduction gives a very nice contextualization of the problem, starting with the COVID-19 situation and the current literature about epidemic spreading, its relationship with human behavior, and the need for data. The proposed model is based on the approach by Funk et al (2009) modeling the "awareness" to parametrize the susceptibility to infection. In this work, the authors investigate different strategies with an agent-based model framework in which agents can be informed with agent-agent interactions, or from a central source to reduce their infection susceptibility. The model has some limitations, such as the assumption that all information is trustworthy.</p>
              <p>To introduce the model, the authors discuss an application on the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in East Africa. Indeed, it is a very good example of the importance of communication to change human behavior when highly effective pharmaceutical interventions are not available. The authors compare different strategies and their equivalence in outcomes using parameters for Ebola. I have some concerns about specific details of the model and its results, although I believe they are correct according to the construction of the model.</p>
              <p>Major points:</p>
              <p>- lines 135-151: What is the initial position of agents? Uniformly distributed, and then following a 2D random walk in a 2D lattice with periodic conditions? Or do they start from similar positions?</p>
              <p>- lines 136,137,170,171,184,188,189: At the beginning, the "information state" is referred to as $r_i$. Later, $\\rho_i$ appears with the same name. In line 184 $r_i$ appears again as information state, and in lines 188-189 $\\rho_i$ is defined as "decay constant". It was quite confusing to understand what is the relationship between $r_i$, $\\rho_i$ and $q_i$ at first.</p>
              <p>- lines 150-151 and Fig S1: What are the ODE equations that were compared with the ABM?</p>
              <p>- line 212: The maximum quality of information happens with $q_i = 0$. I can understand $q_i = 1$ when the agent is exposed to a global information, and $q_i(t+1) = q_i(t) + 1$ in other cases (quality decays over time). However, when agents $i$ and $j$ interact, is there any particular reason to sum 2 to the highest quality among $i$ and $j$?</p>
              <p>- lines 225-232: Traditional ODE-based compartmental models assume a well-mixed population, but it is possible to build ODE equations considering heterogeneous mixing (see heterogeneous and quenched mean-field theories on complex networks, for example). It can be harder to write the equations and have the equivalence with ABMs, but it is not impossible.</p>
              <p>- line 252 and captions of Fig 2 and 4: For the truncated Gaussian distribution, $\\rho_m$ is defined as the mode of the distribution. However, in the caption of Fig 2, it is referred to as the median. The same happens in Fig 4.</p>
              <p>- lines 240-,303-307: The heterogeneity in the population is imposed by the decay constant distributions $p_1(\\rho)$ and $p_2(\\rho)$. When not truncated, the Gaussian is a homogeneous distribution (no heavy tails are present). Do the conclusions in lines 303-307 hold if other heavy-tailed distributions are tested, such as a Cauchy or other power-law distributions? I am not sure if the truncated Gaussian alone is enough to conclude this.</p>
              <p>- lines 240-,303-307: If the current results are for $\\rho_m$ as the mode, would not it be better to compare $p_{1,2}(\\rho)$ with the same average?</p>
              <p>- lines 356-358: "Opposite" in what sense? "then the results are opposite". I guess it is not the right word: the difference of $S_f$ is smaller, but not "opposite".</p>
              <p>- line 369 (Strategy II): I suggest to include a discussion on the difference between the time scale of the spreading dynamics and of the information spreading (with $\\tau$)</p>
              <p>- line 369 (Strategy II): How to contextualize these results with the ones of Phys. Rev. Research 2, 023181 (2020) [DOI:10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023181], in which they investigate the effect of pulsating campaigns?</p>
              <p>- lines 414-416: The curves delays are related to $\\delta$, not $\\tau$, right? "Now, instead of comparing curves of delays $\\tau$, we compare different $\\tau$ for the same societies".</p>
              <p>- line 482-: In this section, only communication between people is activated. It was not clear to me if the communication still happens when agents become infected, with $q_i(t+1) = 1$. This information is important to understand the results. If $q_i(t)$ is always increasing, it is expected that the outcome of this strategy is not effective.</p>
              <p>- general question 1: How to connect these results with social media? It is not a "centralized" entity but has huge importance in communication and can be an alternative when the campaigns from the central government are absent.</p>
              <p>- general question 2: What would happen to the results if a transition from R to S exists? In the case of COVID-19, for example, reinfection is possible, especially with the new variants.</p>
              <p>Minor points:</p>
              <p>- Fig S1: Why not use the ratio instead of percentage in the legend? If using percentage, it would be better to add an "%" sign.</p>
              <p>- Fig 2(d), 2(e), and 4(c) should have a label on the color bar.</p>
              <p>- line 287: Should be B' (not two primes)</p>
              <p>- lines 288,296: The reference should be Fig 2, not 3.</p>
              <p>- caption of Fig 3: It shows 1000 days of simulation, but the main text says 600 days</p>
              <p>- line 347: Is there any statistical analysis to conclude the similarity with a "Chapman-Richard function"?</p>
              <p>- lines 404-: If I am not mistaken, here the "difference" is between the curves for $S_f$, correct? That could be more clear.</p>

              <p>1 Comment: </p>
              <p>The summary says, “Moreover, having a scheme of delivering daily messages makes a stark different in most cases compare to any other type of strategies”. I suggest that the author express the differences mentioned here.</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing us towards this issue. We wanted to refer to the fact that sending daily messages resulted in the best outcome between all the evaluated strategies. Also, we have a typographical error: "different" should be "difference". Now we have corrected the abstract to be read: "Moreover, having a scheme of delivering daily messages makes a stark difference on the reduction of cases, compared to the other evaluated strategies, denoting that daily delivery of information produces the largest decrease in the number of cases."</p>
              <p>2 Comment:</p>
              <p>This paper focuses on the impact of communication strategies on the outcome of the epidemic, so I believe that the simulation results should compare the dynamic changes of the five types of nodes in the system with or without a certain communication strategy, and only focusing on “Sf” may not be enough to illustrate the effectiveness of the strategy.</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>This is an interesting issue raised by the reviewer. For completeness, we have added the simulation results for cumulative dead, and removed agents. It is worth noting that agents at the end of the simulation can be in three possible states: susceptible, removed, and dead. This information allows us to evaluate the final impact of the epidemic. Since the exposed and infected agents are both transient, becoming zero at the end of the simulation, we have avoided them. We have added this complementary analysis in "Supporting information", S3 Fig and S4 Fig. This is mentioned on page 20, line 510.</p>
              <p>3 Comment:</p>
              <p>Page 8, the author introduces the simulation results of the three non-drug treatment strategies respectively and writes in the abstract that the second strategy is different from the other strategies. However, the paper does not compare and explain the differences in the results caused by the three strategies.

              <p>We have an entire section called "Accessing the similarities between strategies" where we compare the applied strategies, describing when and how the evaluated strategies are equivalent. This section can be reviewed on page 20, line 515.</p>
              <p>4 Comment:</p>
              <p>The manuscript has cited more than 70 references, many quotes are necessary, such as: page 1, line 6, 2-10; page 2, line 15,14-30; etc.</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>We have corrected the references, disaggregating many of them, as suggested by the reviewer. On the other hand, there are still some joint references, as is the case on page 2, line 14, where all of the cited work is about how media and information affect the spread of infectious diseases. Importantly, no textual references were made in the document.</p>

              <p>The explanation of Equation (1) on Page 6 is not clear enough.</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>We thanks to the reviewer for rising this issue. Now we have expanded and ordered our explanation to make it clearer. We have changed the explanation starting on page 9, line 223. The new text is: "As stated before, new information can be gathered by agents through three different sources: i) through the action of a global source that periodically feeds information into the system, setting $q_i(t)=0$ for all the informed agents; ii) from direct contact with agents in the same patch having information of higher quality, setting $q_i(t)=q_j(t)+1$ ; or by iii) acquiring the disease, in which case the exposed agent gets informed when receiving the virus, setting $q_i(t)=0$. Furthermore, information quality degrades in time, one unit per time iteration. Thus, for the case of $t+1$, i.e. when a time unit goes by in the simulation, and according to the previous paragraph, the information quality constant of an agent $i$ can turn into:</p>
              <p>\\begin{equation}</p>
              <p> q_i(t+1) =\\begin{cases} </p>
              <p> 1 &amp; \\text{if either agent $i$ is exposed to global information}\\\\</p>
              <p> &amp; \\text{or agent $i$ is infected at time $t$}\\\\</p>
              <p> q_j(t)+2 &amp; \\text{if agents $i$ and $j$ interact and } q_j(t)&lt;q_i(t)\\\\</p>
              <p> q_i(t)+1 &amp; \\text{otherwise} </p>
              <p> \\end{cases}\\,.</p>
              <p>\\end{equation}</p>
              <p>Of note, when agents $i$ and $j$ interact, information transfer from an agent with higher quality to an agent with lower quality occurs, and simultaneously, a time unit goes by in the simulation. Hence, we add one unit because of communication and one unit because time goes by, resulting in $q_i(t+1)=q_j(t)+2$".</p>

              <p>Page 6, what’s the basis for setting the initial condition “qi(0)=100”? Please explain.</p>
              <p>Response: </p>
              <p>As denoted by the reviewer the explanation was missing in the text. Now the text, page 10, line 240, says: "Despite unbounded, we did set $q_i(0)=100$ because it is a number representing low information quality such, when applied to $r_i=\\rho^{q_i}$, it gives a result close to zero. In other words, when $q_i(0)=100$, for $\\rho \\in [0.1,0.9]$ the information state $r_i \\in [10^{-100}, 2\\times10^{-5}]$, meaning that agents have a negligible awareness of the pandemic situation."</p>
              <p>7 Comment:</p>
              <p>Page 7, for homogeneous and heterogeneous societies, the author shows different distribution patterns through Equation (2) and Equation (3). What is the basis for doing so?</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>The basis for doing so is to have both a homogeneous and a heterogeneous distribution for the decay constant $\\rho$. In doing so, we explored the impact of having different distributions of this parameter. To improve the clarity on this topic, we decided to change and expand our explanation. The resulting paragraph, on page 11, line 271, now is read: "More importantly, we explored the effect of having homogeneous and heterogeneous societies, by considering both the information quality $q_i$ that each agent has in the system, and different distributions of the awareness decay constant $p(\\rho)$. Of note, as $q_i$ changes along simulation time following the interaction dynamics between agents, heterogeneity of information quality is expressed by the different distributions of $q_i$ that may arise from the simulation. On the other hand, as the awareness decay constant $\\rho$ is defined as a parameter of the simulation, to enforce heterogeneity we sampled a distribution of $\\rho$ considering that $\\rho_i\\in[0,1]$. Hence, two options arise: i) the first one representing a homogeneous society, where all agents have the same awareness decay constant $\\rho_i = \\rho_m$, where $\\rho_m$ represents the mode of the distribution. Therefore, the decay constant for such a society could be formally described as sampling $\\rho_i$ from a delta distribution, given by</p>
              <p>\\begin{equation}</p>
              <p> p_{1}(\\rho) = \\delta(\\rho-\\rho_m)\\,,</p>
              <p>\\label{eq:delta}</p>
              <p>\\end{equation}</p>
              <p>where $\\delta$ is the Dirac delta and $\\rho_m$ represents its center. The second case corresponds to a ii) heterogeneous society, for which the decay constant can be obtained by sampling $\\rho_i$ from a truncated Gaussian distribution, given by</p>
              <p>\\begin{equation}</p>
              <p> p_2(\\rho) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi}}</p>
              <p> \\frac{e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\rho-\\rho_m}{\\sigma}\\right)^2} H(\\rho)H(1-\\rho)}{\\text{ erf}\\left[\\rho_m/\\sqrt{2}\\sigma\\right]-\\text{ erf}\\left[(\\rho_m-1)/\\sqrt{2}\\sigma\\right]}\\,.</p>
              <p>\\label{eq:gaussian}</p>
              <p>\\end{equation}</p>
              <p>In this case, $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the associated untruncated Gaussian distribution (which was chosen as $\\sigma=0.2$), $\\rho_m$ is the mode of the distribution, $H$ is the Heaviside step function, and $\\text{erf}$ is the Gauss error function. Examples of truncated Gaussian distributions $p_1$ and $p_2$ using different values of $\\rho_m$, are shown in panels (a) and (b) from Fig 2, respectively."</p>
              <p>8 Comment:</p>
              <p>What is the reason for this phenomenon “for example, we can jump from $S_{f}\\approx0.34$, for $\\alpha = 0.3$, to $S_{f}\\approx0.51$, for $\\alpha = 0.6$, or to $S_{f}\\approx0.69$, for $\\alpha = 0.9$” in the first paragraph on page 10? Besides, the description of specific curves in the figure is not clear enough. I recommend the author add the legend to all elements in the simulation diagram for reading.</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for rising this issue. It clearly deserves a deeper and better explanation. This phenomenon is due to the high non-linearity of the system, as can be read on page 17, line 410: "As noted in Fig 3a, there is an evident non-linear relationship between $\\alpha$ and $\\rho_m$. Particularly, we can see that our system behaves similarly for different values of $\\alpha$ when $\\rho_m$ is close to $0.0$ or close to $1.0$, but for intermediate values of $\\rho_m$, the high non-linearity of the system arise, denoted by a higher difference for the $\\alpha$ curves. When $\\rho_m$ is close to $0.0$, all the population have a fast decay of awareness, and inversely, when $\\rho_m$ is close to $1.0$ all the population have a slow decay of awareness, so the percentage of informed people $\\alpha$ does not contribute substantially to the final size of the epidemic. Now, for an intermediate case of $\\rho_m$, there is not a clear predominance of the agents with fast decay of awareness or agents with slow decay of awareness, resulting in a substantial difference when informed different fraction of population $\\alpha$." We have also added legends to the figures, as suggested by the reviewer.</p>

              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>The agents were uniformly distributed in the 2-torus space at the start of the simulation. A 2D lattice with periodic condition is a 2-torus, which is mentioned in the text. Anyway, we have added this explanation in the article for clarification, so now the text explains: "Agents were uniformly distributed in the 2-torus space at the start of the simulation." on page 7, line 157 and "...we assumed that each agent moves in a 2-torus (2D space with periodic boundary conditions)" on page 7, line 148. </p>

              <p>Response: </p>

              <p>4 Comment:</p>
              <p>line 212: The maximum quality of information happens with $q_i = 0$. I can understand $q_i = 1$ when the agent is exposed to a global information, and $q_i(t+1) = q_i(t) + 1$ in other cases (quality decays over time). However, when agents $i$ and $j$ interact, is there any particular reason to sum 2 to the highest quality among $i$ and $j$?</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer by noting this issue. The original text was confusing regarding this point, and yes, there is a reason to sum 2 to the agent that receives the information. We sum one unit when information is transferred from an agent with higher quality to an agent with lower quality, and we also sum one unit as one day goes by. As both processes occur simultaneously, we add 2 to the equation. We have improved our explanation in the manuscript for a better understanding. Now, in the text we have explained: "Of note, when agents $i$ and $j$ interact, information transfer from an agent with higher quality to an agent with lower quality occurs, and simultaneously, a time unit goes by in the simulation. Hence, we add one unit because of communication and one unit because time goes by, resulting in $q_i(t+1)=q_j(t)+2$.", which can be found on page 9, line 232.</p>

              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out overlooked methods. We have added the suggested information in the manuscript. We have added on page 11, line 257, the following: "Heterogeneous and quenched mean-field theories using representations of the space-based on complex networks [72], can also be used to represent heterogeneity in dynamical systems. However, ABM models represent a straightforward way to deal with heterogeneity, since specific features that are unique to each agent can be individually associated.". </p>

              <p>We thank to the by rising this notation error. $\\rho_m$ is indeed the mode of the distribution. We have fixed this.</p>

              <p>{lines 240-,303-307: The heterogeneity in the population is imposed by the decay constant distributions $p_1(\\rho)$ and $p_2(\\rho)$. When not truncated, the Gaussian is a homogeneous distribution (no heavy tails are present). Do the conclusions in lines 303-307 hold if other heavy-tailed distributions are tested, such as a Cauchy or other power-law distributions? I am not sure if the truncated Gaussian alone is enough to conclude this.</p>
              <p>Response: </p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting question. Our goal was to obtain a heterogeneous distribution centered in some specific value of $\\rho$, to then compare the resulting simulations with the results of a simulation with a delta distribution centered in that same $\\rho$. In this way, we investigated up to what extent our homogeneous system is similar to that of the heterogeneous distribution. Certainly, we could try different distributions to evaluate the equivalence between systems, but our objective is to show that, at least with a slight heterogeneity, the systems are equivalent. With a slight heterogeneity, we refer to a distribution where not heavy tails are present. Because of this, to compare a delta distribution against a truncated Gaussian distribution is enough to meet our requirements. We have greatly improved subsection "On the influence of homogeneity and heterogeneity of agents", to better convey this idea and also explicitly written on page 14, line 347, as follows: "It is worth noting that if we could certainly test many distributions to investigate the equivalence of the system, a truncated Gaussian distribution is enough to prove that the system behaves similarly with a slight degree of heterogeneity. With a slight degree of heterogeneity, we refer to a distribution where not heavy tails are present."</p>

              <p>lines 240-,303-307: If the current results are for $\\rho_m$ as the mode, would not it be better to compare $p_{1,2}(\\rho)$ with the same average?</p>
              <p>Response: </p>
              <p>We think that the mode is a better descriptor for a truncated Gaussian distribution, this is because, in a unimodal distribution, the mode represents a central representative value but with some distribution around it. We have added the explanation on page 12, line 290, as follow: "Importantly, we decided to use the mode of the truncated Gaussian distribution so to produce a distribution of $\\rho$ surrounding a central representative value $\\rho_m$, which can be understood as a delta distribution with lateral non-symmetrical diffusion, in both directions. As noted in Fig 2b, when producing a truncated Gaussian distribution of $\\rho$ using as center the $\\rho_m$ obtained from the Dirac delta (Fig 2a), three heterogeneous distributions of $\\rho$, denoted A, B and C, were produced. Whereas distribution A resembles a skewed right distribution, distribution C resembles a skewed left distribution." </p>

              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>In one case the strategy is very effective, in the other, very inefficient, because of that we say "opposite", but we agree with the reviewer that it is not the best word, because of that we have changed the redaction for a better understanding. Now, on page 16, line 404, we have: "Nonetheless, if we perform the same analysis but this time we consider $\\rho_m = 0.2$, the impact of the strategy is very limited, even if we have $\\alpha=1$, which is the ideal case.".</p>

              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for presenting this interesting article. Similar to our strategy II, the authors study the effect of pulsating campaigns, and compare it to a continuous campaign. We have added the following discussion on page 18, line 452: "In literature, we find a similar work [74], that also focuses on the effects of sending periodic information to the population, denoted by authors as "pulsating campaigns", under the assumption that there is a communication of the \\textit{risk} towards people, which fulfills a role similar to awareness in our work. Their conclusion regarding this type of campaign is that it is better a pulsating campaign instead of a campaign where the people are informed constantly, all this under an oscillatory dynamics of infection, \\textit{i.e.} where the infected cases grow, decay, and then repeat this dynamic. They explain this result as a consequence of an abrupt increase in risk communication when starting a campaign. Despite is not possible a direct comparison, as we don't have oscillatory dynamics of infection, we can make some assumptions, for instance, that if we had oscillatory infection dynamics, we probably wouldn't have some abruptly increase of awareness (doing a simile with risk definition), and due to this, contrary to [74], it is probable that a continuous strategy would be better in our model (shorter periods are better for the population in our model). Without a doubt, delving into these types of strategies can show us optimal ways to reduce infections."</p>

              <p>Yes, the curves are related to $\\delta$. We have fixed this, and now the text on page 19, line 492 reads: "Now, instead of comparing curves of delays $\\delta$, we compare different $\\delta$ for the same society."</p>

              <p>line 482-: In this section, only communication between people is activated. It was not clear to me if the communication still happens when agents become infected, with $q_i(t+1) = 1$. This information is important to understand the results. If $q_i(t)$ is always increasing, it is expected that the outcome of this strategy is not effective.</p>
              <p>Response: </p>
              <p> In this section, people who have been infected do not receive new information, and as the reviewer points out, $q_i(t)$ is always increasing. As the reviewer comments, the result of this strategy is expected to be ineffective, but it is not expected to have zero impact, even when the entire population is informed. We have clarified both points in the manuscript, the first one as: "First, we explore the impact on the epidemic when there is only communication between agents, without central information delivery. In other words, agents do not receive information from mass media/central entity, neither infected agents receive information when acquiring the virus. Therefore, the only source of information is the initial information that agents have at the beginning of the simulation.." on page 22, line 568. The second one has been modified as "Although is expected that this strategy is not effective, due to the decay of information quality in time, given by $q_i(t+1) = q_i(t)+1$, what it is surprising is that it has zero impact even when all population is informed at the beginning of the simulation.", on page 23, line 581.</p>
              <p>14 Comment:</p>
              <p>general question 1: How to connect these results with social media? It is not a "centralized" entity but has huge importance in communication and can be an alternative when the campaigns from the central government are absent.</p>
              <p>Response: </p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting question. Social media could be considered at the intersection between a central entity and people communication. Similar to central entity communication, it also has a huge impact and could reach a lot of people, and compared with people communication, it depends on agent connection network. It also has the characteristic that it is a media where we can find unreliable information, also knows as "fake news", which could lead to an interesting different dynamics, compared with a system where there is only trustworthy information. Despite this is an interesting topic, it is out of the scope of the present paper, but without any doubt, we will consider it for future work.</p>

              <p>general question 2: What would happen to the results if a transition from R to S exists? In the case of COVID-19, for example, reinfection is possible, especially with the new variants.</p>
              <p>Response: </p>
              <p>This is also a very interesting question, and we thank the reviewer for the comments. Despite what we can speculate, that the information strategies would decrease their effectiveness because the epidemic will last longer, and also that the system will show an oscillatory behavior, and probably the information received in certain infection wave could help to decrease the size of the next infection wave, this question is out of the scope of our work. Definitely, due to many interesting questions arising from this suggestion, we will consider it for future work. </p>

              <p>lines 288,296: The reference should be Fig 2, not 3.</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>The reviewer is right. We have fixed this mistake.</p>
              <p>Comment:</p>
              <p>caption of Fig 3: It shows 1000 days of simulation, but the main text says 600 days</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>It is 1000 days, it has been corrected. Around 600 days the system reaches an equilibrium state. Because of this we also have 2 plots that end in $t=600$. We have also added this explanation on page 15, line 366: "As we previously proceeded, in all three strategies we are interested in the outcome of the epidemic by evaluating the number of susceptible agents at the end of the simulation, \\textit{i.e.} at $t=1000$ [days]. However, at $t=600$ [days] the system has virtually reached the equilibrium state"</p>
              <p>Comment:</p>
              <p>line 347: Is there any statistical analysis to conclude the similarity with a "Chapman-Richard function"?</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>No, there is no statistical analysis to conclude this, this was a qualitative observation. We have decided to erase this from text, to avoid misunderstanding.</p>
              <p>Comment:</p>
              <p>lines 404-: If I am not mistaken, here the "difference" is between the curves for $S_f$, correct? That could be more clear.</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>Yes, the difference is between curves for $S_f$, but we are comparing different societies, which are represented by different $\\rho_i$. We have improved the explanation to avoid this misunderstanding. Now the text on page 19, line 483 is: "This effect becomes even clearer when comparing three different societies, \\textit{i.e.} three different $\\rho_m$, through its different curves $S_f$.</p>

              <p>Reviewer 1</p>
              <p>1- On page 5 of the article, line 77, the author mentions “Even though we</p>
              <p>are in the middle of a COVID-19 pandemic, and considering the worldwide context, it</p>
              <p>would have made more sense to work in those lines, our understanding about EVD is</p>
              <p>fare more mature than that of COVID-19”. So the article is based on the EVD virus to</p>
              <p>verify. However, the EVD virus and COVID-19 are significantly different in the</p>
              <p>incubation period and even fatality rate. How to prove the universality of the model?}</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>As mentioned by the reviewer, our article is based on the Ebola virus disease (EVD), which indeed behaves significantly different from COVID-19. However, from a modeling perspective, they both share similar spreading principles that can be captured using compartmental models. This is important because, even though we presented results that integrate the information phenomenon with the SEIRD model, this integration could have been accomplished using any other compartmental model, in this sense our approach is somehow universal. Nevertheless, we have worked with the SEIRD model because it has shown to be very effective at describing the evolution of EVD in a population, and also the EVD parameters, such as infection rates, incubation period, among others, are well described in the literature. Regarding COVID-19, the literature has not reached enough maturity and there is still no consensus in the community on the models and parameters that best describe its behavior. For this reason we decided to stick with EVD, nonetheless working with COVID-19 could have been more sounding.</p>
              <p>Regarding universality, as mention before, our results are based on EVD, and therefore, they should not be treated as universal, in the sense that cannot be transferred to other diseases directly. For instance, if one wanted to apply our model to COVID-19, despite exhibiting a SEIRD-compatible dynamics, then the parameters should be set to the specific values of COVID-19. For clarity we have added a paragraph in the conclusion, please see page 25, line 633.</p>
              <p>2- The picture with the legend provided by the author is not clear enough.</p>
              <p>At the same time, the author mentioned using the actual data of the Ebola virus for</p>
              <p>simulation before, but the article did not introduce how to deal with the data, so the</p>
              <p>conclusion obtained seems not credible.}</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>We assume that the reviewer is referring to Figure 1. If this is the case, we are not convinced that this figure requires an amendment, because it was intended to be a graphical representation of both the SEIRD model and the ABM dynamics. Therefore, from our point of view, in its current form, Figure 1 achieves its goal.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, as we describe in methods, page 7, line 162, and page 8, line 183, we did not use real data to fit our model. On the contrary, we extracted the EVD parameters from the literature and we used them to fit our ABM model results, to that of the ODE model proposed by Weitz and Dushoff. As seen in S1 Fig, by comparing the peak days and the values of the final states, we conclude that our ABM reproduces the dynamics of an ODE model for EVD, which is currently found in the literature. It is important to mention that our conclusions are not solely based on the parameters for the EVD extracted from the literature, but also from our implementation on ABM of the information model proposed by Funk et. al. By joining these models we highlight the importance of proper communication strategies, both accurate and daily, to tackle epidemic outbreaks.</p>
              <p>3- The evaluation of the effectiveness of information transmission in this</p>
              <p>paper can provide methods and strategies for the prevention of infectious diseases.</p>
              <p>However, the transition between the introduction and conclusion is relatively abrupt</p>
              <p>and inconsistent, so we suggest improving it.}</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>We thank to the reviewer by noting the inconsistency between the introduction and the conclusion. We made some changes to the conclusion, to make it more consistent with the introduction. The new version of the text can be read in page 25, line 655. Also, we added some minor changes, which are highlighted in the marked-up copy of our work.</p>
              <p>4- page 8, line 185, We note that you mentioned: “$r_i=0$</p>
              <p>indicates that the agent is completely unaware of the epidemics”. As for the form of information state</p>
              <p>function you set, with the time iteration in the system, the information quality will</p>
              <p>gradually improve, while the individuals in the system have a declining understanding</p>
              <p>of infectious diseases. We are puzzled about this, and hope the author can further</p>
              <p>explain it.}</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>Importantly, in our model, the information quality $q(t)$ will gradually decrease along time. The only way in which $q(t)$ increases is when the agents acquire new information from a central entity. As $r_i(t) = \\rho_i^{q_i(t)}$, when $q(t)=0$ the agents achieve the maximum state of information. Consistently, a higher value for $q(t)$ implies less information quality, resulting in $r_i$ close to zero. To avoid any misunderstanding in this complex topic, we have improved the explanation as follows: "Whilst $r_i = 0$ indicates that agent $i$ is completely unaware of the epidemic, when $r_i = 1$, agent $i$ becomes completely aware of the epidemic and the state of its environment, knowing exactly how to prevent the infection. We consider $r_i$ as a function of time given by $r_i(t) = \\rho_i^{q_i(t)}$, where $\\rho_i\\in[0,1]$ is the \\emph{awareness decay constant} of agent $i$. On the other hand, $q_i(t)\\in\\mathbb{N}$ is the \\emph{information quality constant} of agent $i$, which is also a function of time, being $q(t)=0$ the maximum information quality.", in page 8, line 200.</p>
              <p>5- This paper studies the influence of communication strategy based on the</p>
              <p>epidemic model, SEIRD. For this model, whether the system eventually approaches the</p>
              <p>disease-free equilibrium, namely</p>
              <p>$e_i = 0$, $i=0$, depends largely on its own threshold</p>
              <p>condition. We suggest that the communication strategy should be further explained in</p>
              <p>the light of the situation that the system tends to the endemic equilibrium.}</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>We appreciate this very interesting suggestion made by the reviewer. However, we consider it out of the scope of the present work and we certainly will pursue it in a future study.</p>
              <p>6- In sup Figure1, the final result of the SEIRD model under the ABM</p>
              <p>framework in (a) is not much different from that in Figure (b). Is it insufficient to</p>
              <p>support the conclusion that the communication strategy can effectively control the</p>
              <p>spread of the disease?}</p>
              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>In Sup Figure 1 we show two systems without information. We made a comparison between the ABM and the ODE systems to evaluate the consistency of our model with current literature. In other words, that we are capable to replicate with our ABM system the ODE dynamics extracted from literature. This ABM is the base system that later on is complemented with the information model. To avoid any misunderstanding we improved the caption as follows: "{\\bf ABM evaluation against the literature} (a) ABM, temporal evolution of the states of the system for 100 repetitions. The shaded area is the standard deviation. (b) Same model in deterministic ODEs system. In both panel, curves represent the temporal evolution of the states of the system. The legend for each states represent the final ratio of agents at the end of the simulation. Maximum infected in ABM, 577 persons in $t=129$ [days], maximum infected in ODE, 542 persons, in $t=135$ [days]. It is worth noting that these systems do not include the information model."</p>

              <p>Additional Editor Comments (optional):</p>
              <p>It seems that there is a typo in Eq(1) at the end of Page 9: on the right side, the value of q_i(t+1) should not be 0, instead of 1?</p>
