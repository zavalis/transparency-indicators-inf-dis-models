                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">As malaria cases have declined throughout Nepal, imported cases comprise an increasing share of the remaining malaria caseload, yet how to effectively target mobile and migrant populations (MMPs) at greatest risk is not well understood. This formative research aimed to confirm the link between imported and indigenous cases, characterize high-risk MMPs, and identify opportunities to adapt surveillance and intervention strategies to them.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The study used a mixed-methods approach in three districts in far and mid-western Nepal, including (i) a retrospective analysis of passive surveillance data, (ii) a quantitative health facility-based survey of imported cases and their MMP social contacts recruited by peer-referral, and (iii) focus group (FG) discussions and key informant interviews (KIIs) with a subset of survey participants. Retrospective case data were summarised and the association between monthly indigenous case counts and importation rates in the previous month was investigated using Bayesian spatio-temporal regression models. Quantitative data from structured interviews were summarised to develop profiles of imported cases and MMP contacts, including travel characteristics and malaria knowledge, attitudes and practice. Descriptive statistics of the size of casesâ MMP social networks are presented as a measure of potential programme reach. To explore opportunities and barriers for targeted malaria surveillance, data from FGs and KIIs were formally analysed using a thematic content analysis approach.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">More than half (54.1%) of malaria cases between 2013 and 2016 were classified as imported and there was a positive association between monthly indigenous cases (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.02 95% CI 1.01â1.03) and the previous monthâs case importation rate. High-risk MMPs were identified as predominantly adult male labourers, who travel to malaria endemic areas of India, often lack a basic understanding of malaria transmission and prevention, rarely use ITNs while travelling and tend not to seek treatment when ill or prefer informal private providers. Important obstacles were identified to accessing Nepali MMPs at border crossings and at workplaces within India. However, strong social connectivity during travel and while in India, as well as return to Nepal for large seasonal festivals, provide opportunities for peer-referral-based and venue-based surveillance and intervention approaches, respectively.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Population mobility and imported malaria cases from India may help to drive local transmission in border areas of far and mid-western Nepal. Enhanced surveillance targeting high-risk MMP subgroups would improve early malaria diagnosis and treatment, as well as provide a platform for education and intervention campaigns. A combination of community-based approaches is likely necessary to achieve malaria elimination in Nepal.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">As a result of sustained control measures, the malaria burden in Nepal has declined steadily since 1985 and malaria transmission has reached a very low level, with an annual parasite incidence (API) of 0.04 cases per 1000 population in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although Nepal is moving towards implementing elimination strategies, high rates of importation along its southern border present a major challenge to continued progress. As the number of total cases declined by 92% between 2002 (12,750 cases) and 2016 (1009 cases), the proportion of cases classified as imported increased from approximately 20 to 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The majority of imported cases during this period reported a history of travel to malaria-endemic areas of India. Close to two million Nepalese are estimated to work in India as seasonal or long-term labourers, and a large proportion of external labour migration, particularly seasonal migration, is believed to originate in malaria endemic areas such as far- and mid-western Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This population movement across Nepalâs southern border, which citizens of both nations may cross freely, is thought to contribute to persistence of local malaria foci in border areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The fact that imported cases have not declined at the same rate as indigenous cases suggests that additional control measures may be needed to effectively prevent, detect and resolve infections among mobile and migrant populations (MMPs).</p>
              <p id="Par6">Free malaria testing and treatment are available to Nepali and Indian nationals through 162 government primary health care (PHC) centres, health posts (HPs) and sub-health posts (SHPs) in 22 border districts of Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The standard of care includes radical cure for <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> consisting of a 14-day course of primaquine in combination with chloroquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. During the eradication era (1960â1970), the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) of Nepal operated cross-border screening in posts in Kakarvitta of Jhapa District in east and Gaddha Chowki in Kanchanpur District in far-western region; these posts aided in the early identification and tracking of imported cases. Given sustained malaria importation, the NMCP is once again considering year-round border screening as a surveillance approach for MMPs, yet plans have been delayed due to infrastructure challenges and questions around cost-effectiveness. More generally, the priority that the NMCP should place on reducing importation is unclear due to the lack of evidence of the extent to which imported infections may actually sustain indigenous transmission.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Epidemiological and mathematical modelling studies in numerous eliminating countries bordering higher burden neighbours demonstrate that transmission largely persists due to the continued pressure of imported cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Churcher et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] provide statistical evidence that controlled non-endemic malaria (where the average number of new persons infected by a person with malaria is less than one) has been reached once the proportion of imported cases among detected cases reaches between 32 and 48%, depending on case burden.</p>
              <p id="Par8">Given the low malaria burden in Nepal and high cross-border movement in remaining endemic areas, there is a need to improve understanding of the subgroups of MMPs at greatest risk of importing malaria, their role in sustaining local transmission, and how to access them. There is currently limited information regarding basic characteristics of MMPs that may be necessary to design effective screening and prevention interventions, including operational questions of how they should be timed and targeted, such as the travel patterns of MMPs and the specific conditions that may lead to exposure during travel and while living and working abroad. Potential operational challenges that may limit access of MMPs to routine malaria prevention and treatment and pose a constraint to improving diagnosis and treatment have not been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">Relatedly, it is essential to understand whether current surveillance approaches effectively detect cases and accurately assess levels of malaria prevalence among MMPs at the population level. Due to frequent travel, MMPs may be under-represented in routine case data and absent during household visits. Facility-based surveillance approaches may also fail to capture MMPs who face barriers to accessing public health facilities, prefer private facilities, or who do not seek care at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. While several complementary, targeted surveillance strategies are increasingly under investigation for reaching subgroups at elevated risk for malaria, such as border screening, respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and time-location sampling (TLS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], it is unclear whether these approaches would be appropriate for high-risk MMPs in Nepal.</p>
              <p id="Par10">This formative research study aimed to address these knowledge gaps in far and mid-western Nepal, specifically to (1) quantify the association between imported and local transmission, (2) document the social determinants of imported malaria, (3) characterize high-risk MMPs, and (4) identify potential surveillance and intervention strategies in MMPs and how they may be optimized through spatial and temporal targeting.</p>

                <p id="Par12">The study was conducted in three historically high-burden border districts in far and mid-western Nepal with high population movement to India: Kanchanpur, Kailali and Bardiya (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These districts form part of the lowland <italic>terai</italic> in western Nepal, where malaria transmission is concentrated, and key foci bordering the malaria-endemic, Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> predominates malaria transmission, which is highly seasonal with the majority of transmission occurring from June to September during the monsoon season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The primary malaria vectors are <italic>Anopheles fluviatilis</italic> and <italic>Anopheles maculatus</italic> (responsible for transmission in the forest fringe, foothills and inner terai) and <italic>Anopheles annularis</italic>, an inefficient vector found in the outer <italic>terai</italic>. Historically, <italic>Anopheles minimus</italic> was also an important and highly efficient vector in forest and forest-fringe areas, but was reported to be eliminated following DDT spraying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.Â 1</label><caption><p>Study site districts (Kanchanpur, Kailali and Bardiya) and formal border crossings (black squares) in far-western and mid-western Nepal (inset).

</p>
                <p id="Par13">Together, the three study districts have a combined population of 1.9 million and accounted for 34% of the total burden of malaria in Nepal in 2016, with the annual parasite incidence (API) ranging from 0.27 cases per 1000 population in Kailali to 0.14 and 0.07 in Kanchanpur and Bardiya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There is a large private health sector in these districts, but private clinics and pharmacies remain largely unregulated and have low case reporting rates. Based on data from the 2014 Malaria Indicator Cluster Survey, febrile children under the age of 5Â years in the far western <italic>terai</italic> were more likely to seek treatment with a private provider (49.0%) than at a public health facility (26.4%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. An estimated 0.7 million migrants cross annually at four formal border check points on the border with India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Planned implementation of a border malaria check post at the main crossing in Kanchanpur district (Gaddha Chowki) has been delayed since 2013 due to resource limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par14">Following WHO and Nepal national guidelines, all study components defined a malaria case as a person in which the presence of malaria parasites has been confirmed by microscopy or rapid diagnostic test (RDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. All <italic>P. vivax</italic> cases were assumed to be incident, based on a lack of identifying information to distinguish potentially relapsing infections. Imported cases were defined according to national guidelines as malaria cases confirmed who moved from their permanent or previous residence within the past 4Â weeks to stay or work in a different district or country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This working definition was revised during the pilot stage of prospective data collection due to low case numbers and the predominance of <italic>P. vivax</italic>.

Monthly imported and indigenous case numbers were aggregated by village development committee/municipality (VDC/MC) and used to calculate monthly incidence rates using population denominators provided by the NMCP. These data are estimated from the 2011 National Population and Housing Census in Nepal and assume a 1.35 annual growth rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

                  <p id="Par22">The association between monthly indigenous case counts (outcome) and importation rates in the previous month was investigated using Poisson regression models in âR-INLAâ, which is a widely used software library for approximating Bayesian inference.

Environmental covariates with a <italic>P</italic> value ofâ&lt;â0.05 were included in the initial multivariate model with logged importation rate, district and year as fixed effects and evaluated using a process of backwards-stepwise elimination. Covariates were retained where the deviance information criteria (DIC) was lower or changed the primary association of interest more than 10%.

Both imported and indigenous malaria transmission in this area of Nepal continues to be dominated by <italic>P. vivax</italic>, although there has been an overall decline in cases during this period (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In 2014, the number of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cases classified as indigenous dropped by 91% (from 88 to 8), which corresponded with a spike in use of RDTs.

                  <p id="Par45">Imported cases had distinct bimodal seasonality, with the first peak occurring in April-June and a second peak in AugustâSeptember (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S2). These periods roughly correspond to when travellers commonly return back to Nepal for a month for agricultural activities (harvesting wheat and paddy cultivation) during AprilâJune and return for festivals and harvesting of rice, other grains, and paddies in SeptemberâOctober. In contrast to imported malaria, indigenous malaria transmission in Nepal showed a single, extended peak and greater variation between years (see in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S2).</p>

Foci tended to occur in areas of low to mid population density and the decrease in incidence over time corresponded with smaller geographic foci of indigenous transmission. Species-specific maps of indigenous annual parasite incidence (API) for these years showed similar trends, but highlighted the precipitous decline and highly focal distribution of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in comparison to <italic>P. vivax</italic> in these areas (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.Â 3</label><caption><p>All species imported and indigenous annual parasite index (API) at the village development committee (VDC) level in the three study districts between 2013 and 2016.

The two most common destinations were Surat (Gujarat, India) and Mumbai (Maharashtra, India), which made up nearly half (45.0%) of the most recent trips. Due to the respective distance and reason for travel, median transportation time averaged 3Â days (IQR 1.5) and trips were of long duration (median of 5Â months; IQR 9Â months). While only a fifth of trips were reported as seasonal travel, many participants returned home to Nepal in September or October to celebrate festival season, which also coincides with the harvests, as described by the following quote, among others:<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>TableÂ 5</label><caption><p>Travel characteristics of 140 MMPs, including both imported cases and MMP social

                  <p id="Par54">Characteristics that may suggest how to access MMPs for targeted surveillance include membership in specific occupational groups and common transit points along heavily trafficked travel routes. Common occupations included security guards (15.1%), factory work (19.3%), and hotel service (14.3%), but some forms of employment were specific to destination. For instance, Gujarat hosts more factory work (36%) while Maharashtra is common for security guard work (40%) or hotel jobs (24%).

                  <p id="Par55">After adjusting for age and gender, MMP participants who worked outside had a sixfold increase in the odds of being an imported case compared with those who worked solely indoors (OR: 6.07, 95% CI 1.15â32.22). Working as a security guard, in particular, was perceived as a high-risk occupation by MMPs in FGs. While no specific destinations were associated with being a case rather than a contact in the survey data, longer transit times (in days) and shorter duration of travel (in months) were weakly associated with greater risk (OR: 13.9 95% CI 1.08â179.0 and OR: 0.74 95% CI 0.54â1.02) after adjusting for age, gender and working outdoors. FGs corroborated the potential risk of infection during travel, citing mosquitoes biting at transit points and within buses, as well as a higher perception of malaria risk at destinations further from Nepal (such as Gujarat or Mumbai).</p>

In general, imported cases had better knowledge of malaria symptoms and availability of free testing compared to their MMP social contacts, which is likely due to their recent illness and subsequent diagnosis at a health facility (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).

                  <title>Health-seeking behaviours</title>
                  <p id="Par57">There was a low awareness of free, government-provided malaria services at public facilities amongst MMPs (32.9%) (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Reported treatment-seeking behaviours at these locations were even lower: of the 20% (Nâ=â16) of MMP social contacts reporting a fever in the prior 6Â months, the vast majority (Nâ=â15) sought treatment from the private health sector only (pharmacy or private clinic/hospital). Only one participant went to a public hospital for diagnosis. Qualitative findings from FGs and KIIs corroborated these findings and suggested that individuals would preferentially attend private facilities for fever and delay coming to the public health facilities until the fever is non-resolving or more severe. For example, one case stated:<disp-quote><p id="Par58"><italic>âThe private clinic staff suggested that I go to the public health facility, since the government provides free services there. It was only after I had malaria several times that I went straight to the government health facility, because I knew.â</italic> (Male, Kailali, FG)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
                  <p id="Par59">Perceived barriers to treatment according to KIIs were lack of medicines at health posts and increased travel time. A number of key informants suggested that people may also seek treatment from traditional healers or travel to India for medical services, particularly at major transit points like Paliya.</p>

                  <title>Knowledge and use of malaria prevention methods</title>
                  <p id="Par60">Knowledge of malaria prevention was low in MMP participants, with less than a third (21â28%) able to name ITNs as a method to protect against malaria infection (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Most travellers (80%) did not use any form of malaria prevention on their most recent trip, and ITN and repellant use were both low (20.0% and 11.4%) (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Despite this, many FG participants reported that they regularly used a net while at home in Nepal if available. While reported use of a net was common, KII and FG participants cited irregular distributions of nets, lack of knowledge around how and where to obtain nets, and low-income financial status as key barriers to ITN access in Nepal. Personal preference to not use the net due to the heat and perceived sensitivity to the chemicals in the net was also reported as a barrier to ITN use.</p>
                  <p id="Par61">While travelling, lack of ITN use was generally attributed to lack of availability, affordability, and type of living quarters. Even if workers were in possession of a mosquito net while travelling, some participants would not be able to assemble it in their living quarters in India. A few participants commented on landlord restrictions around hanging nets in rented accommodation as a barrier to use:<disp-quote><p id="Par62"><italic>âWe stay in rented house in India. House owner do not allow us to use nails striking on the wall, so it is impossible for us to use mosquito net. That is why we do not use mosquito net in India.â</italic> (Male, Kailali, FG).</p></disp-quote>

                  <p id="Par63">Some participants did mention burning wood or mosquito coils in India, however, and one participant reported that his living quarters in Surat were sprayed for mosquitoes.</p>

First, high levels of social connectivity amongst MMPs provide an entry point for surveillance and interventions. Most participants preferred to travel to India within a group, in part due to safety. Corroborating data from TableÂ <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>, which shows that MMPs tended to travel in small or moderate sized groups of 2â15 people (70.3%), participants stated:<disp-quote><p id="Par65"><italic>âSome people have two to three people in a group while some have six to seven people in a group while travelling.â</italic> (Male, Kanchanpur, FG)</p></disp-quote>

                  <p id="Par67">In India, Nepalese MMPs tend to stay well connected and frequently live together in large communities of varying size (upwards of 400â500 people), with sometimes as many as 20 people from a single village. Imported cases reported a median of 8 MMP social contacts known at the travel destination and engaged in the same activity during the past 60Â days with some individuals (nâ=â7) indicating high numbers of contacts (50 or more) (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>). Another potential entry point for venue-based surveillance are Nepalese societies, which organize large cultural gatherings in many common destinations in India, typically on Sundays with several hundred people attending. Finally, there are highly networked MMP individuals (for example, involved in transportation or local leaders) who could be recruited to support peer-driven interventions.<table-wrap id="Tab7"><label>TableÂ 7</label><caption><p>Size and recruitment of peer travel networks of 58 imported cases over 63 trips to India</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left">Mean (median) [range]</th><th align="left">SD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Total number of peers in caseâs âsame destination, same activityâ travel network andâ¦<sup>a</sup></td><td char="[" align="char">16 (21) [0 100]</td><td char="." align="char">21</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Â â¦Anticipated to be present in study district in next 2Â weeks, andâ¦</td><td char="[" align="char">3 (0) [0 20]</td><td char="." align="char">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Â â¦Aged over 18Â years</td><td char="[" align="char">2 (0) [0 20]</td><td char="." align="char">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Number for whom contact details were provided<sup>b</sup></td><td char="[" align="char">1 (0) [0 5]</td><td char="." align="char">2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Two cases excluded with outliers (850) where travel was to Africa</p><p><sup>a</sup>Number of people who live or work in the study district in Nepal, who had travelled to the same destination in India and engaged in the same activity in the past 60Â days</p><p><sup>b</sup>Meeting the above criteria, maximum of 5</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>

                  <p id="Par70">Barriers to malaria screening identified during FGs included unawareness of health services, particularly availability of free testing and treatment for malaria, in addition to low literacy, fear of medical visits, and the perception that screening is necessary only if one is ill. One FG referenced a recent polio immunization campaign implemented at the border, in which some people refused to participate based on the belief that they might be drugged or would feel faint.</p>

                  <p id="Par71">Strong social ties between Nepalese travellers offer an opportunity to conduct malaria screening through social networks.

                  <p id="Par74">In the context of this study, however, peer-referral resulted in enrollment of a fraction of the total MMP social contacts reported known by MMP cases involved in the same activity, in large part because few contacts were expected to return from India in the allotted two-week follow-up period (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref> and Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Lack of contact details was another limitation.

                  <p id="Par75">MMPs expressed mixed views of border screening and highlighted potential operational challenges. First, participants did not perceive any particular MMP subgroup to be at higher risk of fever upon return from India. All participants believed fevers are relatively rare and may appear before, during or after travel. Second, while survey findings indicated most MMPs travel through formal border crossings (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>), some FG participants mentioned some people (particularly those involved in illegal activities) may use informal border crossings. Some FG participants believe screening posts would be most successful if located at border stations or nearby roads or markets. Although some favoured mandatory, government-run screening to maximize participation, others cited barriers that included lack of time, concerns about safety at border check posts, and distrust of police:<disp-quote><p id="Par76"><italic>âWhen we travel from India then many police threaten us by asking money, asking our passport and citizenship, so people fear to participate in such gatherings.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par81">This study sought to address key knowledge gaps around malaria importation in far and mid-western Nepal, including investigating the association between imported and local transmission, better characterizing MMPs and identifying potential opportunities to optimize targeted surveillance and intervention strategies for this population. The analysis of retrospective case data demonstrated an association between (lagged) imported case rate and local rate in this area of Nepal, such that each percent increase in importation the month prior led to a two percent increase in local incidence rate. Recently imported cases and their MMP social contacts were found to be predominantly adult male labourers who travel to malaria endemic areas of India and were characterized by similar risk factors: they lacked a basic understanding of malaria transmission and prevention, rarely used ITNs while travelling, and when ill, tended not to seek treatment or prefer informal private providers. These findings suggest that many cases among these individuals may go undetected and that more targeted strategies are needed to improve coverage of education, testing, and surveillance in this population. To access high-risk MMPs more effectively, the study identified community-based surveillance approaches as the most promising options: strong social connectivity within these groups, concentration of Nepali MMPs in specific communities and workplaces within India; and well-attended seasonal festivals that motivate return to Nepal provide opportunities for peer-referral- and venue-based surveillance and interventions.</p>
              <p id="Par82">The finding that high-risk MMPs tend to be adult male labourers with a history of travel to India has been reported by previous studies in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and is consistent with a profile of imported cases as adult males in other elimination contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The infrequent self-reported net use (20%) during travel contrasted with the high reported programmatic coverage (&gt;â90%) of LLINs in Nepal since 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Even when home in Nepal, many of the MMPs interviewed were unsure how to obtain nets. MMPs may be less likely to receive nets during regular distributions in Nepal due to living in remote areas and absence from home during distributions. Innovative approaches are needed to make nets available to MMPs upon return from India, both for their own protection and to prevent onward transmission.</p>
              <p id="Par83">Given the high proportion of imported cases in this setting and receptivity of the <italic>terai</italic> region, some ongoing transmission is expected and will be mediated by the malaria species present and vectorial capacity. Past studies have shown that environmental variables are important drivers of vector density and seasonal patterns of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], however the relationships, metrics and temporal lag periods used vary across settings and vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This study demonstrates that receptivity in this area of Nepal is determined by higher levels of rainfall and temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Low use of public sector health services by MMPs is a key limitation of routine surveillance data and there is a need to incorporate private sector surveillance alongside campaigns to improve public sector use by these populations. In addition, improving the quality of routinely collected travel histories in case-based surveillance will allow automated analyses and mapping of sources and sinks on an ongoing basis to improve geographical targeting of interventions.</p>
              <p id="Par84">Accessing and achieving high coverage of vector control and surveillance interventions in MMPs is a key challenge to reducing malaria importation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. All three strategies examined (border screening, peer-referral, and targeting well-attended venues) were found to be feasible, however would need to be adapted to address the unique operational challenges identified. The finding of strong social connectivity among Nepalese travellers, while in transit and at destinations in India, suggests that peer-supported methods are promising to identify and contact MMPs to disseminate interventions. Improved knowledge of malaria risk avoidance, screening programmes, treatment options, ITNs, and repellants are shown to benefit travellers directly and improve access to and use of existing malaria health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par85">Decades of research portray migration as a socially embedded process and support a role for utilizing existing social support and network structure to optimize behaviour change interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The findings from this study suggest that within Nepal, an obstacle to peer-driven methods is the delay until MMPs return home. This may be addressed by sending periodic follow-up reminders to refer MMP social contacts once they arrive, potentially by SMS as most MMPs were contactable by mobile phones. Peer promotors or navigators (MMP group members who are employed by a malaria programme to provide information or ânavigateâ health services) could also be employed to reach other MMPs while in transit and at destinations in India with high concentrations of Nepalese from far-western Nepal. Community leaders and established Nepalese societies were also identified that should be enlisted to promote uptake of peer-driven programmes or to directly provide screening or behaviour change communication (BCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] to society members.</p>
              <p id="Par86">Beyond peer-driven approaches, we identified well-attended venues and work sites in India that could provide convenient physical locations to access large numbers of Nepali MMPs through a venue-based approach. Specific occupational groups working outdoors in malaria endemic destinations, such as security guards in Mumbai, could also be targeted upon return from India for voluntary screening. Border screening is resource and labour intensive, making it infeasible in many settings, but targeted approaches are likely to improve the test positivity rate and overall cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Study participantsâ concerns about confidentiality of testing results and distrust of police, suggest that, just as in more stigmatized conditions such as HIV and STIs, malaria screening should be conducted in designated confidential areas within or nearby the venues and/or border check points and with careful selection of staff. Considering the high volume of border crossings during peak times, there is a clear need to use imported case data to construct high-risk profiles (potentially using a more representative MMP control group) to identify age, gender, travel and possibly occupational profiles to target screening to potentially asymptomatic individuals.</p>
              <p id="Par87">This study also found that longer transit times and shorter duration of stay abroad were weakly associated with a greater risk of malaria. Shorter-term migrants may perceive less risk, resulting in poorer malaria preventive behaviours, or have increased occupational exposures compared to longer-term migrants. Alternatively, imported cases may return to Nepal to seek treatment when they fall ill, which could result in a spurious association with shorter duration of travel. The qualitative portion of the study did not substantiate illness as a reason to return to Nepal.</p>
              <p id="Par88">Several methodological limitations should be considered. Radical cure of <italic>P. vivax</italic> is the standard of care in Nepal, but there is frequently low adherence to these guidelines from both the provider and patient populations. This is believed to be due to concerns around G6PD status and low compliance to the full 14-day course of medication. This study did not investigate these issues in MMPs, but it remains an important barrier to achieving elimination in Nepal. It was not possible to distinguish incident and potentially relapsing <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections in these analyses. Consequently, local and imported case numbers are likely to be overestimated and may obscure recent geographical trends. Case ascertainment was limited by lack of private sector involvement and, in the case of retrospective data, other reporting gaps. The prospective recruitment period was planned to coincide with the festival season but was a month delayed and subsequently short (3Â months) in duration, which limited case and MMP recruitment and may affect generalizability. While a large proportion of imported cases (35%) and MMP contacts (33%) were interviewed on the same day as diagnosis or referral, the remainder were followed up within a week (75% and 39%) or longer. MMP contacts with follow up longer than 4Â weeks (12.5%) were due to longer than expected return from travels. The data did not allow calculation of the total number of MMPs within the extended network or the maximum number of potential referrals, as there was no way of accounting for double-counting given the high degree of social connectivity and capped referrals at 5. However, it is likely that one round of peer-referral with a 2Â weeks follow up will not be sufficient to recruit a large part of this network. Peer-referral recruitment was further limited by delays in enrollment, indicating that MMPs were not necessarily travelling back to Nepal in groups. In addition, MMP social contacts were sometimes lost to follow up due to incomplete contact information or residing in a remote area of the district, suggesting additional operational challenges for the peer-referral approach. Remote residence and scheduling conflicts were substantial challenges to organizing FGs, which may have influenced findings by restricting our sample to those with better access. The effect of this potential bias was minimized by reimbursing travel costs and working flexible hours to accommodate participants schedules and travel needs. Due to the clustered nature of the data (i.e. MMP social contacts were matched to the imported cases by destination) many potential risk factors are likely to be underestimated in the conditional logistic regression analysis. A more representative MMP control group, recruited through alternative means, would be useful in identifying additional risk factors to guide targeted screening approaches. Findings from the retrospective analysis should be interpreted with caution as it used area level data and observed correlation between imported and local cases could be introduced by regional seasonality or misclassification bias.</p>
              <p id="Par89">A cross-border strategy with India remains key to achieving and maintaining long-term elimination targets in Nepal. This study highlights the routes through which parasites move between Nepal and India and the surveillance gaps that make timely diagnosis and treatment in MMPs so challenging. Key informants also mentioned Indian migrants living in Nepal who may be vulnerable or contributing to local transmission and who are not represented in this study. Ensuring that MMPs from both sides of the border have adequate access to malaria prevention, testing and treatment along key routes and destinations will be critical to achieving regional elimination. A regional initiative in 2010 opened the door towards implementing cross-border activities for the control of three vector-borne diseases, including malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Cross-border mechanisms to improve surveillance, information sharing and bilateral support are essential to reduce malaria transmission in MMPs and in highly trafficked destinations on both sides of the border, thereby benefiting both Nepalese and Indian populations.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par90">Population mobility and malaria importation from India are key challenges to malaria elimination in border areas of far and mid-western Nepal. This study has helped to better understand characteristics of MMPs and identify specific ways in which malaria surveillance and response can be adapted to optimize coverage and case detection in high-risk travellers. Specifically, intervention campaigns can tailor their timing, messaging and geographic focus to better target this population, and surveillance and response approaches can leverage strong social connectivity to improve intervention uptake. A combination of community and peer-referral based approaches will likely be needed to achieve malaria elimination in border areas.</p>
