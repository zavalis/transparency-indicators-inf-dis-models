              <abstract>
                <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease of humans caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the first case was identified in China in December 2019 the disease has spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. In this article, we present an agent-based model of COVID-19 in Luxembourg, and use it to estimate the impact, on cases and deaths, of interventions including testing, contact tracing, lockdown, curfew and vaccination. Our model is based on collation, with agents performing activities and moving between locations accordingly. The model is highly heterogeneous, featuring spatial clustering, over 2000 behavioural types and a 10 minute time resolution. The model is validated against COVID-19 clinical monitoring data collected in Luxembourg in 2020. Our model predicts far fewer cases and deaths than the equivalent equation-based SEIR model. In particular, with <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub>0</sub> = 2.45, the SEIR model infects 87% of the resident population while our agent-based model infects only around 23% of the resident population. Our simulations suggest that testing and contract tracing reduce cases substantially, but are less effective at reducing deaths. Lockdowns are very effective although costly, while the impact of an 11pm-6am curfew is relatively small. When vaccinating against a future outbreak, our results suggest that herd immunity can be achieved at relatively low coverage, with substantial levels of protection achieved with only 30% of the population fully immune. When vaccinating in the midst of an outbreak, the challenge is more difficult. In this context, we investigate the impact of vaccine efficacy, capacity, hesitancy and strategy. We conclude that, short of a permanent lockdown, vaccination is by far the most effective way to suppress and ultimately control the spread of COVID-19.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is among the most disruptive global events in modern history. At the time of writing, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread to almost every country in the world, resulting in over two hundred million infections and at least five million deaths. It is of vital importance that we continue to build a rigorous understanding of how the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads and predict the impact of interventions, to help policy makers formulate effective strategies that save lives while simultaneously balancing the economic and social impact.</p>
              <p>Central to such a strategy is a recognition of heterogeneity and behavioural diversity. Indeed, the regional impact of COVID-19 has been extremely variable. For a given region, the impact of any infectious disease of humans depends fundamentally on who lives in that region, how these individuals interact with one another and how this population connects with the populations of other regions. For a given individual, factors such as age, sex, ethnicity and the presence of underlying medical conditions might determine how that individual responds to an infection. Transmission is not only determined by the nature of the disease itself, but also by a multitude of factors relating to human behaviour. Such factors might include the time of day, the day of the week, the climate, seasonal effects and the prevailing culture of the region. These underlying variables result in correlations, producing an extremely complex and computationally irreducible system of social interactions and disease dynamics, beyond the scope of simple mathematical theory. Modelling the impact of public health policy, in the context of an infectious disease such as COVID-19, is therefore necessarily difficult and subject to unavoidable limitations.</p>
              <p>One commonly used indicator of epidemic dynamics is the effective reproductive number <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub>, defined roughly as the expected number of secondary infections caused by a typical infected individual at time <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>. This number aggregates the factors mentioned above by simultaneously averaging over individuals and individual behaviour. However, the usefulness of this quantity is subject to certain limitations [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and, since it is defined in terms of a universal average, it is not possible to measure the true <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> of a population. Additional simplifying assumptions, on the population and its mixing habits, are required in order that <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> be estimated. The most basic assumption supposes that all individuals are identical and mix with one another with equal probability. In a sufficiently large population with sufficiently many individuals infected, such mass action might be realistic, but in circumstances where the proportion of infected individuals is low, it neglects the unpredictable nature of interactions between small numbers of people. Nevertheless, such homogeneity assumptions give rise to a number of popular mathematical and computational models, including the equation-based compartmental models [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Such models typically use ordinary differential equations to keep track of how many individuals are in various health states at various times, sometimes stratified by age or households. The <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> associated to such a model can be fairly easily calculated, as well as certain other quantities of interest, for example limiting equilibria.</p>
              <p>The equation-based approach to epidemic modelling could be considered the <italic toggle="yes">top-down</italic> approach, which postulates a set of equations whose solution, after appropriate configuration, is supposed to describe the system in question. Such an approach has the advantages of flexibility and speed, typically involving only a small number of parameters, but on the other hand is unable to capture the heterogeneity and granularity obtained using the <italic toggle="yes">bottom-up</italic> approach of an agent-based model. In an agent-based model, the simultaneous actions and interactions of multiple individuals, referred to as agents, are simulated in an attempt to re-create and predict the emergence of complex phenomena as a result of their collective behaviour.</p>
              <p>Agent-based models are computationally intensive, and therefore have risen to prominence only in recent decades, with one of the earliest examples being John Conway’s Game of Life [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Agent-based models have been applied across many areas of study, for example ecology [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], social science [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], macroeconomics and financial markets [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and epidemiology. Agent-based models have been used extensively to study the spread of infectious diseases including COVID-19, as will be discussed in the next section.</p>
              <p>In this article, we present an agent-based epidemiological model based on collocation. At each moment in time, our model partitions the population into subsets, with each subset corresponding to a particular location, for example a house, restaurant or shop. These subsets describe who is in each location at each time, with homogeneous mixing occurring internally. As individuals move between locations, the subsets are updated accordingly. On top of this sits our disease model and a range of interventions. The model is custom-built, featuring numerous heterogeneous dimensions and behavioural diversity. It is able to capture both spatial and temporal variations in disease dynamics. The model consists of four basic layers, described as follows:</p>

              </list>
              <p>Interventions are the means by which a policy maker can control or suppress an epidemic. Interventions are either pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical. The World Health Organization divides the latter into four categories [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. First there are the personal protective measures, which includes improved hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette and face masks. Second are the environmental interventions of improved ventilation and surface and object cleaning. Third are the various physical distancing measures, including such things as quarantining, school closures, workplace measures, closure of businesses, cancelling of events, curfews and lockdowns. Fourth are the travel-related measures, referring to travel advisories, entry and exit screening, internal travel restrictions and border closures. Various combinations of these interventions have been implemented by governments around the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with testing and contact tracing systems being used to gather information on who is, or who might be, infected. Accompanying the non-pharmaceutical inventions are the pharmaceutical inventions, in particular anti-viral therapies and, perhaps most importantly, vaccination.</p>
              <p>Vaccination is generally considered the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases, with mass vaccination campaigns having achieved the global eradication of smallpox and the suppression of diseases such as polio, measles and tetanus from much of the world, thereby saving hundreds of millions of lives. Controlling COVID-19 on a global scale cannot be achieved using only the non-pharmaceutical interventions listed above, associated to which are enormous economic and social costs, and therefore mass vaccination against COVID-19 must form a central part of any successful COVID-19 control strategy. There are well known mathematical models of the relationship between vaccination and herd immunity, for example [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>Several COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and tested (see, for example, [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) and are being distributed around the world. In most countries, vaccines are administered according to a priority list, starting with either those individuals who most require immediate protection against the disease, or those individuals for whom reduced transmission will be of the greatest benefit from a public health perspective. Besides the manufacturing and logistical challenges associated with mass vaccination, there is also the issue of vaccine hesitancy [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which refers to the fact that significant numbers of people would prefer, for various reasons, not to get vaccinated. Assessing the impact of vaccination, against the backdrop of various overlapping non-pharmaceutical interventions, is therefore challenging.</p>
              <p>The objective of this article is to compare interventions according to their epidemiological impact in the model. We consider, in particular, the following questions:</p>
              <list list-type="bullet">
                <list-item>
                  <p>How do non-pharmaceutical interventions compare, in terms of their impact on cases and deaths?</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>At what level is herd immunity achieved?</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>To what extent does the success of a vaccination campaign depend on factors such as efficacy, daily capacity and hesitancy?</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>How does a vaccination strategy that focusses on reducing deaths compare to one that focusses on reducing transmission?</p>
                </list-item>
              </list>
              <p>In this article, we are not concerned with the economic or social costs of the interventions. Moreover we do not look for optimal strategies, this being instead a topic for future research. Validation will focus on cases, hospitalizations and deaths, avoiding such things as the basic or effective reproduction numbers. We will measure the impact of interventions by comparing cases and deaths with those of the baseline scenario in which no interventions are active. We will suppose vaccination is implemented in a two-dose format, with an interval of time between doses and limited daily availability. Our interpretation of efficacy is that, with a certain probability, a dose delivers immunity that protects the individual against infection. We suppose there exists a priority scheme that administers doses to certain individuals before others, based on their age, living arrangements or place of work, and who potentially refuse the vaccine with a certain age-dependent probability.</p>
              <p>Our model is configured to represent Luxembourg, a small western European country with a population on 1st January 2020 estimated at 626,108, together with populations of cross-border workers in the neighbouring countries of Belgium, France and Germany. Input data therefore comes from various institutions and surveys associated with Luxembourg. Consequently, this article investigates the impact of interventions specifically in Luxembourg, although the model itself is flexible and can be adapted to other regions. Luxembourg, however, is particularly interesting because, while being an independent nation with its own unique response to the COVID-19 pandemic, has a population small enough to be within the reach of a computational agent-based model.</p>

              <p>Census data, including data on age distribution and household structure, were obtained from STATEC, the government statistics service of Luxembourg [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Public transport data came from Mobilitéit [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and the Ministry of Mobility and Public Transport (MMTP) of the government of Luxembourg [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Population grid data came from the 2011 GEOSTAT study, organized by Eurostat [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Location counts came from STATEC and OpenStreetMap [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Behavioural and mobility data came from the 2014 Luxembourg Time Use Survey [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and the 2017 Luxmobil Survey [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], conducted by STATEC and MMTP, respectively. COVID-19 clinical monitoring data came from IGSS, the General Inspectorate of Social Security of Luxembourg [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Interventions were otherwise parametrized using public knowledge, for example on the timing of lockdowns.</p>
              <p>The key unknown parameters in our model are the transmission probability, initial exposure count and asymptomatic probability. The calibration of these and other parameters is discussed in the model evaluation section.</p>
              <p>The organization of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we briefly describe the state of the art, referencing a sample of articles from the immense body of work that has emerged since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the section after we describe our model. This is followed by a section on model evaluation, in which we discuss the processes of verification and validation and the limitations of the model. After that we present and discuss our main results. Finally, in the last section, we draw conclusions, while making further remarks about the limitations of the study and directions for future research.</p>

              <title>State of the art</title>
              <p>Since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, many thousands of articles have been written about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its spread throughout the world. While some have used models based on systems of differential equations to describe the spread of the virus, others have taken the approach of agent-based modelling, with some studies incorporating elements of both. Early models focussed on predicting the severity of the pandemic, the impact of social distancing restrictions and face masks and the consequences of lifting restrictions too early. As the first wave of cases passed, the focus then shifted towards the lifting of restrictions and the reopening of schools and universities. Later in 2020, the emergence of second waves and the onset of mass vaccination against COVID-19 led many to investigate the impact of vaccination specifically, in the context of rising cases and against the backdrop of other non-pharmaceutical interventions.</p>
              <p>Among the great range of publications and preprints focussing on the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions, consider [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] for examples of models based on systems of differential equations, and [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] for examples of agent-based models. A number of the agent-based models are open-source, including Covasim [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], OpenABM-Covid19 [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], COMOKIT [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and JUNE [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Covasim and OpenABM-Covid19 assume individuals mix homogeneously outside households, workplaces or schools. On the other hand, COMOKIT and JUNE are somewhat more similar to our own model, using dynamic contact structures developed via mobility and daily agendas.</p>
              <p>In addition to our own agent-based model of COVID-19 in Luxembourg, Laurent Mombaerts and Atte Aalto have also developed such a model, using social security data to construct a contact network. Their model has been used in the recently published article [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] to study the large-scale COVID-19 testing programme in Luxembourg. Epidemic models based on contact networks are popular since various mathematical tools from graph theory can be applied to such models, resulting in a topological or geometric analysis of the underlying network [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. For other articles examining Luxembourg specifically, consider [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], in which the authors used an equation-based model to search for optimal strategies for lifting restrictions in Luxembourg and several other countries, using genetic algorithms and techniques from machine learning, or [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], in which the authors studied the interplay between the epidemiological and economic aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Luxembourg. In [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], the authors used a compartmental model to study the impact of interventions in Luxembourg, including vaccination.</p>
              <p>With several vaccines having being developed against COVID-19, a large number of articles have been written investigating their potential impact. Consider, for example [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261330.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], the impact of vaccination on cases, hospitalisations and deaths was studied using agent-based models, these two articles focussing on areas in the United States and Canada, respectively. The authors of both articles assumed a predetermined coverage rate achieved by the vaccination campaign and a specific vaccination rate of 30 individuals per 10,000 population per day, with efficacy against symptomatic infection set to 95%. Various levels of pre-existing immunity were also assumed, ranging from 5% to 20%, depending on the region. In [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], the authors studied the optimal choice of vaccination strategy under a partial or complete lockdown. Each of the individuals appearing in their model had a pre-assigned daily routine, specified on the resolution of 1 hour, with the routine determining the order in which the individuals move between different locations, such as workplaces, schools, public places, hospitals and homes. The effect of vaccination combined with non-pharmaceutical interventions was also studied in [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], for the state of North Carolina, for interventions including reduced mobility, school closure and face mask usage. That article investigates scenarios under which vaccine efficacy takes the values of 50% or 90%. In our vaccination simulations, we will also consider variable efficacy, pre-existing immunity and limited daily capacity, together with other factors such as vaccine hesitancy.</p>
              <p>An extension of the present work would be to capture the economic and social costs of interventions and apply tools from machine learning to search for optimal strategies, as the authors of [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] did for their equation-based model. Machine learning has found a wide array of applications in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, both when building models from training data and feature extraction but also when searching for optimal strategies. The article [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] provides a review of deep learning applications for COVID-19, in the context of not only epidemiology but also natural language processing, computer vision and life sciences. For other applications of deep learning to the COVID-19 pandemic, see [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261330.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In many studies, it is assumed that all individuals comply perfectly with non-pharmaceutical interventions, while in reality this may not be the case. Adaptive agent behaviour can be accomplished using techniques from machine learning. See also [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] for a study of the effects of social learning on the transmission of COVID-19 in a network model. An approach utilising Bayesian techniques and a game theoretical modelling of adherence to restrictions was applied in [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], while the use of game theory and social network models for decision making on vaccination programmes was further emphasised in [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. For simplicity, we will assume perfect compliance with interventions, except face masks and vaccination.</p>
              <p>Some models have been formulated in terms of stochastic differential equations. For example, the article [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] presented an approach to modelling spatio-temporal vaccination strategies, wherein individuals move within a continuous space according to Brownian motion dynamics and, when they find themselves within a certain distance of one another, interact and potentially transmit the virus. Our model also features spatial dimensions, and could therefore also be used to investigate spatial strategies, for example ring vaccination, however this is beyond the scope of the present study.</p>
              <p>In comparison to other epidemiological models of COVID-19, ours is more detailed and dynamic than most, containing a wide range of locations, a fine time resolution of only 10 minutes and over 2000 behavioural types. These features allow our model to track the experiences of individual agents and capture the sort of brief encounters that take place outside of homes, work and schools, for example in shops and restaurants. A simpler model would fail to capture an equivalent level of heterogeneity, and would not allow for such intuitive implementations of interventions. For example, a lockdown is achieved in our model simply by sending agents home, rather than by estimating a reduction in daily contact counts or the effective reproduction number. Contact counts are a not an input of our model, but rather an output. Our model contains a broad set of interventions, including vaccination, and is the first agent-based model to be applied directly to the study of mass vaccination against COVID-19 in Luxembourg.</p>

              <p>Our model is written in Python. The code is organized around a modular framework, in which components represent submodels. This has the advantage that new components, such as additional interventions, can easily be added while existing components can be quickly updated or replaced. A communications system handles messages sent between the various components, a crucial feature since many of the interventions are required to interact with one another, while a scheduling system handles the timing of events such as lockdowns and testing regimes. The code is open source and available on GitHub at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/abm-covid-lux/abmlux" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/abm-covid-lux/abmlux</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>All input data is found in a single configuration file separate from the rest of the code. The file, <monospace>config.yaml</monospace>, can be found in the <monospace>Scenarios/Luxembourg</monospace> folder of the <monospace>abmlux</monospace> repository, and indicates precisely which values are taken by each of the parameters appearing in the model. Using this file we are able to configure the model to represent different scenarios. The configuration files corresponding to the scenarios appearing in the model evaluation and results sections can be found in the output repository <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/abm-covid-lux/output" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/abm-covid-lux/output</ext-link>. The model is flexible, but as with most agent-based models [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] has the limitation of long run times for large populations.</p>

                <p>Some locations types do not appear in these tables and are subject to special treatment. For example, the number of units of public transport is variable. A unit of public transport is defined to be either a bus or a carriage deck of a train or tram. A single-deck carriage consists of one unit, while a double-deck carriage consists of two units. The total number of buses and rail compartments operating in Luxembourg is derived from publicly accessible timetable data published by Mobilitéit. We used data referring to the period starting on 4th November 2019 and ending on 14th December 2019. Estimating average units per train at 10, average daily public transport availability in Luxembourg can then be visualized as in <xref rid="pone.0261330.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. This determines the number of accessible locations of type <bold>Public Transport</bold>.</p>

                <p>The number of locations of type <bold>House</bold> is determined by an algorithm that assigns agents to homes, to be described later. The number of locations of type <bold>Car</bold> is set equal to the number of houses, with each house being assigned one car. As with the units of public transport, the cars in our model are, for simplicity, static. The cars are simply locations in which agents are placed should they wish to use a car. In particular, agents living in the same house use the same car, no matter their destination. If an agent chooses to use public transport, then a unit of public transport is randomly selected among all those available at the time.</p>

                </fig>
                <p>To assign these coordinates, we first place a 1km square grid over the region in question, in our case Luxembourg. The grid we use is that of the ETRS89 reference frame. Each square is then assigned a weight, given by the number of people living in that square, according to Eurostat’s 2011 GEOSTAT initiative. Then, for each location we select a grid square by sampling this weighted two-dimensional distribution. This specifies the coordinates of each location to a resolution 1km. To determine the coordinates to a resolution of 1m, we then sample uniformly within the 1km square. The coordinates are used by agents when choosing which locations to visit. We assume agents will tend to prefer locations close to, for example, their home.</p>
                <p>We also have the option of sub-sampling the grid data to produce a grid of finer resolution. For example, with a resolution factor of 2, each original square with edge length 1km is replaced by four smaller squares each of edge length 500m. Population is then distributed among the small squares by linearly interpolating, with the option of setting the population of a small square equal to zero if there was no population present in the original square. Our population distribution model for Luxembourg, obtained using a resolution factor 2 and areas of zero population preserved, is illustrated as a heat map in <xref rid="pone.0261330.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, together with a sample distribution of locations.</p>
                <p>Since we set the spatial coordinates of a location by sampling the (interpolated) population distribution, we assume that all types of location are distributed as population is distributed. While this is approximately true, some location types are, in reality, subject to additional clustering. An improvement to the model would be therefore to assign coordinates using type specific spatial distributions, possibly achieved using additional OSM data, to produce a more realistic environment.</p>

                <p>In addition to the resident population, we also generate populations of non-resident commuters who live in neighbouring countries. Luxembourg shares borders with Belgium, France and Germany and large numbers of people travel across these borders every day for a variety of reasons. We focus on those who cross the border for work, since these are the individuals who typically spend large amounts of time in the region and who travel on a regular basis. We assume that populations of cross-border workers consist only of adults, that the age of cross-border workers is distributed identically to that of adults in the resident population, and that cross-border workers travel to the region for work and for no other reason. We do not model air travel nor other long distance connections between regions.

                <title>Activity choice</title>
                <p>Agents are able to perform various activities. Activity selection is based on time use data. The Harmonised European Time Use Surveys (HETUS) [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] are national surveys conducted in European countries to quantify how much time people spend on various activities, including paid work, household chores and family care, personal care, voluntary work, social life, travel and leisure. Similar data are collected in other parts of the world, for example the United States. Respondents to the European surveys were asked to record dairies of both a week day and a weekend day, with a time resolution of 10 minutes. In other words, for each respondent, the time use data specifies what the respondent was doing during each 10 minute interval of each day. The list of activities recognised by the survey is long and therefore simplified for our purposes, resulting in the following list of activities appearing in our model:</p>
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item>
                    <p><bold>Home, Visit, Work, School, Restaurant, Shopping, Outdoors, Car, Public Transport, Medical, Worship, Indoor Sport, Cinema or Theatre, Museum or Zoo</bold>.</p>
                  </list-item>
                </list>
                <p>The activity <bold>Home</bold> refers to all domestic activities, such as cleaning, cooking and sleeping. The activity <bold>Outdoors</bold> includes such things as going for a walk, riding a bike or playing outdoor sports. The activity <bold>Visit</bold> refers to visits of family or friends in other houses or care homes. The activity <bold>Medical</bold> refers to medical activities not related to the epidemic, and places agents either in hospital or a medical clinic. The other activities are self explanatory. We construct weekly routines by concatenating 2 copies of the weekend dairy with 5 copies of the weekday diary for each respondent, with the week starting on a Sunday. We therefore do not distinguish between Saturday and Sunday nor between weekdays. In the Luxembourg implementation, data is derived from the 2014 Luxembourg Time Use Survey. The resulting distribution of activities performed each week is illustrated below in <xref rid="pone.0261330.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>. Differences between weekend and weekday behaviour are clear, as are features such as rush hour, lunch breaks and increased time spent outdoors at the weekend.</p>

                </fig>
                <p>Since the age of respondents in the HETUS is known, we can assign agents weekly routines according to age. We do so by associating to each resident agent the routine of a respondent belonging to the same 10-year age bracket, randomly selected according to the statistical weights attached to data. This results, in the Luxembourg implementation, in over 2000 unique behavioural types. The minimum and maximum ages of respondents to the HETUS are 10 and 75, respectively, and we therefore introduce special rules for the very young and very old, in order to produce what we believe is a reasonable behavioural model covering agents of all ages.</p>
                <p>Since the resolution of the time use data is 10 minutes, a weekly routine can be thought of as a vector of length 1080, with entries specifying which activity is to be performed at each corresponding time. For example:
<disp-formula id="pone.0261330.e001"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0261330.e001.jpg" id="pone.0261330.e001g" position="anchor"/><mml:math id="M1" display="block" overflow="scroll"><mml:mtable displaystyle="true"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="right"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold">Home</mml:mtext><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold">Home</mml:mtext><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold">Work</mml:mtext><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold">Work</mml:mtext><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>⋯</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold">Restaurant</mml:mtext><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold">Home</mml:mtext><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:math></alternatives></disp-formula>
Each agent is assigned such a vector. We can put a distance on the space of all such routines by summing the number of entries in which the activities of two routines differ. Doing so we can perform hierarchical clustering to determine if there exist naturally occurring behavioural types. A distance threshold of 250 yields a total of 358 clusters, the three largest of which, labelled 77, 147 and 176, are illustrated below in <xref rid="pone.0261330.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>.</p>

                <p>Cross-border workers are assigned the canonical working routine given by the medoid of Cluster 77. This ensures that cross-border workers really do cross the border and go to work, since random sampling would have many of them performing other activities instead.</p>
                <p>We also experimented with a more complicated activity model where agents choose activities randomly. This involved aggregating routines in such a way as to produce transition matrices and corresponding time-inhomogeneous Markov chains, the sampling of which generates infinitely many behavioural patterns. The drawbacks of this approach are the computational cost and the possibility of sampling unrealistic routines, so for simplicity we decided to stick with the deterministic system described above, in which agents read off which activity to perform directly from their given routine vector.</p>
                <p>Having selected a preferred activity, an agent must then decide where to perform that activity. For example, if an agent decides to go <bold>Shopping</bold>, then the agent must choose a <bold>Shop</bold> at which to do the shopping. Agents are grouped into households and assigned a place of work, together with sets of locations at which they can perform the other activities.</p>

                <p>The home of an agent is the location in which they perform the activity <bold>Home</bold>. Home assignment begins by populating care homes with the oldest residents and by setting the home of non-residents to be their country of origin. We assume that each care home contains 38 residents. We will assume that no internal transmission occurs within the neighbouring countries, focussing instead on transmission within the central region only. Remaining resident agents are then assembled into households, with household composition for the Luxembourg model being determined using population structure data on families and households collected by STATEC for the 2001 census. Data on the numbers of children and retired individuals in houses of various sizes in Luxembourg is tabulated below, in <xref rid="pone.0261330.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>.</p>

                <p>Note that in our implementation, the categories 5+ and 7+ are suppressed as 5 and 7, respectively. The largest private household in our model of Luxembourg is therefore of size 7. Using only the data contained in these tables, we are able to construct a discrete probability distribution on household types. For a household of size <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>, a household type is a triple (<italic toggle="yes">c</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>) where <italic toggle="yes">c</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">a</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> denote the numbers of residents in the ages categories 0-14, 15-64 and 65+, respectively, with <italic toggle="yes">c</italic> + <italic toggle="yes">a</italic> + <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>.

For example, the pathway <bold>SEPCD</bold> describes an agent who having caught the virus passes through stages of pre-clinical and clinical infectiousness before dying from the disease outside of hospital. We assign to each agent a pathway, with probabilities determined by age. For the model of Luxembourg, these probabilities are derived from COVID-19 surveillance data managed by the General Inspectorate of Social Security in Luxembourg, collected during the first wave of COVID-19 cases in 2020. The age-dependent probabilities of an agent following the symptomatic pathways, conditional on that agent being symptomatic, are plotted in <xref rid="pone.0261330.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>. The probability that an agent follows the asymptomatic trajectory <bold>SEAR</bold> will be discussed later, in the subsection on model validation.</p>

                  <p>We split testing into a number of sub-processes. Firstly, there is a process representing large scale testing, which on certain dates distributes large numbers of test invitations. While this process is based on the system of large scale testing used in Luxembourg, where test invitations were not distributed completely randomly, we assume for simplicity that they are. We assume that there is a delay between agents receiving an invitation for large scale testing and the booking of the test. We assume this delay is distributed randomly as in <xref rid="pone.0261330.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>, the data for this having being collected by General Inspectorate of Social Security in Luxembourg in 2020.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, there is a process representing prescription testing, in which agents book a test one day after having developed symptoms. There is then a test booking system, which handles these booking requests. We assume that if an agent has symptoms then the test takes place two days after the booking, while if an agent does not have symptoms then, given a lesser sense of urgency, it takes place four days after the booking. A laboratory process then performs the tests, returning results after two days with a 1% probability of a false negative. In addition, we assume that the laboratory is only able to perform a limited number of tests per day, the exact capacity being scenario-specific.</p>

In the special case of care home closures, we allow agents access if they work at the care home, meaning that in this case only visits are prohibited, while in the special case of shops we permit each shop to stay open with a certain probability, since in reality not all shops close during a lockdown. Typically shops selling food, drink or fuel will remain open. According to [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], approximately 72% of shops in Luxembourg do not sell either food, drink or fuel.</p>

                  <title>Vaccination</title>
                  <p>Recall that at each tick of the simulation clock, in the absence of interventions, an agent <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> in health state <bold>Susceptible</bold> moves to state <bold>Exposed</bold> with probability <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">l</italic>) given by <xref rid="pone.0261330.e008" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq 1</xref>, where <italic toggle="yes">l</italic> denotes the current location of the agent. Our implementation of vaccination associates to each agent <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> a quantity <italic toggle="yes">v</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> ∈ {0, 1} and replaces the probability <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">l</italic>) by (1 − <italic toggle="yes">v</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>)<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">l</italic>). If <italic toggle="yes">v</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> = 1 then agent <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> is protected against infection, meaning that the health of agent <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> is protected against entering the state <bold>Exposed</bold>. Agents for whom <italic toggle="yes">v</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> = 1 are therefore unable to catch the virus, however agents who previously caught the virus, and are not yet either recovered or dead, are still able to transmit it. When an agent <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> is administered with a dose of the vaccine, with a certain probability <italic toggle="yes">v</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> is set equal to 1.</p>
                  <p>We assume the vaccine is administered in a two-dose format, with a fixed time between doses. We assume that the first and second doses protect the recipient with probabilities <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>2</sub>, respectively. Therefore, for an agent <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>, we have <italic toggle="yes">v</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> = 1 with probability <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>1</sub> after the first dose and with probability <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>1</sub> + (1 − <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>1</sub>)<italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>2</sub> after the second dose. For example, if the latter probability is set equal to 0.557, with <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>1</sub> set equal to 0.463, following [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], then we must set <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>2</sub> = 0.175. We use these probabilities to represent vaccine efficacy, meaning therefore efficacy against infection. We assume, for simplicity, that agents are either totally protected against infection or not at all.</p>
                  <p>Moreover we assume that everyone who receives a first dose later receives the second dose. We assume that only a certain number of first doses of the vaccine can be administered each day and that agents are vaccinated in a particular order. The default scheme starts with care home residents and care home workers, followed by hospital workers, followed by everyone else, with each of these categories ordered by age, down to a minimum age of 16. We also assume that agents refuse vaccination with a certain probability, depending on their age. Such hesitancy is realized in our model by randomly selecting agents and having these agents refuse the vaccine at the moment of injection.</p>

                <p>With the interventions and other components configured, it remains to calibrate the initial infection count, transmission probability and the age-dependent probabilities of asymptomatic infection.</p>
                <p>Initial conditions are set by randomly selecting a number of residents, and setting their initial health state to be the first infectious state appearing in their assigned disease pathway. This means, for example, that if a selected agent has disease pathway <bold>SEPCR</bold>, then their starting health state will be <bold>Pre-clinically Infectious</bold>. We assume there were 320 cases in Luxembourg on 23rd February 2020.</p>
                <p>Infected agents are either symptomatic or asymptomatic. During initialization, we assign agents the asymptomatic pathway <bold>SEAR</bold> with a probability that depends on their age. As a starting point for such probabilities, we take the numbers reported in [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Then, for each agent of age <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>, we have a probability <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">a</italic>) that the agent will be assigned <bold>SEAR</bold>. To account for uncertainty in these probabilities, we introduce a parameter <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> ∈ [0, 1] to interpolate between these probabilities and the extreme case in which all agents are asymptomatic. Given an agent of age <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>, the probability that they are assigned <bold>SEAR</bold> is then <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">a</italic>)(1 − <italic toggle="yes">s</italic>) + <italic toggle="yes">s</italic>. The parameter <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> gives us control over the probabilities of hospitalization and death, without disrupting the distributions visualized in <xref rid="pone.0261330.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>. In <xref rid="pone.0261330.g014" ref-type="fig">Fig 14</xref>, we plot the age-dependent asymptomatic probabilities for the three values <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> = 0, <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> = 0.2 and <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> = 0.4. While <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> = 0 corresponds exactly to the probabilities quoted in [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], our simulations suggest these probabilities are too low, and therefore our validation process will consider only <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> = 0.2 and <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> = 0.4.</p>

                <title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
                <p>We performed a simple univariate sensitivity analysis for the unknown parameters <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>, for the baseline scenario established above. Recall that <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> is the transmission probability while <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> is the parameter that controls the probability of being asymptomatic. We measured the sensitivity by estimating the partial derivatives, with respect to these two variables, of the total dead after 129 days. We also estimated the partial derivative with respect to the total number of care homes, since this is a quantity that we expect plays a significant role in determining the final outcome of the epidemic. We estimated the number of care homes in Luxembourg at 52, and now consider a variation in this number over the interval [10, 100]. We vary <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> over the interval [0.0, 0.8], with <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> = 0.4 corresponding to the baseline scenario, and we vary <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> over the interval [0.000175, 0.000525], with <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.000350 corresponding to the baseline scenario.

                <p>We see from <xref rid="pone.0261330.g017" ref-type="fig">Fig 17</xref> that the total number of deaths is not highly sensitive to independent variations of the parameters <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>. The relationships are, in fact, approximately affine linear. Therefore, since the primary objective of this article is to compare interventions against the baseline scenario, with the interventions being implemented on top of the baseline model in a very natural way, we do not expect our final conclusions to be highly sensitive to small variations of these parameters. In <xref rid="pone.0261330.g018" ref-type="fig">Fig 18</xref>, we plot the variation with respect to the number of care homes.</p>

                <p>Our model records not only the numbers of agents in each health state at each time, but also data on transmission events. In the baseline scenario, we found that approximately 12% of all agents caused secondary infections. Among those who did, the probability distribution of the number of secondary infections is displayed in <xref rid="pone.0261330.g022" ref-type="fig">Fig 22</xref>. While the majority of agents who caused secondary infections caused only 1 or 2, a few caused as many as 37, with these agents therefore playing the role of super spreaders. The majority of infections caused by these super spreaders occurred at work. Among all agents, the average number of secondary infections was 0.27 while among only those who caused at least one secondary infection the average was 2.14.</p>

Indeed, an agent-based model can always be represented as a system of differential equations, however the number of such equations would be enormous.</p>

In particular, we consider different levels of prescription testing, large scale testing and contact tracing, looking at low, medium and high intensities. In each of these three scenarios the test booking and laboratory systems are active, together with the quarantine intervention.

                <p>Rapidly containing an outbreak using these testing and contact tracing systems is difficult, partly because of delays, for example between onset of symptoms and the publishing of test results, and partly because the quarantining of individuals takes place at home, where they might expose other residents. In particular, since care home residents spend almost all of their time in the came home anyway, quarantining them there has little effect in our model.</p>

Indeed, according to the Luxembourg time use data, aggregated and displayed in <xref rid="pone.0261330.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, we see that during the relevant hours the vast majority of people are typically at home anyway. Moreover, <xref rid="pone.0261330.g025" ref-type="fig">Fig 25</xref> shows that mainly young people are out between these hours, except on weekday mornings when small numbers of adults of a broader range of ages are not at home, mostly commuting or starting work.</p>

We performed several simulations in which we assumed that a certain percentage of the population had pre-existing immunity. We selected these agents uniformly at random. In addition to two instances of the baseline scenario, where pre-existing immunity is 0%, we performed ten experiments in five pairs corresponding to levels of pre-exisiting immunity set at 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%. The simulations were otherwise parametrized as in the baseline scenario. For each pair, we averaged the two sets of outputs and the resulting numbers of cases and deaths are plotted in <xref rid="pone.0261330.g028" ref-type="fig">Fig 28</xref>.</p>

                  <p>Recalling that the baseline scenario results, on average, in around 23% of all agents infected, much lower than the 87% predicted by the SEIR model, we see from <xref rid="pone.0261330.g028" ref-type="fig">Fig 28</xref> that pre-existing immunity of only 30% already has a dramatic impact on reducing total cases and deaths. This suggests that relatively low levels of coverage can help protect a population from future outbreaks. A different situation is the one in which an epidemic is already under way, with vaccination occurring in response to it. This is the situation that will be considered next. Also, with a view towards COVID-19 vaccination programmes starting in early 2021, such as in Luxembourg where a significant proportion of the population is already immune having been previously exposed to the disease, we will assume for all subsequent experiments that 10% of the population have pre-existing immunity. It was therefore necessary to perform ten additional simulations of the baseline scenario with 10% pre-existing immunity, with this new baseline being the one appearing in all subsequent figures.</p>

                  <p>Consider the situation where vaccination begins 3 weeks into the epidemic. We assume that vaccines are distributed first to care home residents and workers, followed by hospital workers, followed by all other agents according to age, down to a minimum age of 16. We will assume no vaccine hesitancy and that the number of first doses available each day is equivalent to 0.6% of the total population. In the Luxembourg implementation, this yields a constant daily capacity of 4864 first doses. We will assume that each vaccine is administered in two doses, precisely 3 weeks apart. We will consider three vaccines, of low, medium and high efficacy, for which we assume that after the first dose these vaccines provide protection against infection with probabilities 0.450, 0.675 and 0.900, respectively, increasing after the second dose to 0.55, 0.75 and 0.95, respectively. If <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>2</sub> denote the probabilities that the first and second doses successfully protect against infection, then the values of the pair (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>2</sub>) corresponding to the low, medium and high efficacies are therefore (0.450, 0.182), (0.675, 0.231) and (0.900, 0.500) since, according to our simple model of vaccination, if administered as a single dose the vaccines have efficacy <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>1</sub> while after two doses the efficacy increases to <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>1</sub> + (1 − <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>1</sub>)<italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>2</sub>.

                  <title>Hesitancy</title>
                  <p>For the medium efficacy vaccine with medium daily capacity, administered according to the same strategy, we now consider the impact of low, medium and high levels of vaccine hesitancy. In particular, we assume that with a certain probability agents refuse the vaccine when offered it. We assume that these probabilities are age dependent and that they remain constant throughout the simulation. An online survey conducted by science.lu in Luxembourg in December 2021 [<xref rid="pone.0261330.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] suggested that vaccine hesitancy levels were fairly high in Luxembourg, with only 55% of participants being likely or very likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Breaking down by age, the survey suggested that in the age group 13-34, only 48% were likely or very likely to get vaccinated, 57% in the age group 35-64 and 80% in the age group 65+.</p>
                  <p>For our simulations, we decompose according to the same age groups with low, medium and high vaccine hesitancy levels for each age group parametrized as in <xref rid="pone.0261330.t012" ref-type="table">Table 12</xref>. For example, for the low hesitancy scenario we assume that agents aged 65+ refuse the vaccine with probability 0.10, while for the high hesitancy scenario we assume agents aged 16-34 refuse the vaccine with probability 0.75, representing the two extremes. The medium hesitancy scenario corresponds roughly to the data collected in the Luxembourg survey, while the probabilities for the low and high hesitancy scenarios are obtained by interpolating half way between the medium scenario and the two extreme cases of zero and total hesitancy.</p>

                  <p>We see from <xref rid="pone.0261330.g031" ref-type="fig">Fig 31</xref> that high levels of hesitancy result in considerably more deaths than medium or low hesitancy. That being said, the levels of hesitancy corresponding to our high hesitancy scenario are, in some sense, very high. We assumed hesitancy levels to be constant throughout the simulation, although in reality hesitancy levels can change over time. For example, as more people are vaccinated, hesitancy levels might decrease as familiarity with the vaccine increases. On the other hand, as more people are vaccinated the likelihood of somebody experiencing unusual side effects of the vaccine increases, with news of this potentially increasing hesitancy levels. While we have assumed a model of vaccine hesitancy that acts on the level of the individual, hesitancy can also manifest itself at a higher level, with policy makers themselves hesitant to implement the vaccine. Moreover, we have only simulated the use of a single vaccine. A future study would have several being administered simultaneously, starting on different dates, with different properties and with potentially different levels of hesitancy associated to them. Such considerations are beyond the scope of the present study.</p>

                  <p>Finally, for the medium efficacy vaccine with medium daily capacity and no hesitancy, we now consider three different allocation strategies. The first, a simplified version of the priority scheme used in the other experiments, first allocates vaccines to the age group 65+ and then to the age group 16-64, proceeding in a random order within each group. The second distributes vaccines randomly to the entire age group 16+. The third starts with 16-64 and then moves onto 65+, the opposite of the first strategy. We expected that the strategy that prioritizes young people would lead to the largest reduction in cases, while the strategy that prioritizes old people would lead to the largest reduction in deaths.

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Based on the results presented and discussed in the previous section, we now draw several conclusions. We do so keeping in mind the limitations of our model, and the assumptions on which it is based. Our basic conclusions are listed as follows:</p>

                <list-item>
                  <p>Our agent-based model predicts far fewer cases than the basic SEIR model. The latter assumes homogeneous mixing and therefore represents only an upper bound, with the heterogeneities captured by our model explaining the difference. Our model predicts only around 25% as many cases as the SEIR model.</p>

                  <p>Testing and contract tracing flatten the epidemic peak, but their impact in reducing deaths is limited.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>A full lockdown, although economically and socially very costly, dramatically reduces both cases and deaths. Alternatives to the full lockdown are also available, not as effective but less costly in terms of their economic disruption. The impact of an 11pm-6am curfew is relatively small.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>When vaccinating against a future outbreak, herd immunity is achieved at levels much lower than those predicted by the simple SEIR model. Under certain assumptions, our model predicts that substantial levels of protection are achieved with only 30% of the population immune.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>When vaccinating in midst of an outbreak, the task is more difficult. In this context, the impact of vaccination in reducing cases is less, however the impact in reducing deaths remains high. A low efficacy vaccine is almost as good as a high efficacy vaccine, from the point of view of reducing deaths, although this conclusion is somewhat dependent on our interpretation of efficacy. As regards daily capacity, even with only a low number of doses administered each day the impact on deaths can be relatively high, so long as these doses are targeted at the most vulnerable individuals. High vaccine hesitancy results in considerably more deaths than would occur with low vaccine hesitancy and is the most serious challenge to a successful vaccination programme.</p>
                </list-item>
              </list>
              <p>While in the previous section we considered independent variations in vaccine efficacy, daily capacity and hesitancy, in order to assess their individual impact, it is also worth considering the impact of a mixed variation of these parameters. In particular, we consider also the best and worse case scenarios, with the best case corresponding to high efficacy, high capacity and low hesitancy and the worse case corresponding to low efficacy, low capacity and high hesitancy. Performing ten simulations for each scenario, starting the vaccinations 3 weeks into the outbreak as before, we plot the average cases and deaths in <xref rid="pone.0261330.g033" ref-type="fig">Fig 33</xref>, as well as the averages for the baseline scenario in which no vaccination occurs. What we conclude from this is that in the worst case scenario the vaccination programme essentially fails, while in the best case scenario the vaccination programme is extremely successful at reducing deaths, the main factor here being vaccine hesitancy, with efficacy and capacity being nonetheless significant. Even in the best case scenario, when vaccinating in the midst of an explosive outbreak, there will still be large numbers of new cases many weeks after the start of the vaccination programme, however the peak will be smaller and occur sooner.</p>

              <p>Let us finish with some final remarks about the limitations of the model and directions for future research. Firstly, confidence in our results would be further improved with a more sophisticated statistical analysis of uncertainty, which would require several computational optimizations, in order to reduce runtime. This may involve validating our model using data collected in other countries, besides only Luxembourg. Obtaining all the data necessary to do this is difficult, and was therefore deemed beyond the scope of the present work.</p>
              <p>Moreover our behavioural model could be further enhanced, by introducing correlations between individuals, for example families, and with agent behaviour adjusting automatically in response to a pandemic event, even in the absence of organized interventions.</p>
              <p>One notable limitation of our study, is that our interpretation of vaccine efficacy is relatively simple, based on an all-or-nothing model of immunity. A more sophisticated model of immunity, distinguishing immunity against infection from immunity against transmission, and also immunity against symptomatic illness or severe disease, would be more realistic and could lead to interesting conclusions. We have also not considered factors such as partial immunity, waning immunity, cross immunity for multiple variants and multiple vaccines. The all-or-nothing model of immunity is assumed for simplicity, with this assumption often being found in the literature.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, new strains of COVID-19 present new challenges, but we have not simulated the impact of different strains, nor attempted to model competition between strains. We speculate that social distancing and testing exert an evolutionary pressure on the virus that increases the reward for any mutation that makes the virus more transmissible or less easily detected. The simulation of such a competitive system is an objective for future research, with uncertainties surrounding the strains a major reason why we have not made any concrete predictions about the future. Since we are ourselves a part of the system that we are trying to model, and therefore not independent from it, to a certain extent we would be doomed to fail anyway.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, our results reinforce the widely held view that vaccination is the most effective intervention against COVID-19. Lockdowns are extremely costly, both socially and economically, with other non-pharmaceutical interventions having only a limited impact. Vaccination represents the best hope we have to free ourselves from this deadly virus, our final conclusion being that a positive and progressive approach to vaccination is essential.</p>

                <title>Purpose and patterns</title>
                <p>The purpose of this model is to explore the impact of interventions, in particular vaccination, on cases and deaths due to COVID-19. The intention is to help decision makers understand the relative strengths of interventions when used in combination with one another. The model has been configured to represent Luxembourg and therefore the patterns that the model has been assessed against were observed in Luxembourg during the first few months of the pandemic. This includes, in particular, the drops in cases and deaths seen after multiple strict measures were introduced in March 2020.</p>

                <title>Process overview and scheduling</title>
                <p>Our model is configured to run for a fixed number of iterations, with each iteration representing a 10 minute interval of time. During each iteration of this main loop, interventions are updated according to a schedule and internal message and telemetry buses are notified of world updates occurring since the last tick of the simulation clock. Components are notified of the new time, to which they might then respond. For example, it might be time for the movement model to request that an agent moves to visit a care home, but a lockdown intervention listening to such requests overrides the request, requesting instead that the agent returns home. The disease model loops over all locations and determines if any new infections take place, requesting health state updates if so. Once these requests have been resolved via the message bus, world updates are enacted and the simulation moves onto the next tick, with the simulation finally ending after the predetermined number of ticks.</p>

                  <title>Basic principles</title>
                  <p>The model implements a conventional compartmental disease model within the bottom-up approach of an agent-based model. The compartmental disease model is familiar and easily understood, while the agent-based approach provides a more detailed and flexible model of social interactions than can be achieved with the equation-based approach. In particular, the agent-based approach allows for an intuitive and realistic implementation of interventions. This is much more difficult to achieve at the aggregated level of a small system of differential equations. Another basic principle of our model, and one that influenced its design, is adaptability. Our model is built on a modular framework, with components communicating with one another via a message bus, having the advantage that components can be easily added or replaced, transforming the model with ease to describe new regions, diseases or interventions.</p>

                  <title>Emergence</title>
                  <p>Emergence is a concept that sits at the heart of our approach to modelling. Behaviour is described on an individual basis, with routines sampled from a pool of over 2000 possibilities, yielding an extremely complex system of collation and movement. By simulating an infectious disease spreading within such as system, we observe the resulting epidemic as an emergent phenomenon. The set of all possible sequences of interactions between agents is extremely large, with certain sequences having a dramatic effect on the total number of deaths. A chain of interactions ending in a care home might, for example, be of this type.</p>

                <sec id="sec045">
                  <title>Adaptation</title>
                  <p>Agents in our model do not adapt their routines willingly. If a routine is disrupted, it is because an intervention has over-ridden it. In other words, in the absence of interventions agents will behave as if oblivious to the epidemic. Adaptive routines, based on learning objectives and prediction might enhance the model, but would be very difficult to parametrize.</p>

                  <title>Sensing</title>
                  <p>Components, such as the disease model and the interventions, collect data on the world and respond accordingly. This is achieved via the message bus, the system of information exchange to which components can subscribe and publish events. The stream of communications between the components results from the interactions of the agents and the disease model, and therefore represents an emergent collection of events.</p>

                  <title>Interaction</title>
                  <p>If two agents occupy the same location for the same 10 minute interval, then it is assumed that an interaction occurs that with some probability results in disease transmission. The nature of this interaction is assumed to be uniform across all location types. While in reality location type or activity might be important factors in determining the probability of transmission, in the absence of relevant data we make no such hypotheses, assuming uniformity of interactions for simplicity.</p>

                  <title>Stochasticity</title>
                  <p>Stochasticity is used throughout our model, during both initialization and simulation. The world is procedurally generated, with locations distributed and populated by sampling probability distributions. For each agent, movement is determined by the random selection of locations belonging to certain lists, while disease transmission is also the result of random, binomial, sampling. Via repeated sampling, stochasticity washes away outliers that may arise form a particular configuration. Much care was taken to ensure that our experiments can be repeated and the results replicated, by keeping track of the random seeds used by the psuedo-random number generators appearing in our code.</p>

                  <p>Agents routines are sampled from a finite pool, and therefore some agents behave very similarly. In addition, agents living in the same house will tend to visit similar nearby locations. These correlations, however, are not the result of emergent collective behaviour, being instead consequences of the configuration process.</p>

                <title>Initialization</title>
                <p>Initialization begins by creating a map of the region. This includes a model of population density. This is followed by the creation of the world, based on the map, which involves distributing locations and populating them with agents. Having created the world and a clock object, to keep track of time, the remaining components of the model are then initialized. These components are the disease model, the activity model, the movement model and the interventions. For example, during the initialization phase it is determined who will die if infected, who will work night shifts and who will refuse a vaccine. With the initialization phase completed, the simulation begins.</p>
                <p>More precisely, having constructed the map object, the world is built in the following order:</p>
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Resident agents are created and assigned an age and nationality.</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>Neighbouring countries and populations of cross-border workers are created, with these adults being assigned an age and nationality. These agents will perform all activities other than work in their home country.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Agents are assigned a place of work, to which they will move if performing the work activity.</p>

                  <list-item>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>Resident agents are assigned a number of cinemas or theatres and museums or zoos that they may visit during the simulation. These are sampled randomly from all such locations in the region.</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>Resident agents are assigned primary and secondary schools, to which they move if performing the school activity, and also a medical clinic, place of worship and indoor sports center. Locations of these types are assigned based on proximity, unless the location has already been assigned its fair share of agents, in which case the next nearest available location is chosen. This is to avoid overcrowding, ensuring that the number of agents visiting these locations is balanced.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>

                <p>The procedure described above therefore assigns to each agent and for each activity a list of locations from which the agent can randomly choose when performing that activity during the simulation. It therefore remains to initialize the aforementioned components:</p>

A number of resident agents are randomly infected and their health state set accordingly. These will be the initial cases that get the epidemic started.</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>The activity model assigns to each agent a weekly routine, sampled from over 2000 such routines with a 10 minute resolution. These routines distinguish between weekdays and weekends. The initial activity of each agent is set accordingly, together with an initial location.</p>

                    <p>The contact tracing system initializes, determining for each agent a list of regular contacts.

                    <p>The test laboratory, test booking and prescription testing systems initialize, collecting information on health states from the disease model.

                  <list-item>
                    <p><bold>World Factory</bold>: The world factory creates agents and locations and for each agent assigns for each activity a list of locations to which the agent can move during the simulation. These lists are determined beforehand since otherwise the computational cost would be too high when dealing with large populations.</p>

                    <p><bold>Message Bus</bold>: The message bus allows components to communicate through a shared set of interfaces. Communications are either requests or notifications. Requests are made to, for example, begin a new activity, move to a new location or book a test. Other components might cancel these requests, issuing their own requests in response. Once such disagreements are all resolved, with the state of the world updated accordingly, notifications are sent through the message bus informing components of these changes. The message bus was implemented to account for the fact that interventions must interact with one another when several are simultaneously active. There is also a telemetry system, operating on the same principles as the message bus, that collects and saves data from the simulation for analysis.</p>

For example, once an agent has received their first dose of the vaccine, the administration of the second dose is added to the deferred event pool, as an event due to take place on a particular date several weeks after the first. On that date, the system will then issue a request to the message bus, triggering the vaccination system to actually perform the second dose.</p>

This is necessary since model validation requires the reproduction of measures introduced in Luxembourg during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, with various quantities associated to these measures being variable. For example, daily testing was variable, while places of work, schools and other locations were closed on certain dates and reopened on others.</p>

                    <p><bold>Disease Model</bold>: The disease model was designed according to the familiar compartmental framework but in such as way that avoids geometrically distributed periods of time spent in each health state. Rather than using stochasticity on each tick to decide who moves into the next health state, disease progression for each agent is determined during initialization, allowing for a richer and more realistic variety of patterns. On each tick, the transmission model loops through all locations and determines who, if anyone, is to be newly exposed. More precisely, it counts how many infectious agents are in a given location, distinguishing between symptomatics and asymptomatics, and loops through the susceptible agents in that location, sampling binomial distributions to determine if those agents are to be infected. If infections occur, the system then decides, via random selection, who exactly caused each infection. The algorithm is so ordered to optimize runtime, with the identification of the infecting agent needed only for telemetry and testing purposes.</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p><bold>Activity Model</bold>: The activity model was designed to give agents interesting, varied and realistic daily and weekly routines. Assigning these routines during initialization lowers the computational cost, versus a system that for each agent chooses activities stochastically. Such a system, based on Markov chains, was previously implemented in our model, but was replaced due to the computational burden and the fact that, after repeated testing, did not appear to be sufficiently advantageous.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p><bold>Movement Model</bold>: As stated above, the world factory determines lists of locations that agents might visit. In the event that that an agent starts a new activity, the movement model simply selects a location at random from the appropriate list.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p><bold>Hospitalization</bold>: This hospitalization intervention moves agents to hospital if their health transitions to a state demanding hospitalization. This intervention is relatively simple, and does feature hospital or ICU capacity, such constraints being omitted due to parametrization uncertainties. The hospitalization intervention also takes care of agents who have died, moving them to the cemetery. Dead agents are moved to the cemetery to avoid them being erroneously counted as inhabiting other locations.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p><bold>Test Booking System</bold>: The testing system is quite large and therefore divided into several subsystems. The test booking system handles requests to get tested. The test events themselves are scheduled via the deferred event pool.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p><bold>Testing Laboratory</bold>: The laboratory system performs the tests, handling deferred test event requests, published through the message bus. If the daily limit of tests has been reached, then subsequent tests that day are simply not performed. If a test takes place, the result of the test is published to the message bus for other components to see.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p><bold>Prescription Testing</bold>: Tests are booked in our model for one of two reasons. The first is that an agent has developed symptoms, detected if a health state transition has been published to the message bus in which an agent is symptomatic having not previously been so.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p><bold>Large Scale Testing</bold>: The other circumstance in which an agent books a test is after they have been invited to do so by the large scale testing system. For simplicity, our implementation of this system distributed tests at random. Once an invitation has been received, agents respond by booking a test after a delay. It was important to include this delay since data collected in Luxembourg shows that this period of time is often quite substantial.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p><bold>Contact Tracing</bold>: The contact tracing system responds to newly published test results. If the result of a test is positive, the system issues test booking and quarantine requests to regular contacts of the relevant agent. More detailed implementations of contact tracing are possible, and were tested, however the system described seems to provide a good balance between realism and runtime when simulating very large numbers of individuals.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p><bold>Quarantine</bold>: The quarantine model holds a list of agents who are subject to quarantine restrictions. Agents are added to the list if a quarantine request is made, which occurs either via the contact tracing system or if an agent tests positive. Agents are removed form the list once their period of quarantine is over, a period which can be reduced if the agent should happen to get a negative test result. The quarantine system interacts with the movement model by overriding requests to leave home if an agent is in the quarantine list. In particular, we assume that agents completely adhere to the quarantine rules.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p><bold>Location Closure</bold>: The location closure system interacts with the movement model in a way that is similar to the quarantine system. If an agent requests to move to a location that is, as determined by the scheduler, currently off limits, then that request is denied with the agent being sent home instead. The only exception here is care homes, with agents still permitted access to a care home if they happen to work there.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p><bold>Curfew</bold>: The curfew system is very similar to the location closure system, acting on list of disallowed locations which in this case includes everything except hospitals and the cemetery. The difference is that the curfew, on days when it is enabled, is only active between certain hours.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p><bold>Vaccination</bold>: This system incorporates several features that were deemed to be of most importance. One such feature is vaccine hesitancy, representing the fact that not everybody wants to get vaccinated. The probability of refusal is determined by age. Another is variable efficacy, representing an increased efficacy after the second dose of a two-dose vaccine. The system also features a priority list, representing systems in which limited supplies of vaccine are allocated to certain individuals before others, according to age, residency or place of work. Vaccinations run on a daily cycle, with a deferred event pool and the message bus being used to schedule the administration of second doses. The vaccination model was designed to encompass such a level of detail since an examination of the impact of vaccination was one of the main objectives of the study.</p>

              <p>Estimating the impact of interventions against COVID-19: from lockdown to vaccination</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Thompson,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Based on the reviewers' comments, I recommend that you make substantial revisions to your manuscript. This should include improving the description of the model environment and how the agents interact in it. Please also be clear on how the sensitivity analysis was carried out and in reporting the outcome of this analysis. Then resubmit your improved version of the manuscript after making the revisions as advised in this letter.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jun 19 2021 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>.

              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The author presented a sophisticated, detailed agent-based model of Covid-19 transmission in Luxembourg. It evaluated a number of interventions to control the spread of Covid-19 in the community and compared the outcomes with other published models in the discussions. The study covered an important topic and included the verification and validation which help build confidence in the model. The inclusion of ODD protocol for the model help reading and understanding the model descriptions easier and more efficient and make it easier to replicate.</p>
              <p>There are a number of issues that I would like the authors to clarify:</p>
              <p>1. The paper discussed the sensitivity of the number of dead to the distribution of care homes, and the sensitivity of our model with respect to the probability of being asymptomatic and the transmission probability.</p>
              <p>Which parameters is each model outcome sensitive to?</p>
              <p>Which approach did the authors use to perform sensitivity analysis (e.g. univariate, multivariate, or probabilistic)?</p>
              <p>I suggest the authors to include a table that summarizes the values of model parameters in the baseline scenario and the distributions used in sensitivity analysis.</p>
              <p>2. How was the vaccine efficacy implemented in the model not very clear?</p>
              <p>- Did the authors refer to the vaccine efficacy in this paper as efficacy against confirmed Covid-19 case or efficacy against transmission?</p>
              <p>- What state variables of agents were affected if they are vaccinated? (Did the vaccinated agents have their state of infection changed from Susceptible to Recovered/Immune at the probability p1 and p2?)</p>
              <p>- How did vaccination affect the transmission if susceptible vaccinated individuals come into contact with infected individuals and their disease progression if infected?</p>
              <p>3. The number of simulations (ten) performed for each scenario seem quite small for a highly stochastic model like this model. I appreciate the extensive runtime for this high-resolution agent-based model. However, how did you decide that 10 simulations were sufficient to capture the true behaviours of the system? Would reducing the resolution and increasing the number of simulations produce outcomes with less uncertainty?</p>
              <p>4. I appreciate that it is a very sophisticated and detailed model. However, would the purposes of the study be achieved with a simpler model such as a stochastic compartment model or an ABM with simpler structure? The authors mentioned that some of their results were similar to results from other studies which using simpler models. In this case, what would be the justification for building a more complex model?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The paper presents a detailed agent-based model that simulates COVID-19 pandemic dynamics over a small country, drawing very interesting results. The proposed system has agents with a high level of detail of the human interactions and routines, a great diversity of spatial locations and their intrinsic impacts, and it is very customizable. The methodology includes a consistent estimation of the parameters and used the classic SEIR model as a baseline, showing higher accurate inferential performance. However, some improvements must be made before its publishing.</p>
              <p>The overall text is well written but sometimes exaggerates in length, and many paragraphs could be replaced by a diagram, a table, etc, reducing the length of the text and yet improving the readability of the results.</p>
              <p>There is a problem with the location and quality of the images in the review text that harmed the reading and understanding of the text. All images appeared at the end of the text, which is inopportune. I suggest fixing this issue for the next review rounds.</p>
              <p>In the State of Art section I think is missing a lot of recent machine learning and ABM models. This section can be improved with a deeper revision of recent research of agent-based epidemiological simulation of COVD19.</p>
              <p>In the Methods section, the authors focused on the semantic meaning of the system components, which is perfectly understandable given the scope of the research. However, a little bit more details about the software implementation could improve the text and help the readers interested in implement or even employ the model. On the other hand, some descriptions of the model behavior (e. g. the school and classes descriptions) could be abbreviated.</p>
              <p>Or you simply share the link of the source code or you should remove from the text the promise of opening the code in the future.</p>
              <p>The authors let it clear in the text that the ABM has a network structure. But the Locations subsection gives the impression that the software is grid-oriented. How explicitly occur the relationships between the locations and the agents? How are they represented? Along with the text, the authors recovered the notion of a network model but in a fashion hard to understand. A good example is a car using by the agents. There will be a unique car location shared by all agents? I think that including a Network Diagram in this section, showing a small sample of the agents and their interactions will help the readers to understand better how your model works.</p>
              <p>The ODD protocol in Appendix has an interesting high-level description of the whole system. However, I still miss some logical diagrams of the software structure and architecture (maybe a UML package diagram, or a component diagram ?)</p>
              <p>In Model Evaluation and Validation, much of these paragraphs can be simplified or synthesized using mathematical formulas or replaced by a table with the parameters and their sources.</p>
              <p>The results are very interesting but are spread in text and should be synthesized in a table, with the results of the proposed model and the SEIR model side by side, together with a statistical significance test of the difference between them.</p>
              <p>Finally, I think this research is very interesting and opportune and their insights are very important and worth publishing after improving the paper.</p>

              </p>
              <p>My co-author and I welcome the comments on our paper `Estimating the impact of interventions against COVID-19: from lockdown to vaccination'. We appreciate the thorough and insightful quality of the reviews and have improved our article accordingly, with substantial revisions. We have improved the description of the model environment and how the agents interact in it, and released the code for our model in a public repository:</p>
              <p>
                <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/abm-covid-lux/abmlux" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/abm-covid-lux/abmlux</ext-link>
              </p>
              <p>All input and output data, underlying the findings in the manuscript, are now fully available. The input data can be found in the above repository, while the output data, used to create the plots and tables in the manuscript, is located in a separate public repository:</p>
              <p><ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/abm-covid-lux/output" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/abm-covid-lux/output</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>We have now made clear how the sensitivity analysis was carried out and reported the outcome of this analysis. We have performed 790 additional simulations, on top of the 290 performed for the original manuscript, and included additional statistical analysis.</p>
              <p>Detailed responses to the comments of the reviewers are as follows:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1</p>
              <p>1. `The paper discussed the sensitivity of the number of dead to the distribution of care homes, and the sensitivity of our model with respect to the probability of being asymptomatic and the transmission probability. Which parameters is each model outcome sensitive to? Which approach did the authors use to perform sensitivity analysis (e.g. univariate, multivariate, or probabilistic)? I suggest the authors to include a table that summarizes the values of model parameters in the baseline scenario and the distributions used in sensitivity analysis.'</p>
              <p>Response: We have added a subsection on Sensitivity Analysis to end of the Model Evaluation section. The analysis performed was univariate. We estimated the partial derivatives of total deaths with respect to the probability of being asymptomatic, the transmission probability, and also the total number of care homes. We have plotted the relevant mappings, using output data from a large number of additional simulations. These plots illustrate that our model is not highly sensitive to independent variations in these parameters. Therefore, since the primary objective of this article is to compare interventions against the baseline scenario, with the interventions being implemented on top of the baseline model in a very natural way, we do not expect our final conclusions to be highly sensitive to small variations in these parameters. A more sophisticated analysis is currently out of reach, due to the long runtime of the model.</p>
              <p>2. `How was the vaccine efficacy implemented in the model not very clear? Did the authors refer to the vaccine efficacy in this paper as efficacy against confirmed Covid-19 case or efficacy against transmission? What state variables of agents were affected if they are vaccinated? (Did the vaccinated agents have their state of infection changed from Susceptible to Recovered/Immune at the probability p1 and p2?) How did vaccination affect the transmission if susceptible vaccinated individuals come into contact with infected individuals and their disease progression if infected?'</p>
              <p>Response: The subsection on vaccination, appearing in the methods section, has now been rewritten to make this all much clearer. Efficacy in our model refers to the probability of being protected against infection, after receiving a dose of the vaccine. The health of protected individuals is blocked from making the state transition Susceptible to Exposed. Protected individuals are neither able to catch the virus nor transmit it, unless they are infected at the time of vaccination in which case they are still able to transmit it.</p>
              <p>3. `The number of simulations (ten) performed for each scenario seem quite small for a highly stochastic model like this model. I appreciate the extensive runtime for this high-resolution agent-based model. However, how did you decide that 10 simulations were sufficient to capture the true behaviours of the system? Would reducing the resolution and increasing the number of simulations produce outcomes with less uncertainty?'</p>
              <p>Response: We have now increased the number of simulations for the baseline scenario from 10 to 100, as illustrated in Fig 17 and Fig 18, with several hundred additional simulations added to other subsections. The output distributions are concentrated around the mean and the sample variance is low, with the variance being much higher for low-resolution scaled versions of the model. This is a feature of the model that we observed early in the project, so given constraints on both time and resources, we decided on a small number of high resolution simulations, as opposed to a large number of low resolution simulations. Moreover, simulating with a high time resolution was necessary to properly implement the interventions and to capture brief encounters taking place outside the home, work or school.</p>
              <p>4. `I appreciate that it is a very sophisticated and detailed model. However, would the purposes of the study be achieved with a simpler model such as a stochastic compartment model or an ABM with simpler structure? The authors mentioned that some of their results were similar to results from other studies which using simpler models. In this case, what would be the justification for building a more complex model?'</p>
              <p>Response: Some of the purposes of the study could have been achieved with a simpler model, however only a detailed agent-based model is capable of supporting the full range of scenarios that we wanted to investigate. As the pandemic unfolded, the detail in the model was useful, and this shaped some of the design. With a stochastic compartmental model, or a simpler ABM, it would have been much more difficult to model all of the interventions simultaneously and realistically. The structure of our code is actually quite simple, and allows for the interventions to be modelled in a transparent and intuitive way. For example, instead of representing a lockdown using a reduction in a contact rate parameter, as is done in some models, in our model a lockdown simply directs agents home, which is more intuitive. Moreover, our model is able to capture a much higher level of heterogeneity than would be possible using a simpler compartmental model. This is an important point since these heterogeneities result in significant differences in output, as shown in Fig 19 and Table 8 of our revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2</p>
              <p>1. `The overall text is well written but sometimes exaggerates in length, and many paragraphs could be replaced by a diagram, a table, etc, reducing the length of the text and yet improving the readability of the results.'</p>
              <p>Response: Several paragraphs have now been reduced in length, and some omitted altogether. We have introduced a number of additional tables, as suggested, in particular Tables 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. We agree that the text was in places rather verbose, so several paragraphs have been rewritten more concisely.</p>
              <p>2. `There is a problem with the location and quality of the images in the review text that harmed the reading and understanding of the text. All images appeared at the end of the text, which is inopportune. I suggest fixing this issue for the next review rounds.'</p>
              <p>Response: The images appeared at the end of the text to meet the requirements of the journal, however it does make the article difficult to read, so in the revised version we have reinserted the images directly into the text. This should also avoid any loss in image quality, which we suspect occurred during the image submission process. Moreover, we have converted our figure files using the PACE digital diagnostic tool, as suggested by the editor.</p>
              <p>3. `In the State of Art section I think is missing a lot of recent machine learning and ABM models. This section can be improved with a deeper revision of recent research of agent-based epidemiological simulation of COVID-19.'</p>
              <p>Response: We have now performed a much deeper review of relevant literature and have essentially rewritten the State of Art section. We now refer to a much broader range of literature, including many agent-based models of COVID-19 not referred to at all in the original version, and have inserted a paragraph specifically focussed on machine learning and epidemic modelling of COVID-19. Overall, 49 new references have been added to the manuscript.</p>
              <p>4. `In the Methods section, the authors focused on the semantic meaning of the system components, which is perfectly understandable given the scope of the research. However, a little bit more details about the software implementation could improve the text and help the readers interested in implement or even employ the model. On the other hand, some descriptions of the model behavior (e. g. the school and classes descriptions) could be abbreviated. Or you simply share the link of the source code or you should remove from the text the promise of opening the code in the future.'</p>
              <p>Response: Our code is now freely accessible on GitHub, together with all the documentation and input data required for other users to run the simulations. In addition, we have added some equations to the Methods section to help clarify the exposition, while abbreviating some other paragraphs, including the school and classroom descriptions.</p>
              <p>5. `The authors let it clear in the text that the ABM has a network structure. But the Locations subsection gives the impression that the software is grid-oriented. How explicitly occur the relationships between the locations and the agents? How are they represented? Along with the text, the authors recovered the notion of a network model but in a fashion hard to understand. A good example is a car using by the agents. There will be a unique car location shared by all agents? I think that including a Network Diagram in this section, showing a small sample of the agents and their interactions will help the readers to understand better how your model works.'</p>
              <p>Response: We agree that the talk of networks was somewhat misleading, so we have rewritten parts of the Introduction and the Locations subsection accordingly. In particular, unlike some agent-based models, our model is not based on networks. The Spatial Distribution and Location Choice subsections have also been rewritten, to help clarify the relationship between agents and locations and the role played by the grid (when initializing the random environment, locations are assigned coordinates to a resolution of 1m, first by selecting a 1km grid square and then by sampling uniformly within that square, with this being the only role played by the grid). To address the final point about network diagrams, we have now included a new figure, Fig 7, which for three randomly selected agents plots their home and personal locations on the map of the region. The line segments in Fig 7 simply illustrate the distance between an agent's home and the other locations, the agents being able to travel between these locations in any order.</p>
              <p>6. `The ODD protocol in Appendix has an interesting high-level description of the whole system. However, I still miss some logical diagrams of the software structure and architecture (maybe a UML package diagram, or a component diagram ?)'</p>
              <p>Response: We hope that the releasing of our code in a documented repository satisfies this requirement. We can provide a UML package diagram or a component diagram if required, possibly in exchange for relaxation of any length limits.</p>
              <p>7. `In Model Evaluation and Validation, much of these paragraphs can be simplified or synthesized using mathematical formulas or replaced by a table with the parameters and their sources.'</p>
              <p>Response: This section was excessively wordy in places, so has now been simplified with some paragraphs removed entirely.</p>
              <p>8. `The results are very interesting but are spread in text and should be synthesized in a table, with the results of the proposed model and the SEIR model side by side, together with a statistical significance test of the difference between them.'</p>
              <p>Response: We have addressed this comment with Tables 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Table 8 puts the results of the two models side by side, together with a statistical significance test of the difference between them, as requested.</p>
              <p>Having made these revisions, carefully addressing each of the helpful comments raised in the review, we feel that the quality of our manuscript has been substantially improved and present the revised version for your consideration.</p>
              <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Some further comments following the authors' responses:</p>
              <p>1/ Regarding the vaccination efficacy, the authors only consider the all-or-nothing scenario that appears not to be the case for COVID-19 vaccines. Expermiments that consider the efficacy in terms of both infection and transmission would be more useful.</p>
              <p>2/ I found the justification on the appropriateness of agent-based models compared with other types of stochastic compartment models still not persuasive. If the intention of the model is to compare the relative effectiveness between interventions and the authors predict that the conclusions are not highly sensitive to parameter changes, how would adding more heterogeneities into the model would result in significant differences in output. Also, if a sophisicated analysis is out of reach due to the long runtime of the model, adding more heterogeneties means adding more uncertainty into the model without being able to manage such uncertainty. This soulds like a disadvangtage of ABM.</p>

              <p>1. `Regarding the vaccination efficacy, the authors only consider the all-or-nothing scenario that appears not to be the case for COVID-19 vaccines. Experiments that consider the efficacy in terms of both infection and transmission would be more useful.'</p>
              <p>Response: Our model of vaccination, despite taking into account such factors as vaccine hesitancy, limits on daily doses, a delay between first and second doses, and the order in which individuals are vaccinated, does indeed implement vaccine efficacy in a relatively simple way. Immune responses are in reality very diverse and complex, and vary significantly between individuals, with some individuals being unable to mount an immune response at all. We therefore agree that it would be extremely useful to develop a more detailed model of immunity, and implement it in the simulations. For this reason, we are currently working on a project that aims to do just that, using a model that distinguishes immunity to infection from immunity to transmission, as suggested by the reviewer, and also immunity against symptomatic illness or severe disease. This new project also considers factors such as partial immunity, waning immunity, cross immunity for multiple variants and multiple vaccines. We feel that a deeper exploration of the topic of COVID-19 vaccination and immunity requires its own project, with many of the aforementioned factors being beyond the scope of the submitted manuscript. The all-or-nothing scenario is assumed for simplicity, with this assumption often being found in the literature. We have nonetheless revised the conclusion to our manuscript to emphasise, in response to the reviewer's comment, that the all-or-nothing approach is a limitation of the study.</p>
              <p>2. `I found the justification on the appropriateness of agent-based models compared with other types of stochastic compartment models still not persuasive. If the intention of the model is to compare the relative effectiveness between interventions and the authors predict that the conclusions are not highly sensitive to parameter changes, how would adding more heterogeneities into the model would result in significant differences in output. Also, if a sophisticated analysis is out of reach due to the long runtime of the model, adding more heterogeneities means adding more uncertainty into the model without being able to manage such uncertainty. This sounds like a disadvantage of ABM.'</p>
              <p>Response: While it is true that stochastic compartmental models have some advantages, agent-based models reflect the fact that epidemics do in fact result from the actions and interactions of individuals, offering a natural 'bottom-up' methodology to complement the 'top-down' methodology of the equation-based compartmental models.</p>
              <p>Our model features heterogeneous behaviour and age, since these are clearly important factors in determining the outcome of a COVID-19 epidemic, but on the other hand does not distinguish agents by sex or by the presence of underlying medical conditions, and keeps sub-models of public transport and leisure relatively simple. Overall, our aim was to find a reasonable balance between detail and flexibility.</p>
              <p>An agent-based model need not have more parameter uncertainty than a compartmental model, since many of the features that require parametrizing in a compartmental model, for example the flows of population between locations, are emergent in the agent-based model, consequences of the rules imposed on agents rather than the values assigned to certain variables. In an agent-based model, these rules are often intuitive, allowing for realistic representations of policy interventions. For example, in the agent-based model, lockdowns simply direct agents to stay at home (unless they are exempt), while in a compartmental model, a lockdown is represented more abstractly as a reduction in `beta', the contact rate multiplied by the transmission probability. This reduction in `beta' then requires its own estimate, a step not required in the agent-based model. Agent-based models, when implemented efficiently, can actually reduce uncertainty when compared to a heavily parametrized compartmental model.</p>
              <p>Moreover, if it turns out that certain additional heterogeneities really do not have a big impact on the outcome, then this is in itself an interesting result, that might be difficult to obtain using a stochastic compartmental model.</p>
              <p>We should point out that, in the case of our model, the limiting factor is not so much the complexity of the model, but rather the fact that it is written in Python, which executes relatively slowly. For this reason, we are currently working on performance enhancements that will reduce the runtime from several hours to several minutes, ultimately allowing for a more sophisticated statistical analysis of uncertainty. This is, however, still a work in progress.</p>
              <p>We have revised our manuscript to include further discussion of the limitations of the modelling approach, and how we intend to address them in the future.</p>
