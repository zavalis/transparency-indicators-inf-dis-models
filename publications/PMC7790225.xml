              <abstract>
                <p>The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is an emergent disease that initially had no historical data to guide scientists on predicting/ forecasting its global or national impact over time. The ability to predict the progress of this pandemic has been crucial for decision making aimed at fighting this pandemic and controlling its spread. In this work we considered four different statistical/time series models that are readily available from the ‘forecast’ package in R. We performed novel applications with these models, forecasting the number of infected cases (confirmed cases and similarly the number of deaths and recovery) along with the corresponding 90% prediction interval to estimate uncertainty around pointwise forecasts. Since the future may not repeat the past for this pandemic, no prediction model is certain. However, any prediction tool with acceptable prediction performance (or prediction error) could still be very useful for public-health planning to handle spread of the pandemic, and could policy decision-making and facilitate transition to normality. These four models were applied to publicly available data of the COVID-19 pandemic for both the USA and Italy. We observed that all models reasonably predicted the future numbers of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of COVID-19. However, for the majority of the analyses, the time series model with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and cubic smoothing spline models both had smaller prediction errors and narrower prediction intervals, compared to the Holt and Trigonometric Exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation (TBATS) models. Therefore, the former two models were preferable to the latter models. Given similarities in performance of the models in the USA and Italy, the corresponding prediction tools can be applied to other countries grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, and to any pandemics that can occur in future.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Cases of severe respiratory illness began to be reported across the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019. These were caused by a new type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, alternatively known as COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0244173.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The number of COVID-19 cases quickly escalated in mid-January, and the virus soon spread beyond China's borders. As of this study, it has reached 188 countries worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0244173.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite broadening COVID-19 impacts, there remain key public health questions. How many people will be infected? How does the situation change day by day? Can we predict/forecast the future numbers of people infected with COVID-19 by using daily updated data on the pandemic’s trajectory? These questions could be answered by forecasting the possible futures of this pandemic through statistical/time series models. However, widely used time series models and tools do not necessarily have high forecasting/prediction accuracy, especially for medical studies [<xref rid="pone.0244173.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves and additional data are amassed [<xref rid="pone.0244173.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], new insights emerge on the reasonableness of the prediction models developed and tested; however, predicting its future requires transparent reporting and multiple model assessments [<xref rid="pone.0244173.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite these ongoing challenges, forecasting is still critical to better understand the current situation and progression of COVID-19, to prepare for the future of this ongoing pandemic. Using appropriate models and making accurate projections consistently may enhance public health decision-making; for example, intervention-induced changes in the spread of disease [<xref rid="pone.0244173.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this paper, we provide statistical forecasts for the confirmed cases of COVID-19 using four different, highly cited time series models, which we subsequently introduce, and compare their performance to analyze the trajectory of cases.</p>
              <p>In this work, we propose examining the utility of these models for forecasting the number of new COVID-19 cases in select countries based on the daily reported data. By empirically comparing multiple models in terms of their forecasting accuracy, we intend to suggest an appropriate model, which can be readily used by society, organizations, or governments to assess near futures of this outbreak. We acknowledge that this is a difficult forecasting problem, since this pandemic continues and there are many factors that we cannot presently control. Our prediction accuracy will improve with time and more data. An appealing part of these models that we considered is that they are already implemented in an accessible R package and can be applied readily by analysts. Fitting each model only takes several seconds, and the models are conducive to daily updating as newly available data are accrued. Daily updating of these models is suggested, because the accuracy of the forecasting depends on the available data used for model development, producing predictions, and generating prediction intervals (PIs) [<xref rid="pone.0244173.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>

              <title>Materials and methods</title>
              <p>We considered four time series models for our case study. The first model was the Holt model [<xref rid="pone.0244173.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244173.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which employs double exponential smoothing; two smoothing components adjust for level and trend in the data. The second model was the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, which theory dictates is the most general class of models for forecasting a time series. Although the ARIMA model is useful and powerful in time series analysis, it is somewhat difficult to choose appropriate orders for its components. For our purposes aimed at utility, it was necessary to determine the orders automatically; thus, we used the ‘auto.arima’ function from the forecast package in R, which returns the best ARIMA model according to model fit statistics by searching over possible models within the order constraints provided. Third was the TBATS (Trigonometric Exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal component) model [<xref rid="pone.0244173.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which uses a combination of Fourier terms with an exponential smoothing state space model and a Box-Cox transformation, in a completely automated manner. The last model considered was the cubic smoothing spline model based on a stochastic state space model that allows the use of a likelihood approach for estimating the smoothing parameter, thereby facilitating construction of the PI. It has been shown that this model is a special case of an ARIMA(0, 2, 2) model [<xref rid="pone.0244173.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Its advantage over the full ARIMA model is that it provides a smooth historical trend as well as a linear forecast function. An overview of the models is provided as S1 Table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244173.s001">S1 File</xref>, along with specific equations.</p>
              <p>The main outcomes of interest were the daily collected numbers of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. We downloaded the data from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19</ext-link> accessed on 04/28/2020), which consists of daily cumulative cases and covered our analysis period from February 22, 2020 until April 29, 2020. The unit of time used in modeling was day. Each outcome, beginning between March and April, exhibited a nearly exponential increase over time for both the USA and Italy (see S1 Fig in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244173.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p>
              <p>The forecasting performance of all these models were evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Additionally, the model fits were evaluated by using AIC (Akaike information criteria), reported in <xref rid="pone.0244173.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We examined forecast durations in a weekly fashion, to assess model performance as extent of data collection increased over calendar time. All the aforementioned models are already implemented and available in the ‘forecast’ package in R, which makes implementation straightforward and possible in freely available software. The computer code that we used for our analyses is provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244173.s001">S1 File</xref>.</p>

              <p>We performed the forecasting analysis for confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, and number of recoveries for the USA and Italy by using the models discussed above. For both countries, we conducted 7-day- or one-week ahead point forecasts and PIs. We updated our forecasts every 7 days under each of the four models considered. The results of our analyses for both countries are summarized with figures provided below. The accuracy metrics and fit statistics for each forecasting period, outcome, model and country are provided in <xref rid="pone.0244173.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
              <p>Firstly, we considered applying these models to forecast the number of confirmed cases for the USA. The observed and forecasted confirmed COVID-19 cases in the USA with 90% PIs for each forecasting period and model are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244173.g001">Fig 1</xref>.</p>

              <p>The first forecast period covered April 2- April 8, 2020 where we used the data collected during the previous days. The forecasts and 90% PIs produced at the end of April 1 are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244173.g001">Fig 1</xref>. For the four models, the mean estimates and accompanying 90% PI for the confirmed cases 7-days ahead, expressed in rounded form in terms of thousands, were 389 (356, 422) for ARIMA, 484 (354, 644) for TBATS, 386 (347, 424) for Spline, and 389 (356, 423) for Holt. The actual number of confirmed cases was 428654 (rounded to 429 in terms of thousands) on April 8, which was captured by only the 90% prediction interval of TBATS model; this model had the lowest MAE and MAPE for this specific forecasting period (see <xref rid="pone.0244173.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In this period predictions were less accurate than expected, possibly due to limited available data till April 1.</p>
              <p>For the second forecast period, we incorporated another week of historical data by including the number of cases observed until April 8, 2020. This time the forecast period covered April 9- April 15, 2020. We again used the same models to conduct 7-day ahead predictions. The forecasts and 90% PIs produced at the end of April 7 are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244173.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The mean estimate (PI) for the confirmed cases 7-days ahead was 649 (611, 687), 701 (565, 857), 650 (616, 683), and 650 (613, 686) for the models ARIMA, TBATS, Spline, and Holt, respectively. The actual number of confirmed cases on April 14 was 636350 (rounded to 636 in terms of thousands), which was included by the 90% prediction intervals of all four models. Among all models, the Spline model had the lowest MAPE 8.1%, followed by the ARIMA model with MAPE 8.7% (see <xref rid="pone.0244173.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
              <p>Furthermore, we conducted another set of forecasts and PIs for Period III which includes April 16-April 22, 2020. Similar to the analyses presented above, we used the data up until April 15, 2020. The mean estimate (PI) for 7-days ahead was 837 (797, 876), 854 (721, 1003), 834 (801, 868), and 837 (798, 876) for the models ARIMA, TBATS, Spline, and Holt, respectively. The actual number of confirmed cases on April 22 was 840351 (rounded to 840 in terms of thousands), which was well inside the prediction bands of all four models (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244173.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Among these models, the Spline model had the lowest MAPE which is 7.1%, but overall each method had quite small MAPE (see <xref rid="pone.0244173.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
              <p>In the forecasting period IV, we considered forecasting for April 23- April 29, 2020 by using the data up until April 22, 2020. The mean estimate (PI) for 7-days ahead was 1040 (999, 1081), 1052 (929, 1183), 1041 (999, 1082), and 1040 (998, 1081) for the models ARIMA, TBATS, Spline, and Holt, respectively. The actual number of confirmed cases on April 29 was 1039909 (rounded to 1040 in terms of thousands) which is aligned with the predicted values by all models and included by their 90% PI. All the models had very low MAPE, slightly differing from each other, especially the Spline and ARIMA models which had MAPE&lt; 7% (see <xref rid="pone.0244173.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
              <p>In the final step, we used entire data history up till April 29, 2020, and we attempted forecasting for period V covering April 30 to May 06, 2020. Predicted confirmed cases and corresponding PIs for all models are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244173.g001">Fig 1</xref>. For this period, the point forecast (PI) for 7-days ahead was 1231 (1184, 1279), 1232 (1111, 1360), 1232 (1185, 1279), and 1231 (1183, 1279) for the models ARIMA, TBATS, Spline, and Holt, respectively. The data on April 29, 2020, were used to provide point forecasts and prediction intervals for the period V (April 30- May 06, 2020). At the time we performed our study, this period had not occurred; thus, we did not have the actual numbers of confirmed cases up to the concluding point of our analyses. The point forecasts and prediction intervals are provided in S2 Table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244173.s001">S1 File</xref>. As more data becomes available and is incorporated in the forecasting analysis, the model’s predictive accuracies (e.g., MAPE) improved (see <xref rid="pone.0244173.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For this period, the MAPE values are 6.1%, 8.4%, 6%, and 6.9% for ARIMA, TBATS, Spline, and Holt, respectively.</p>
              <p>Similarly, we applied these models to forecast the confirmed cases for Italy for the same forecasting periods, and the results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244173.g002">Fig 2</xref>. Based on our analyses, we concluded that the prediction performance of all these models were similar to what we observed in the USA data application. The values of actual observed confirmed cases were contained inside the prediction bands of all four models for all five forecasting periods. In particular, the models ARIMA, Spline and TBATS had quite small MAPE and good prediction accuracies (see <xref rid="pone.0244173.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The TBATS model had a wider PI for the first four forecasting periods but behaved similar to the PIs of the other three models for period V (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244173.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Additionally, the point forecasts and prediction intervals for the period V are provided in S3 Table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244173.s001">S1 File</xref>. We observed decreased in the forecasting accuracy metrics of all four models, compared to the previous period in both applications, which is expected as more data becomes available from forecasting periods I to V.</p>

              <p>We next applied the same models to forecast the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the USA for the aforementioned forecasting periods, although these models did not account for all factors that affect mortality of patients infected with COVID-19. The point forecast and PIs that we produced are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244173.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Again, for this application, the prediction performance of all these models was similar, and the values of actual observed number of deaths were within the PI bands of all four models for at least part of the forecasting periods. The ARIMA and Spline models had smaller prediction errors, compared to the other two models. The forecasting accuracy metrics and AIC values for this application are also provided in <xref rid="pone.0244173.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Overall, the observed number of deaths were included by the PIs from these models except the predictions for forecasting periods I and III (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244173.g003">Fig 3</xref>).

              <p>We now considered forecasting for the number of recoveries from COVID-19 in the USA by applying the same set of models. We obtained the point forecasts and prediction intervals for different forecast period that are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244173.g005">Fig 5</xref>. The MAE, MAPE, and AIC values of this analysis are provided in <xref rid="pone.0244173.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The prediction performance of ARIMA, Splines, and Holt models were much better than the performance of the TBATS model, which yielded much higher prediction errors and quite wide PIs, especially for the first three forecasting periods in this application (for these periods the prediction intervals of TBATS model are trimmed to have better visualization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244173.g005">Fig 5</xref>). However, the performance of the TBATS model improved as more data became available. The PIs from the other three models did not contain the observed number of recoveries for forecast period IV: likely due to an unexpected jump/change in the trajectory of the number of recoveries in the USA. The forecasting accuracy metrics for this application are summarized in <xref rid="pone.0244173.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

Point forecasts and PIs for the aforementioned forecast periods are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244173.g006">Fig 6</xref>. For this application, we found that the prediction performance of ARIMA and Holt models were slightly better than the performance of the Spline and TBATS models.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We have evaluated four different highly cited time series models for forecasting confirmed cases, number of deaths and number of recoveries of COVID-19 for both the USA and Italy. Our application demonstrated the similarities in performance across countries for key COVID-19 outcomes but also elucidated where predictive performance may be lacking in certain models based on data accrual and sudden, sharp changes in trajectory. Although past publications have largely focused on the forecasting the number of the confirmed cases, we extended our study by considering number of deaths and recoveries. We focused on the data for two countries; however, we illustrated how our approach can be applied to data arising from any country or worldwide data. Similarly, the models considered in our work can be implemented on new data as it becomes available. The forecasting analyses should be updated as the data accumulate periodically to increase accuracy of forecasting, since this is an ongoing pandemic and additional data would improve forecasting performance of these models.</p>
              <p>Using multiple models enabled us to test and compare their prediction accuracy and make an optimal selection. Our study showed how selecting a COVID-19 prediction model among existing, powerful options for time series models can readily assist in decision-making through projections regarding important issues such as intervention-induced changes in the spread of disease or making plans for controlling the pandemic and returning to normal life [<xref rid="pone.0244173.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Such models could be useful in instances where knowledge is limited regarding the progress of the pandemic in a country or the world; assumptions about the future of this emergent disease (COVID-19 pandemic) can be made based on these established models and their available implementations on an open-source platform. Although we considered a breadth of models and outcomes, our work did not account for individualized factors that affect death and recovery. Incorporating such factors is expected to improve accuracy and narrow the width of PIs. Subject-level data applications are needed to address this issue. We should note that these approaches can produce forecasts for longer time periods, such as several weeks or months ahead. We examined forecast durations in a weekly fashion in this work given the nature of the forecasting goal to assess immediate windows of time.</p>
              <p>Our study showed that all models resulted in similar overarching conclusions, provided there exists a reasonable amount of historical data available; however, each model exhibited subtle differences. The ARIMA model was the most consistent model across our different applications and could be preferable over the other models if one must pick a single model for application. ARIMA and cubic smoothing spline models had smaller prediction error and narrower PIs, compared to the Holt and TBATS models in the majority of the analyses. This is a surprising finding for the spline models, as this approach tends to perform worse in extrapolation settings. Indeed, these models were not robust in all settings. The TBATS model had quite large widths on the PIs especially when a limited amount of data was available, which is not preferable in applications with constant data accrual. Wider intervals correspond to a higher degree of uncertainty for the point forecasts. On the other hand, the Holt model always had a substantially larger AIC, which indicates poorer model fit, compared to the others for both the USA and Italy applications. TBATS and Spline models mostly resulted in similar AIC values and were often slightly smaller than the AIC of the ARIMA model (the smaller AIC, the better model fit) in the analysis for the USA data. The ARIMA model had the smallest AIC in all forecast periods for the Italy application. However, the model that has better fit (smaller AIC) does not always have a better prediction performance. One should judiciously select a model that has smaller prediction error while better reflecting the nature of the data. The forecasting accuracy metrics of all four models mostly improved with the increased amount of available data as days pass during this pandemic in both the USA and Italy. The unstable patterns in historical data on the number of deaths are more likely to worsen the accuracy of forecasts, but for the future forecasts these models are capable of accounting for major changes in the historical trajectory. In conclusion, these readily available models that can be performed efficiently at any time for any country or worldwide have reasonable accuracy for short-term forecasting of this pandemic, which should not be ignored.</p>
