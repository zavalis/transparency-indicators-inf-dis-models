              <abstract>
                <p>Australia, home to the iconic dingo, is currently free from canine rabies. However northern Australia, including Indigenous communities with large free-roaming domestic dog populations, is at increased risk of rabies incursion from nearby Indonesia. We developed a novel agent-based stochastic spatial rabies spread model to evaluate the potential spread of rabies within the dingo population of the Northern Peninsula Area (NPA) region of northern Australia. The model incorporated spatio-temporal features specific to this host-environment system, including landscape heterogeneity, demographic fluctuations, dispersal movements and dingo ecological parameters—such as home range size and density—derived from NPA field studies. Rabies spread between dingo packs in nearly 60% of simulations. In such situations rabies would affect a median of 22 dingoes (approximately 14% of the population; 2.5–97.5 percentiles: 2–101 dingoes) within the study area which covered 1,131 km<sup>2</sup>, and spread 0.52 km/week for 191 days. Larger outbreaks occurred in scenarios in which an incursion was introduced during the dry season (vs. wet season), and close to communities (vs. areas with high risk of interaction between dingoes and hunting community dogs). Sensitivity analyses revealed that home range size and duration of infectious clinical period contributed most to the variance of outputs. Although conditions in the NPA would most likely not support a sustained propagation of the disease in the dingo population, due to the predicted number of infected dingoes following a rabies incursion and the proximity of Indigenous communities to dingo habitat, we conclude that the risk for human transmission could be substantial.</p>

                <p>Although Australia is free from canine rabies, an incursion from nearby rabies-infected Indonesian islands is a realistic threat. The ubiquitous presence of dingoes in the wild, in association with large populations of free-roaming domestic dogs from northern Australian Indigenous communities, increases the risk of a rabies outbreak. Using a newly developed simulation model, we investigated the potential spread of rabies in a northern Australian dingo population. Nearly 60% of model simulations resulted in more than one pack infected. When spread did occur, outbreaks affected a median of 22 dingoes (an estimated 14% of the population in this area). The duration of infection, proportion of the population infected and spatial spread of the outbreak was greatest when rabies was introduced during the dry season and close to communities. Our results demonstrate that an incursion of rabies into the northern Australian dingo population would likely lead to a rabies outbreak, which would in turn pose a substantial threat to Indigenous communities in northern Australia.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Canine rabies is a vaccine-preventable viral disease, estimated to cause 59 000 human deaths annually, mostly occurring in Asia and Africa [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although domestic dogs account for most canine rabies transmissions to humans [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], rabies can be maintained within a wildlife-mediated cycle involving wild canidae populations [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A feature of rabies is the behavioral change observed in clinically affected hosts, which can be classified as dumb (paralytic) and furious (hyperactive) forms. Behavior associated in animals affected with the dumb form includes restricted movement (for example, remaining confined to a den) whereas animals affected by the furious form might display signs of increased agitation leading them to roam considerable distances, as observed in rabies-infected foxes [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These rabies-induced behaviors most likely have an impact on contact patterns between individuals and hence disease dynamics [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although Australia is historically free from canine rabies, northern Australia faces an increased risk of canine rabies introduction due to the recent eastern spread of the disease through the Indonesian archipelago, with outbreaks occurring in previously rabies-free Indonesian islands such as Flores, Ambon, Sumbawa and Bali [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The illegal boat transportation of a latent rabies infected domestic dog from Indonesia into a community in northern Australia is considered to be the most likely route of entry of rabies [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], similar to the introduction of rabies in Bali [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The northern Australian coast is particularly vulnerable to the establishment of rabies: this sparsely populated area contains socio-economically disadvantaged remote Indigenous communities with cultural practices that include free-roaming domestic dogs [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; in addition, there is limited access to healthcare and veterinary care services [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>The Australian wild dog population, composed of dingoes, feral domestic dogs and dingo-dog hybrids (collectively referred to as ‘dingo’ hereafter), is widespread across mainland Australia, inhabiting a large variety of habitat types and climate zones, including equatorial northern Australia [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Considering a rabies incursion in the Indigenous communities of northern Australia, the subsequent spillover of the disease from domestic dogs to dingoes is a plausible scenario, because there is evidence of opportunities for interactions between both populations [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For instance, in a camera-trap study conducted in the Northern Peninsula Area (NPA) of Queensland, a substantial temporal overlap of daily activity patterns was found between dingoes and free-roaming domestic dogs [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, hunting expeditions with domestic dogs from northern Australian Indigenous communities create contact opportunities between hunting dogs and dingoes, increasing the risk of disease transmission at the wild-domestic interface in areas far away from the communities [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>Infectious disease spread models play an important role in providing insight to inform decision-making and therefore efficiently control disease spread [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our understanding of rabies transmission dynamics in wild animal populations, including foxes (<italic>Vulpes vulpes</italic>) [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and raccoons (<italic>Procyon lotor</italic>) [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], has been improved by disease spread models. In Australia, the spread of rabies has been modelled in domestic dog populations from different environmental settings, including Indigenous communities in equatorial northern Australia [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Rabies spread was simulated within and between populations of dingoes and free-roaming domestic dogs of the mid-eastern coast of Australia using a simple stochastic state-transition model [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Only one model (a stochastic spatial transmission network model) has been developed to evaluate the spread of canine rabies within the dingo population in northern Australia [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this model, dingo density was an influential parameter in determining whether a canine rabies epidemic would occur. However, model parameters were based on limited population data which was not specific to this region. Since this model, a recent camera-trap study conducted in equatorial northern Australia has generated spatio-temporal ecological data for the northern Australian dingo population [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], including dingo movement and density estimates, which are fundamental drivers for wildlife disease spread [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
              <p>The objective of this study was to evaluate potential rabies spread within dingoes in the NPA—using parameters relevant to the northern Australian dingo context—as the first step in assessing the potential impact of a rabies incursion into the dingo population on the risk to human populations. We aimed to estimate the probability of rabies spreading between packs and, in such an event, the magnitude (in terms of duration, proportion of packs infected and number of dingoes infected) and spatial spread of rabies, considering the geographical and seasonal characteristics of the area and the ecology of the dingo population. In addition, we explored the impact of the location and season of incursion on the predicted outbreak and used global sensitivity analysis to evaluate which input parameters contribute most to variance of the model outcomes.</p>

Five remote Indigenous communities are located within the NPA (Bamaga, Seisia, New Mapoon, Injinoo and Umagico), ranging from 260 [Seisia] to 1164 [Bamaga] residents [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and contain a relatively large population of free-roaming domestic dogs (542 estimated roaming dogs [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). Two contrasting seasons occur in this equatorial climate zone [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; a dry season (May to October) characterised by little rainfall throughout the area (mean monthly precipitation varying between 7mm and 60mm for the period 1960–2020), and a wet season (November to April) with high levels of humidity and heavy rainfall (mean monthly precipitation varying between 50mm and 430mm for the period 1960–2020; [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). Vegetation types include rainforest, open heath, eucalypt woodland, mangroves and wetlands [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Based on the Map Grid of Australia 1984 Transverse Mercator projection system, zone 54, the study area was bound to the south by the northing coordinate 8,770,000 m and on the east side by easting coordinate 662,000 m to ensure it matched the dingo population sampled, and the corresponding ecological parameters that were obtained in our previous field study [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>

                <title>Model structure</title>
                <p>An agent-based spatial model was implemented in Python version 3.7 [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] to simulate rabies transmission within the dingo population on a daily time step. The maximum duration for each simulation was 3 years. A simulation was defined as the execution of the model, including the creation of a new dingo population and, subsequently, rabies transmission within the population. The dingo population size in a simulation fluctuated over time throughout a given year, according to natural death and birth in the population. The centroid points of all dingo packs were randomly distributed across the study area. All members of a pack shared a common home range center; however, each dingo’s home range distribution varied independently from other dingoes in the same pack. This home range distribution represented the probability of finding a dingo around its centroid point, which was described by a bivariate Normal distribution. Dingoes could relocate to a newly vacant home range area at each time-step, according to a daily probability of relocation. Seasonal variations in terms of density and home range size were integrated into the model, based on results previously found in our field study [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Since young puppies are confined to the den for the first few months of life, their role in disease transmission would most likely remain negligible and, therefore, dingoes younger than 4–6 months of age were not included in the dingo population of the model.</p>
                <p>Disease transmission was initiated by selecting one dingo to be the first latently infected individual (primary case), which was assumed to have contracted rabies from a domestic dog. The initiation of infection could occur at different times in the year and at different locations throughout the study area. Rabies infection in individual dingoes followed five stages: Susceptible (S)–Latent (E)–Infectious Pre-clinical (I<sub>1</sub>)–Infectious Clinical (I<sub>2</sub>)–Dead (R). The infection was assumed to be 100% fatal. When a dingo was infectious (I<sub>1</sub> or I<sub>2</sub>), the daily probability of contact between this dingo and all other susceptible dingoes in the population was calculated at each time-step based on the spatial overlap of home range distributions. Transmission of rabies was dependent on the probability of bite by the infectious dingo given contact between the pair of dingoes and the probability of successful rabies transmission to the susceptible dingo, given a bite. A dingo in the infectious clinical stage (I<sub>2</sub>) exhibited either the furious or dumb form, which increased or decreased the probability of bite and the standard deviation of the home range distribution, respectively.</p>

                  <title>Spatial allocation of packs and pack size fluctuations</title>
                  <p>A polygon shapefile was created in ArcGIS version 10.5 (ESRI, Redlands, CA), delimiting the boundaries of our study area (see section <italic>Study area</italic>) [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A dataset of 31,976 points (referred to as ‘entire grid points’ hereafter), each point separated by a distance of 200 meters forming a rectangular grid, was built in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and overlaid within the land covered by the shapefile. To define the area in which home range centroid points of packs could occur, all points located within unsuitable habitat types for dingoes’ long-term survival—including mangroves, watercourse areas [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], marine swamps, saline coastal flats, swamps, lakes, foreshore flats [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and ocean—were removed. Additionally, to ensure that all dingoes had most of their home range areas inland, points within a distance of 1.4 km from the ocean coast (i.e. corresponding to the lowest value of our range of home range radii sampled in our model) were removed from the dataset. This resulted in a total of 24,804 points representing the potential location of home range centroids of packs (referred to as ‘potential pack points’ hereafter).</p>
                  <p>At the start of a simulation, for each pack of dingoes, one point was randomly selected among all ‘potential pack points’, located at least 1.4 km from all points that were previously assigned to packs, to represent the location of the pack’s home range centroid point. This minimum distance condition between packs reduced biologically implausible clustering across the study area, and is consistent with a study of a population of dingoes in Western Australia with density estimates similar to our target population (0.05 and 0.22 dingoes/km<sup>2</sup>; [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) which found that spatial overlap of dingo territories is limited.</p>
                  <p>It is important to note that the location of packs remained fixed throughout a simulation and the total number of packs at any given time during a simulation could not exceed the initial number of packs. That is, the seasonal population size fluctuations within each simulation were solely related to variation in the number of dingoes within each pack location. This is consistent with Thomson et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] who observed an increase in density in a dingo population due to an increase in pack size rather than pack numbers. The home range centroid point of a pack could become ‘empty’ during a simulation due to relocation of dingoes outside the pack or death of members, but could then repopulate following relocation of a single dingo into the vacant area or introduction of new independent dingoes in that area. Each new young independent dingo introduced into the model was assigned to a pack randomly, regardless of pack size (empty to large).</p>

                  <title>Movement network</title>
                  <p>The distance between the centroid points of each pair of packs is required to calculate the probability of a dingo relocating to a new area and the probability of two dingoes being in contact (See following sections <italic>Probability of relocation</italic> and <italic>Probability of contact</italic>), and were pre-calculated for each season for use in simulations. Using the ‘entire grid points’, a network of lines was created by connecting each point to its 32 nearest neighboring points in all directions (i.e. the largest number of connections which reflected an optimal balance between computational time and sufficient representation of the actual shortest distance between each pair of points). These connections represented the edges in which dingoes were allowed to travel from one point to another within the resulting network (See Fig E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0009124.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). The portion of the lines overlapping unsuitable habitats for dingoes’ movements during the dry and wet seasons were removed from the network, resulting in a Network dataset for each season. Dingoes were therefore not allowed to cross these unsuitable habitats, but rather circumvent these obstacles, resulting in a larger distance between points. Unsuitable habitat types for dingoes’ movements during the wet season included only swamps, lakes, foreshore flats, watercourse areas and ocean, assuming that dingoes may travel across all other habitat types. For the dry season, swamps were considered as a suitable habitat type for movement, as this wetland type would often dry-out during the dry season in the study area. The shortest path between each pair of the ‘potential pack points’ was found for each seasonal network dataset, by allowing the path to go through any connecting vertices or any point of line intersection, using the Network Analyst extension functions of ArcGIS. This resulted in two pre-calculated distance matrices (i.e. dry and wet seasons) between all pairs of ‘potential pack points’.</p>

                  <p>When integrated over a defined space (for example, a circle of radius <italic>R</italic> from the centroid point), we obtain the probability of finding the dingo within that area. Integrating over the entire space results in a probability equal to one (i.e. there is 100% chance of finding the dingo somewhere). According to our field study [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the home range sizes of dingoes in the NPA vary between half-seasons. Therefore, each dingo was assigned four randomly selected 95% home range size values (one for each half-season). We assumed that each dingo’s home range size corresponded to the area in which there is a 95% probability of finding the dingo. That is, the dingo is found 95% of the time within a circle of radius <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>95</italic></sub> equal to the size of its home range and ventures outside of its home range only 5% of the time. Using this assumption, the standard deviation (<italic>σ</italic>) can be calculated as a proportion of <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>95</italic></sub> (<italic>0</italic>.<italic>4*R</italic><sub><italic>95</italic></sub>; details of calculations found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0009124.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>).

                  <p>Dispersal has been described as the action of a dingo relocating permanently beyond the boundaries of its usually occupied area and occurs more readily when areas become vacant [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Within the model, home range centroids could become vacant following natural death, death due to rabies, or relocation of all members of the pack and could be recolonized by the dispersal of one single individual from another pack into the vacant area. Relocation of a dingo to a vacant area occurred when the following criteria were met: 1) a vacant home range centroid was located beyond the 95% home range area of the dingo, in accordance with the definition of dispersal and 2) the dingo found itself within an area of approximately 4 km<sup>2</sup> around the location of the empty home range centroid. The probability of dingo <italic>i</italic> (with its standard deviation <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) relocating at a new centroid point of distance <italic>d</italic> is therefore equal to the probability that the dingo finds itself in the vicinity of the vacated point, if this point is located beyond the 95% home range area of the dingo.

The daily probability of relocation is therefore also expected to decrease with the number of home range days, in accordance with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pntd.0009124.e003">Eq 3</xref>.</p>

                      <p>A) Influence of the home range size and number of home range days on the daily probability of contact between a pair of non-clinical dingoes of different packs. For illustrative purposes, the two dingoes in each pair (i.e. each curve) occupy home range areas of equal size, either small (most likely value from the second half of the wet season) or large (most likely value from the second half of the dry season). B) Influence of rabies-induced home range size changes on the probability of contact between a pair of dingoes of different packs. In this example, the healthy dingoes (grey curve) both have a standard deviation, <italic>σ</italic>, equal to 1.0 km, with an average number of home range days, <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, equal to 3. The pink and blue curves represent the revised probability of contact if one of the individuals becomes clinically infectious with the furious and dumb forms, respectively, applying the maximum and minimum inflation factors on standard deviations (i.e. factor of 2 and 0.5, respectively), with the number of home range days unchanged.</p>

                  <title>Pack size</title>
                  <p>We sampled pack sizes from a plausible range of values following a PERT distribution, spanning from 1 to 7 members per pack. The minimal value is consistent with previous reports of lone dingoes in various environmental settings [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The maximal value was based on a mid-range value between 1) the maximum dingo group size observed from camera-traps in the NPA (5 members, [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]), which most likely represents an underestimation of the maximum pack size since members of a pack are not always together at all times and are often found travelling and hunting in sub-groups [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and 2) estimations of dingo pack sizes of up to 9 members on Fraser Island [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The latter estimate most likely is an overestimation of the maximum pack size in our study area because the Fraser Island population benefits from a resourceful and carefully managed environment. To reflect the seasonal fluctuation of pack sizes due to death or introduction of new young independent dingoes into the group, the assigned PERT distribution mode value was defined within the middle of the range, varying between 3.2 to 4.6 members according to the time at which the primary rabies case occurred (beginning of dry season = 4.1; halfway through the dry season = 3.6; beginning of wet season = 3.2; halfway through the wet season = 4.6). These values were chosen because they generate, on average, a similar number of packs regardless of the season in which the simulation started.</p>

                  <title>Number of days to cover the home range area</title>
                  <p>No information was found in the literature that indicated the number of days needed for a dingo to cover its home range area or the area covered by a dingo per day. Nevertheless, since the home range sizes reported for the NPA dingo population were relatively small (6.4–33.8 km<sup>2</sup>) and dingoes with similar home range sizes have been found to travel long distances per day (10–20 km/day [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]), we assumed that the proportion of home range area traversed by a NPA dingo each day would vary between 20% to 66%, which corresponds to a 1.5 to 5 day period for entire home range coverage. Since it could be expected that a dingo would increase its level of roaming activity in the dry season, either by increasing its speed or the time dedicated for roaming due to a lack of resources and water availability, the number of home range days remained constant in the model for each dingo during all seasons, regardless of the higher home range sizes during the dry season.</p>

                  <title>Variation in home range size and number of home range days due to rabies-induced behavioural changes</title>
                  <p>Behavioural changes in a rabies-infected dingo might alter the distance the individual roams and the area of land covered per day. To include these rabies-induced behavioural changes into the model, the standard deviation of each infectious dingo’s home range distribution was increased in the case of the furious form and decreased in the case of the dumb form, whilst the number of home range days remained constant. Considering the lack of information in the literature, we assumed that a dingo with the furious or dumb form of rabies would have the radius of its 95% home range area (and hence its standard deviation) increased or decreased by a factor of up to 2, respectively (referred to as “Home range inflation constant”). With these behavioural changes, and considering the ranges of dingo home range sizes in each season, the probability of contact between a clinically infected dingo and a normal dingo would always decrease in the case of the dumb form and, for large distances, increase in the case of the furious form, as illustrated in the example of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009124.g002">Fig 2B</xref>.</p>

Given the available data in the literature, 3 days was selected as the PERT distribution mode for the infectious clinical period and 0 and 12 days were defined as the minimum and maximum values, respectively; this distribution generates median and mean values of 3.7 and 4.0, respectively, consistent with previous studies.</p>

                  <title>Probability of bite and probability of successful transmission</title>
                  <p>We assumed that the biting behavior of a dingo infected during the pre-clinical stage (without any clinical signs) or a dingo infected with the dumb form of rabies during the clinical stage would be equivalent to a healthy dingo in a typical context. In normal circumstances, dingo members belonging to the same pack will interact through communal activities in a friendly manner [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As reported in a study investigating the behaviour of a pack of captive dingoes, the dominance hierarchy found within a pack could occasionally result in aggression from a dominant dingo to a subordinate, although such behaviours appear to have been rarely observed in the wild [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The probability of biting for dingoes within a dingo pack is therefore assumed to be low, and most likely slightly lower than what is expected in community dogs (0.7%–7%; [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]), and was therefore estimated to range between 0.5% and 2%. In contrast, encounters between individuals of neighboring packs can lead to aggressive confrontations, involving fighting, as reported by Corbett et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and Whitehouse [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], as well as Thomson [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] who noted a fighting event in 1 out of 4 observed encounters between individuals of different packs. To reflect this increased level in aggressive behavior, the range of values for the probability of bite given contact between 2 dingoes of different packs was inflated by a factor of 20 with regards to the within-pack probability of bite (0.1–0.4), therefore including the 25% fighting observations from Thomson (40). As dogs exhibiting furious rabies are more likely to bite, we assumed that the behavior of a rabid dingo infected with the furious form during the clinical stage would be twice as aggressive as a healthy dingo meeting a counterpart belonging to another pack. This yields a probability of biting ranging between 0.2–0.8 for a furious rabid dog, consistent with ranges used in a rabies spread model of community dogs [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Furthermore, we assumed that the biting probability of a dingo exhibiting the furious form would be the same, regardless of whether encounters were with an individual from its own or a different pack.</p>
                  <p>Finally, we assigned the probability of a successful rabies transmission, given the event of an infectious dingo (I1 or I2) biting a susceptible dingo, according to a PERT distribution, with the mode (0.49), minimum (0.45) and maximum (0.52) values following the results of Hampson, Dushoff (49).</p>

                  <p>In a large observational study conducted on 957 owned dogs, high proportions (69%) of confirmed rabies-infected dogs were assessed to have the furious form [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The same proportion appears to be lower (37%) in an experimental study with 54 rabid dogs [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and slightly higher (75%) in an observational study conducted on a large sample of 2950 dogs which were mostly categorized as stray [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The latter might overestimate the actual proportion of furious dogs, since roaming dogs suffering from the furious form, which exhibit aggressive behavior, are more likely to be reported as suspected cases. To account for the uncertainty related to this parameter, and giving more weight to the results from the study with a large sample size of owned dogs, a uniform distribution of 0.5–0.75 was used to describe the probability that a rabies-infected dingo develops the furious form, as opposed to the dumb form.</p>

The area of infection was defined as the area covered, at the end of each simulation, by the 95% home range areas of all dingoes that were infected (by dissolving overlapping areas into one, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009124.g003">Fig 3</xref>), based on the standard deviation associated with the rabies form (dumb vs furious) in the season when each dingo became infectious. The area covered by unsuitable habitat during the dry season was excluded from the calculation. The dry season was chosen for this calculation because it comprised unsuitable habitats that were inadequate for both seasons. For the speed of disease spread, we measured the wave of disease spread that was created from the incursion point. The average speed of disease spread (km/week) was calculated as the Euclidian distance between the primary case of infection to the furthest point of infection over the entire simulation, divided by the number of weeks between day 0 and the last transmission event.</p>

The grey zones represent unsuitable habitat for movement of dingoes during the dry season and the dark-beige zone in (D) represents the area of infection. For this particular simulation, the density of dingoes for the dry season was set at 0.135, the primary case occurred at the beginning of the dry season (Dry 1 scenario) and the “Hunter” scenario was selected for the location of the primary case.

Also, similar to Reynolds et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], a binary outcome indicating whether or not the disease has spread to at least 10% of the averaged initial population of dingoes was recorded. This proportion was considered to be a threshold at which the risk of transmission to humans or community dogs becomes important. Since the initial population size fluctuates from one season to another and one simulation to another, the 10% proportion was calculated by using the averaged initial population size based on the total number of simulations ran for output presentation (200,000 simulations, see section <italic>Summary statistics</italic>), so as to obtain comparable numbers from one simulation to another.</p>

                <p>The number of simulations needed to achieve convergence of summary statistics was calculated using a method described by Brookes et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Briefly, the nine outcome measures from the model were recorded for 200,000 simulations. For each outcome measure, an increasing number of outputs (from 1 to 20,000, referred to as “size of simulation set”) were re-sampled randomly from the outputs of the 200,000 simulations. For the continuous outcome measures, only simulations for which the infection has spread to at least one other pack were sampled. This random sampling process was repeated 10 times, resulting in 10 sets of outputs for each size of simulation set (for example, the size of simulation set 200 included 10 sets of outputs, each composed of 200 simulations, the size of simulation set 201 included 10 sets of outputs, each composed of 201 simulations, and so on). The median for continuous outcome measures and the mean for binary outcome measures were calculated for each set of outputs. For each size of simulation set, the coefficient of variation, based on the 10 median/mean outputs of a given outcome measure, was computed. We considered that convergence was achieved for an outcome measure when the coefficient of variation of a size of simulation set was lower than 2.5% for all 100 previous sizes of simulation sets. The location and season scenarios were randomly selected for each of the 200,000 simulations and the convergence testing was performed for all simulations, regardless of scenarios, because this generated the most variance in model outputs. Results of the convergence testing were used to evaluate if 200,000 simulations generated a sufficient number of simulations to report statistical outputs for each scenario.</p>

A random number generator seed was also treated as an additional parameter to absorb the variance caused by the stochasticity of the model [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Consequently, at the beginning of each simulation which was carried out for this exercise, a seed value was randomly sampled from a uniform distribution (0–100).

The model was run 136,000 times using each set of parameters, and these parameters were assigned to all events or individuals and remained fixed throughout each given simulation, regardless of season. Therefore, although the home range size parameter in the present model changed at every half-season as the simulation progressed, for the purpose of sensitivity analysis, the selected value remained fixed throughout the duration of each simulation.

                <p>Overall, considering the 200,000 simulations, a canine rabies outbreak involving more than one dingo pack occurred in 58% of simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009124.g004">Fig 4</xref>). At least 16 dingoes were infected (10% of the average initial population of 159 dingoes) in 35% of simulations. Seventy-six percent and 77% of simulations in which infection spread to &gt;1 pack and &gt;10% of the dingo population, respectively, were initiated by a rabid dingo which developed the furious form of rabies. In contrast, when considering simulations that did not lead to the spread of rabies in &gt;1 pack and &gt;10% of the dingo population, this proportion dropped to 45% and 55%, respectively. In simulations in which &gt; 1 pack was infected, rabies spread at a median speed of 0.52 km/week, infecting a median of 22 dingoes (14% of the average initial population) and 15% of packs, covering a median area of 177 km<sup>2</sup> over a median of 191 days. The median value of R<sub>0</sub> at the dingo level was 3, higher than the median value of 2 at the pack level. Almost all simulations eventually died out (i.e. 97.5% percentile of outbreak duration was equal to 498 days for simulations in which disease spread to at least one other pack). One simulation terminated at the limit of 3 years (149 dingoes infected). Disease spread persisted for &gt;1 year and &gt; 2 years in 6% of simulations (n = 12,190) and 0.1% (n = 181) of simulations, respectively.</p>

                <p>In the first-order Sobol’ sensitivity analyses, for all outcome measures except for R<sub>0</sub> at the dingo level, disease speed and duration of outbreak, home range size and infectious clinical period were the first and the second most influential input parameters of the model, each accounting for 8–23% and 5–8% of the model output variability, respectively. The infectious clinical period was responsible for most of the variance for R<sub>0</sub> at the dingo level (11%) whereas the most dominant parameter for disease speed and duration of outbreak was the incubation period (28% and 18%, respectively), followed by home range size as the second most influential parameter for all three outcome measures (6–10%). All other parameters, except for infectious clinical period in the case of duration of outbreak (7%), contributed less than 5% of model output variability, indicating that these parameters were not significantly influential on their own [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p>
                <p>The sensitivity indices for most parameters were drastically increased when input interactions were taken into account in the total effect analyses, therefore indicating that these parameters strongly interact with each other, and these interactions contribute significantly to the variability of model outputs. Most model input parameters were influential, with total-order sensitivity indices above 5%. Several parameters did not contribute significantly to model variance for most outcome measures, including the home range inflation constant for the dumb form of rabies and the probability of bite for a dingo (No clinical signs/Dumb form) contacting a dingo from the same pack. For each outcome measure, the density, home range size and pack size were found to be the three most dominant ecological parameters of dingoes in the model, whereas the incubation, the infectious pre-clinical and the infectious clinical periods corresponded to the most dominant rabies transmission parameters, each possessing a total-order sensitivity index above 24%, except for R<sub>0</sub> at the dingo level. For the latter outcome measure, density and pack size had greatest influence, explaining more than 50% of the variance.</p>

As an exception, the number of home range days is inversely related to all outcome measures. Similarly, an increase in pack size results in a decrease in the proportion of simulations with more than one infected pack and the speed of disease spread. In addition to these two outcomes measures, the incubation period is also inversely related to the area of infection. Consistent with the findings from the first-order Sobol’ sensitivity analyses, we observe that the infectious clinical period is strongly related to R<sub>0</sub> at the dingo level, the incubation period results in a significant decrease and increase in disease speed and duration of outbreak, respectively, and the home range size causes a drastic increase in all other model outputs. A horizontal trend line is noticed in the random seed number parameter for each outcome measure, indicating that model outputs are independent of the selection of the random seed number, as expected.</p>

              <p>Our study is the first to model the spatial spread of rabies within the dingo population of northern Australia based on robust field-derived ecological parameters, including movement and density of the NPA dingo population. Furthermore, the incorporation of rabies-induced behavioural changes and seasonal fluctuations in ecological processes, including landscape barriers, dingo births, and home range sizes, provides a realistic representation of the potential wildlife-mediated rabies-dingo system in our study area. The key predictions of our model include the high likelihood that one single infected dingo would lead to the spread of rabies in the population, with the potential of outbreaks of considerable size (in terms of number of dingoes infected, spatial coverage and duration), therefore posing a substantial risk for public health.</p>
              <p>According to our model, we estimate that there is a 58% probability of rabies spreading between dingo packs and a 35% probability of an outbreak of significant size occurring when the disease is introduced into a susceptible dingo population in the NPA. However, despite the incorporation of population turnover in the model, including the introduction of young susceptible dingoes into the population and dispersal of individuals in areas which could be surrounded by infected packs, our results suggest a high probability that outbreaks are self-limiting within a year (~94%). Hence, in contrast to the findings from Johnstone-Robertson, et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], our model indicates that the establishment of a sustained rabies infection is unlikely in the NPA dingo population. A mixture of ecological characteristics specific to our target population might explain this frequent disease die-off. Our previous field studies have shown that dingo density and home range size in the NPA are in the lower range of values reported in the literature, consistent with estimates from other Australian subtropical and tropical environments [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. As demonstrated in the global sensitivity analyses of our model, both parameters have a strong influence on spread of disease. Along with the low NPA dingo density estimates, individuals from our model were further grouped into packs, resulting in a sparse spatial distribution of packs across the study area, interrupted by landscape features including the ocean coast and various waterbodies. Despite the high rate of rabies transmission between members of the same pack—as evidenced by the large median value of R<sub>0</sub> at the dingo level—the daily probability of contact between individuals of neighboring packs declines sharply as distance between packs increases and as home range sizes decrease, thus facilitating disease die-out.</p>
              <p>On a similar note, the median speed of propagation of the epizootic front in the present study (i.e. 0.52 km/week) is less than half that predicted from another rabies spread model [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (i.e. 67 km/year, which corresponds to 1.3 km/week). In addition to differences in parameterisation as discussed above, this dissimilarity could also be attributed to different calculation approaches in disease spread. In the latter study, the epidemic speed was calculated for simulations in which the disease has percolated beyond a distance of 120 km, as opposed to our study in which the propagation speed was calculated from all simulations in which the disease has spread beyond one infected pack, including outbreaks of smaller magnitude as well as larger outbreaks. Our results are nonetheless consistent with, albeit at the lower end of the range, field data from rabies infection in domestic dogs (0.5 km/week) [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and foxes (0.57–1.15 km/week) and simulation results from rabies spread models in foxes (0.8 km/week) [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p>
              <p>The scenario in which a dingo contracts rabies from a domestic dog roaming freely around the communities, as opposed to the hunter scenario, leads to the largest outbreak sizes in terms of space, time and population infected. Furthermore, this scenario implicitly involves a higher risk for public health, due to the proximity of the initial spread of rabies in the dingo population and members of the communities. Concomitantly, the chances of early detection of the outbreak are increased due to proximity of this area to human populations, and the spread of rabies might consequently be easier to contain if timely control measures (such as vaccination) are established in the dingo population. The smaller outbreak outcomes in the hunter scenario could be explained by the fact that the areas with the highest risk of interaction between hunting dogs and dingoes are located towards the tip of the peninsula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009124.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In this scenario, the spread of rabies is limited to the south only, compared to other potential incursion points in the study area which allow multi-directional spread. Compared to other scenarios, the slightly lower proportion of simulations with &gt;1 infected pack in the community scenario might be the reflection of the close proximity of the primary case to the ocean coast, thus reducing the likelihood of a successful transmission to another pack. However, compared to the hunter scenario, once this first inter-pack transmission is achieved, the magnitude of the outbreak is expected to be larger.</p>
              <p>As anticipated, the likelihood of rabies successfully spreading beyond the first infected pack and the corresponding spatial extent of the outbreak tends to be greater when rabies is introduced during the dry season. In fact, the larger amount of area traversed per day during the dry season (greater home range size relative to the number of home range days), reflecting the necessity for dingoes to intensify their level of roaming activity over large distances due to the scarcity of food and water resource availability in the dry season, will increase the probability of contact of dingoes between neighboring packs, resulting in larger outbreaks and larger areas infected. This is consistent with Sparkes et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] who proposed that dingoes from resource poor areas, which usually occupy home ranges of greater extent, may be responsible for the spread of rabies over a larger land area. Furthermore, spatial heterogeneity is more extensive in the wet season, as the habitat is composed of a greater proportion of natural barriers to dingo movement, consequently reducing the probability of contact between packs. Various modelling studies have revealed that natural landscape features, such as rivers, can act as an effective barrier to animal movement and consequently impede rabies flow [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], consistent with the findings of our model.</p>
              <p>The three ecological parameters with the greatest influence on model outputs are based on data either estimated directly from the field (i.e. density and home range size) or derived from observations of the dingo population in our study area (i.e. pack size). The variance in model outcomes resulting from these parameters is expected to reflect the uncertainty in our estimates measured from the field as well as seasonal and individual fluctuations in the natural processes of our study area, rather than uncertainty resulting from the use of a large range of plausible values due to knowledge gaps in the literature. However, the variance of the home range size may have been underestimated since the range used for this parameter in the model was based on the 95% confidence interval from the mean home range size estimate of the population, as opposed to individual variability. Consistent with the global sensitivity analysis findings from other rabies spread simulations in domestic dogs [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the incubation and clinical periods strongly influence model outcomes in our model. Once again, these parameters have been documented extensively through field and experimental studies and have been proven to vary greatly at an individual level. In contrast, data in the literature regarding the preclinical infectious period is limited. Given the sensitivity of model outputs to this parameter, further research in this area would help improve rabies spread model predictions. Although not ranked as the most influential variables, rabies spread parameters related to the furious form of rabies are shown to have a significant impact on most outcome measures. These results, which are based on the model’s assumption, support the hypothesis that furious dogs considerably affect rabies outbreaks, and are consistent with the findings from a previous modelling study which evaluated the influence of rabies-induced behavioural parameters on predicted rabies outbreaks in domestic dogs [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Other rabies spread parameters which denoted high uncertainty due to the lack of available information in the literature, notably the home range inflation constant for the dumb form of rabies and the probability of bite for healthy or dumb-infected individuals, are not found to be influential.</p>
              <p>The evaluation of the input-outcome relationships allowed the improved understanding of the behavior of each parameter in the model. From this analysis, two unanticipated findings were identified regarding the incubation period and pack size parameters. First, as expected, an increase in the incubation period resulted in the duration of outbreaks to lengthen and the speed of disease spread to diminish, since the time between transmission events would increase accordingly. On the other hand, the incubation period’s slight negative relationship with the area of infection and the probability of disease spread to &gt;1 pack is not as straightforward. Considering that approximately 21% of the dingo population dies of natural cause within a year in the model, a possible explanation is that when the incubation period increases, the likelihood of a latently infected dingo dying of a natural cause before reaching the infectious pre-clinical stage also increases, thus preventing the transmission of rabies. Second, the positive influence of the pack size that was found on the number of infected dingoes, the proportion of infected packs, R<sub>0</sub> at the dingo level and the proportion of simulations with infection of &gt;10% of the dingo population can be explained by an increased number of dingoes that one rabid individual can potentially infect within its pack. However, the pack size also has a direct impact on the spatial distribution of packs; as the number of dingoes within each pack expands, the total number of packs to reach the initial population estimate within the study area diminishes, resulting in a sparser distribution of packs. Contact between members of different packs is thus inhibited, which may explain the observed lower disease speed and probability of infecting &gt;1 pack as pack size increases.</p>
              <p>The disease spread dynamics in our model were fundamentally based on the concept of space sharing between individuals [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The application of a bivariate normal function allowed us to define the probability density of an animal’s use of space, similar to an animal’s utilization distribution [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], leading to a relatively simple and, to our knowledge, novel equation for estimating the probability of contact between individuals (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pntd.0009124.e004">Eq 4</xref>). This formula could be applied to other animal populations in which utilization distribution estimates are unavailable, yet population densities and home range sizes are known. One important caveat with our probability of contact approach is our assumption of a circular home range distribution, meaning that the probability distribution is the same in all directions. The home range distributions of dingoes in the NPA are most likely a complex function involving multiple spatial attributes in the study area such as resource focal points, landscape barriers, and corridor pathways used by dingoes to travel through the dense vegetation. However, considering the lack of evidence supporting a specific home range shape in our study area, we believe that this assumption represents a valid approximation of the actual dingo movement in the NPA. The use of GPS collars on the NPA dingo population could provide precise information on the shape of the home range distributions and the variability in home range size between individuals.</p>
              <p>The clustering of dingoes into pack entities allowed assessment of contact at 2 levels. Differences in the intra and inter-pack contact probabilities were consistent with the close social behaviors for members of a same pack as opposed to the low frequency of observed interactions of individuals from different packs in the wild [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Contact heterogeneity between members of different packs was incorporated in part by the propensity of each individual to roam around its home range centroid point (determined by the home range size and number of home range days). However, dingoes were assumed to roam randomly within their respective home range distribution and independently to dingoes from other packs, which might not always be a valid assumption because dingoes might exhibit a large range of social behaviors ranging from active avoidance to attraction during the mating period. The incorporation of a more realistic representation of the heterogeneous social behavior inherent to dingoes, which most likely varies according to breeding seasons and individual characteristics such as sex and age, could contribute to improved model outcome predictions. However, dingo contact behaviour represents a major research gap in the literature, especially in tropical and equatorial ecosystems of northern Australia where data is non-existent [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and highlights the need for future research in this field.</p>
              <p>It is important to note that the present model was restricted to a small area to avoid extrapolation of our data to a population with differing ecological characteristics. Thus, although our model indicates that the ecological characteristics in the NPA will most likely not support a sustained infection within the dingo population, we did not evaluate whether rabies spread would be likely to stop naturally or continue its path southward, infecting contiguous dingo populations in Queensland. Furthermore, the particular context of our study area, with consistent opportunities for interactions between NPA community dogs and dingoes, could facilitate the development of overlapping domestic dog-mediated and wildlife-mediated rabies cycles, which may be sufficient to allow for endemicity. Considering the proximity of Indigenous community members to dingo habitat and increasing evidence of the presence of dingoes in and around the NPA communities [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the potential of a large and long-lasting rabies outbreak in the NPA dingo population represents a significant risk for rabies transmission to humans. The findings of this study therefore highlight the importance of preventing the introduction of rabies into the NPA by implementing effective surveillance and prevention measures within this high-risk area for rabies incursion.</p>
              <p>Two main strategic directions in terms of control interventions can be considered in light of the main findings of the present study. Firstly, in the event that rabies is detected within the NPA dingo population or the domestic dogs in the communities, control strategies should prioritize vaccination of the domestic dogs as they represent a direct threat to humans. Moreover, vaccination programs involving distribution of oral vaccine baits targeting dingoes, a commonly used and effective technique to control rabies spread in wild carnivores [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], could strategically target zones around the communities as a priority, considering that infection in this area is associated with larger outbreaks leading to a greater spatial spread. This approach could also assist in preventing an incursion or re-incursion of rabies into the dingo population from a clinically or sub-clinically infectious free-roaming dog, as well as providing barriers around the communities by reducing the risk of rabies transmission from infectious dingoes to susceptible community dogs and, ultimately, to humans. To test this hypothesis, various control measures which might be implemented in the NPA dingo population in the face of a rabies outbreak, including spatially strategic control programs that would accommodate for heterogeneity in landscape features [<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009124.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], could be further explored using the present rabies spread model.</p>
