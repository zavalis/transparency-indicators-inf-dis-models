              <abstract>
                <p>Conventional empirical studies of foodborne-disease outbreaks (FDOs) in agricultural markets are linear-stochastic formulations hardwiring a world in which markets self-correct in response to external random shocks including FDOs. These formulations were unequipped to establish whether FDOs cause market reaction, or whether markets endogenously propagate outbreaks. We applied nonlinear time series analysis (NLTS) to reconstruct annual dynamics of FDOs in US cattle markets from CDC outbreak data, live cattle futures market prices, and USDA cattle inventories from 1967–2018, and used reconstructed dynamics to detect causality. Reconstructed deterministic nonlinear market dynamics are endogenously unstable—not self-correcting, and cattle inventories drive futures prices and FDOs attributed to beef in temporal patterns linked to a multi-decadal cattle cycle undetected in daily/weekly price movements investigated previously. Benchmarking real-world dynamics with NLTS offers more informative and credible empirical modeling at the convergence of natural and economic sciences.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Foodborne diseases impose substantial economic burden worldwide. In the US, there are approximately 48 million foodborne illnesses each year costing over $15 billion annually [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Twenty percent of these illnesses (9.4 million) is attributed to known bacterial, parasitic, and viral pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Depending on the pathogen, symptoms of foodborne illness to consumers may be severe—including bloody diarrhea, fever, severe stomach pain, vomiting, and kidney failure—and result in hospitalization and even death.</p>
              <p>Past empirical economic models have investigated the reaction of agricultural markets to foodborne disease outbreaks (FDOs) with a variety of linear-stochastic specifications [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] used in “most empirical investigations of agricultural markets”([<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], p. 114). In conformity to dominant theory, linear modeling hardwires stable agricultural markets that equilibrate as rational agents process all available information to re-adjust supply and demand in response to exogenous random FDO shocks. Short-term net price impacts are expected to be negative as negative price impacts of downward shifts in demand for contaminated food dominate positive price impacts of inward shifts in supply (e.g., from government recalls) [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Eventually, agricultural markets are expected to stabilize (‘self-correct’), so past work searched for downward price spikes from when an FDO shock occurred to when the market returned to ‘normal’ levels [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Lusk and Schroeder (2002) attributed the inability of “our models [to] detect the market reaction” (p. 58) to inadequate representation of market dynamics; in particular, the “[possibility] that the impacts of recalls on meat demand are more cumulative in nature and gradually reduce market demand over time instead of causing notable short-run declines” (p. 57). They conjectured that “if there is any systematic change in cattle and hog demand due to recalls, it likely occurs over an extended period of time” (p. 47). They further conjectured that “futures markets may not react to meat recalls because…the market has already incorporated this information” (p. 57). Futures prices factor in expected movements in spot prices (payments for immediate delivery of a commodity). Downward price spikes would not be detected if traders had already factored in expected negative market consequences of FDOs and were forecasting economic recoveries.</p>
              <p>In this paper, we empirically map out causal interactions between agricultural market variables and FDOs applying recently-developed data-driven methods in the science and mathematical statistics literature. We extend past work that relied on regression techniques to measure marginal relationships among variables. Regression coefficients do not imply causality, but rather <italic>cum hoc non propter hoc</italic> (`with this, not because of this’). Selecting an appropriate causal detection method depends critically on the nature of underlying system dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The popular Granger causality-detection method [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] is designed for use with linear-stochastic systems like those conventionally used to model agricultural markets. Linear-stochastic systems impose linear separability among variables, which implies that “information about a causative factor is independently unique to that variable (e.g., information about predator effects is not contained in time series for the prey), and can be removed by eliminating that variable from the model” [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Consequently, variable <italic>X</italic> Granger-causes <italic>Y</italic> if the predictability of <italic>Y</italic> decreases when <italic>X</italic> is removed from the set of possible causal factors.</p>
              <p>However, Sugihara et al. (2012) demonstrated that Granger causality gives unreliable results when system dynamics are not linearly separable. In <italic>weakly-coupled</italic> systems, deterministic nonlinear interactions encode information about <italic>X</italic> into <italic>Y</italic>, and this information does not disappear from <italic>Y</italic> when <italic>X</italic> is removed from the system. As noted by the famous naturalist John Muir (1911), “When we try to pick something up by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe” [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Sugihara et al. (2012) developed the <italic>Convergent Cross Mapping</italic> (CCM) method to detect causal networks in real-world systems diagnosed with deterministic nonlinear dynamics.</p>
              <p>Deterministic nonlinear dynamics offer a possible alternative approach for capturing the cumulative systematic interactions between agricultural market variables and FDOs proposed by Lusk and Schroeder (2002). Chavas and Holt (1993) questioned reflex reliance on self-correcting linear agricultural market models in light of emerging results demonstrating that instability can emerge endogenously from nonlinear dynamic systems [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245867.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Agricultural markets need not self-correct to ‘normal’ levels due to destabilizing endogenous factors including highly inelastic demands [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245867.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; nonlinear cobweb price expectations [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; and financial, institutional, and biophysical constraints frustrating supply from matching demand [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. <italic>The Economist</italic> recently recommended that “like physicists, [economists] should study instability instead of assuming that economies naturally self-correct” [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>Consequently, our first task is to select the appropriate empirical causal-detection method by diagnosing whether observational data on agricultural marketing variables and FDOs are most likely generated by linear-stochastic or deterministic-nonlinear system dynamics. We make this diagnosis with <italic>Nonlinear Time Series Analysis</italic> (NLTS)—an inductive science approach in which scientists “are presented with observations and asked… to go backward to solve for [the system] that made them”([<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], p. 110). NLTS is designed to empirically reconstruct real-world <italic>phase-space</italic> dynamics from the observational data they generate without prior knowledge of system equations [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
              <p>In a nutshell, phase space is the graphical portrayal of system dynamics. Phase space coordinates are provided by system variables. Each <italic>n</italic>-dimensional point in phase space records the levels (states) of <italic>n</italic> system variables at a point in time. Phase space trajectories connecting these points depict the co-evolution of system variables from given initial states. If system dynamics are <italic>dissipative</italic>, trajectories converge toward an attractor–a geometric object bounded within an <italic>m</italic>-dimensional subset of <italic>n</italic>-dimensional phase space (<italic>m</italic>&lt;&lt;<italic>n</italic>). Once a trajectory evolves along an attractor, it never escapes [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Consequently, dissipative dynamics may be dimension-reducing since long-term behavior occurs wholly within a reduced <italic>m</italic>-dimensional subspace. The problem of modeling system dynamics shrinks by the <italic>n</italic>-<italic>m</italic> inactive dimensions [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
              <p>To apply NLTS, we proceed as if system variables are weakly coupled, and then statistically test the veracity of this assumption at a later stage. This assumption allows us to reconstruct phase-space dynamics from even a single time series variable with <italic>delay-coordinate embedding</italic>, in which time-delayed copies of an observed variable provide surrogates for omitted but weakly-coupled covariates [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. An attractor reconstructed in delay-coordinate phase space is called a <italic>shadow</italic> attractor. <italic>Takens</italic> theorem states conditions guaranteeing that delay-coordinate embedding is a one-to-one mapping of points from the shadow to the original attractor, and thus preserves essential mathematical properties [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We use <italic>surrogate data</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to statistically test whether apparent geometric regularity in a reconstructed shadow attractor is most likely systematically generated by deterministic-nonlinear dynamics (indicating CCM causality detection), or fortuitously generated by linear-stochastic dynamics (indicating Granger causality detection).</p>
              <p>Following past studies [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], we focus on live cattle futures prices traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as a market performance variable embedding national expectations of how supply and demand adjust to FDOs attributed to beef. Live cattle are ‘finished’ products that have reached the necessary weight for processing [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Supply and demand factors for beef typically play the biggest role in determining live cattle prices. We include the annual inventory of US cattle on feed touted by commodities brokerage firms to be a key indicator of future live cattle supply [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
              <p>Past work represents FDOs attributed to beef indirectly with indices weighing the length and severity of government recalls of contaminated meat. Alternatively, we represent FDOs attributed to beef with actual reported outbreaks collected on the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS) by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We discuss these time series in detail below.</p>
              <p>As reported below, our NLTS results show that observed data on the above-mentioned variables are most likely generated by deterministic-nonlinear food system dynamics. Consequently, we applied CCM to test for the following causal interactions: Do FDOs attributed to beef cause a market response in live cattle futures prices? Do beef market variables drive FDOs attributed to beef? In other words, do beef markets propagate their own outbreaks? We might well expect this given that foodborne infections are transmitted systematically from ‘farm to fork’ along food supply chains [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>

                <title>FDOs attributed to beef</title>
                <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collect national time series records on FDOs reported by state public health agencies with the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS). FDOSS defines FDOs as “the occurrence of two or more cases of a similar illness resulting from consuming a common food.” In annual reports available from 1967–2016, ‘total’ outbreaks (‘confirmed’ and ‘unconfirmed’) are differentiated among food groups and summed over etiologies (i.e., bacterial, parasitic, viral, and unknown pathogens). We downloaded these from the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) Dashboard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/fdoss/annual-reports/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/fdoss/annual-reports/index.html</ext-link>). NORS provides a web-based platform (launched in 2009) that local, state, and territorial health departments in the U.S. use to report FDOs and other types of infectious disease outbreaks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/nor/">https://www.cdc.gov/nor/</ext-link>). Annual CDC reports are not available for the years 2003–2005 and 2009–2010. To fill in missing years, and extend the time-series record to 2018, we used annual counts of national FDOs maintained in parallel on the NORS Dashboard starting in 1998 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/norsdashboard/">https://wwwn.cdc.gov/norsdashboard/</ext-link>). In results reported below, we found that this combination of sources did not create a nonstationary record that would have signaled abrupt shifts in dynamic behavior.</p>

                <title>NLTS methods</title>
                <p>We outline a five-stage procedure for reconstructing B-FDO dynamics in the US cattle market from monitoring data with NLTS methods, and provide more detailed discussion of each method in an appendix. NLTS methods are covered in depth in original papers cited in the text, application papers [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and introductory books [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245867.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245867.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
                <p>In Stage 1, we apply <italic>Singular Spectrum Analysis</italic> (SSA) [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] to decompose each standardized time-series record into structured variation (signal)—composed of low-frequency trend and nonlinear trend cycles, and higher-frequency oscillatory components—and unstructured variation (noise) [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245867.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. SSA measures signal strength as the portion of total variance in a record explained by the signal, and thus gives an initial indication of whether there is adequate structure to merit further search for deterministic-nonlinear structure with NLTS. In Stage 2, we apply <italic>Singular Spectrum Transformation</italic> (SST) [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] to screen strong signals for <italic>change-points</italic> indicating abrupt shifts in dynamic structure during the period-of-record that violate nonlinear stationarity required by NLTS. In Stage 3, we test strong stationary signals for deterministic-nonlinear dynamic structure. We reconstruct shadow phase space from each signal with time- delay embedding, which uses delayed copies of a signal as surrogates for other variables. We use surrogate data to test whether apparent geometric regularity in a shadow attractor is generated fortuitously by linear-stochastic dynamics as opposed to deterministic nonlinear dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245867.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In Stage 4, we apply <italic>Convergent Cross Mapping</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (CCM) to detect pairwise causal interactions among signals evincing deterministic nonlinear dynamic structure. The logic behind CCM is that shadow attractors reconstructed from interacting variables map one-to-one with the same real-world attractor, and thus map one-to-one with each other. We further apply <italic>Extended-CCM</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] to screen detected interactions for false positives in which synchronized behavior is mistaken for causal interaction. In Stage 5, we apply the <italic>S-Mapping</italic> method [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to quantify interactions identified with CCM as partial derivatives measuring marginal changes in a response variable to incremental increases in a driving variable.</p>

The B-FDO multi-decadal trend cycle is strikingly similar to the CI multi-decadal trend cycle.

                <p>On a final note, the CDC conjectured that the steep upswing in reported total outbreaks in 1998 is a break in the record caused by the adoption of enhanced outbreak surveillance measures (see Annual Report for years 1998–2002). There was also a steep upswing in B-FDO in 1998 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245867.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, grey curve). However, as reported above, SST screening did not detect a change point in B-FDO in 1998, indicating that enhanced surveillance by the CDC did not make the B-FDO record nonstationary. A possible contributing endogenous explanation for the upswing in B-FDO in 1998 is that outbreaks were trending upward along with cattle inventories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245867.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, red curve).</p>

Moreover, each CCM curve is statistically significant since it rests above a bootstrapped 95% lower confidence bound (dashed curves) computed with surrogate data as detailed in the appendix.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>NLTS is an inductive science approach that infers causal structure from observational data, as opposed to a conventional reductionist modeling approach that “assume[s] that we already knew the causal structure in order to make measurements of causal strengths and to conduct counterfactual analysis”([<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], p. 37). As such, NLTS provides positive analysis of behavior that ‘actually happened’. Comparing this to what ‘should have happened’ in the judgement of the researcher may well be inaccurate without direct knowledge of the internal business objectives of cattle producers, consumers, and futures traders. Economic agents realizing undesireable outcomes might have avoided the behavior in hindsight. We are limited to speculating a few of many possible explanations for causal behavior uncovered by NLTS diagnostics.</p>
              <p>We first diagnosed that observational data on agricultural marketing variables and FDOs are most likely generated by deterministic-nonlinear system dynamics, which directed us to the <italic>Convergent Cross Mapping</italic> (CCM) causal-detection method based on state-space reconstruction techniques. This finding is interesting in and of itself because it offers empirical evidence of the recognized theoretical possibility that real-world agricultural markets can be endogenously unstable and not naturally self-correct to external shocks [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245867.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245867.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>
              <p>We uncovered moderately strong causal interactions among the beef market covariates included in this research:</p>
              <p>First, CI drives B-FDO, providing empirical evidence that outbreaks are endogenously generated by the beef market. SSA signal processing of comparable standardized values demonstrated that causality from CI to B-FDO has expressed itself in a multi-decadal trend cycle in CI that is tracked to a surprising degree by a multi-decadal trend cycle in B-FDO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245867.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Together these results suggest that the multi-decadal CI trend cycle provides a quick and informative predictor of long-term trends in outbreak occurrence based on rigorous empirical causality testing.</p>
              <p>That the supply side of the beef market causes its own outbreaks is consistent with documented pathogenic contamination of meat products along slaughter lines, and during processing, storage, and preparation [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. It is also consistent with economic explanations partially attributing foodborne disease to market failures that weaken the profit incentives of suppliers to invest in greater preventative measures against foodborne pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245867.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Similar to ‘lemons’ in used-car markets, consumers cannot easily recognize a defective product before purchase since pathogens are not detectable by sight or smell. After purchase, consumers cannot easily tie illness to the source of contamination—whether foodborne, and if so, which food and supplier. Similar to ‘credence goods’, consumers cannot easily substantiate the labeling or advertising food-safety claims of suppliers and industry-promoting regulatory agencies. As a result, consumers lack full market information that would allow them to confidently assess their willingness to pay for increased food safety, and given uncertain returns, suppliers lack clear profit incentives to incur the extra cost of providing more than minimum allowable levels of food safety.</p>
              <p>An anonymous reviewer offered an alternative economic explanation for why beef outbreaks marginally increase in response to contractions in the cattle inventory not relying on market externalities. Producers may pay less attention to profits and management when contracting supply. In addition, consumers may pay less attention to the risk of foodborne illness when supply is short, and be misled by associated increased prices in presuming that higher-valued beef is safer.</p>
              <p>Second, the annual cattle inventory (CI) drives live cattle futures prices (LCFprice), providing empirical evidence that traders have relied on CI as an key indicator of future supply conditions of live cattle as advised by commodity brokerage firms.</p>
              <p>Perhaps surprising is the temporal regularity displayed by the above two causal interactions driven by CI when the multi-decadal cattle cycle isolated by SSA signal processing is below average. B-FDO predominantly marginally increases in response to increased CI when CI is contracted along the multi-decadal cycle. Of interest to traders, the marginal response of LCFprice to increased CI is predominantly positive when CI is contracted.</p>
              <p>Cattle cycles occur systematically because producers, constrained by the reproductive biology of livestock, cannot instantly adjust inventories in response to price changes. Cattle cycles typically comprise three to four year ‘liquidation phases’ when cattle are sold off, and six to eight year ‘accumulation phases’ when herds are rebuilt. Indeed, SSA isolated cycles in cattle inventories of approximately six to nine years, which combined to explain 23% of total variation. In addition, SSA detected that these higher-frequency cattle cycles follow a stronger multi-decadal nonlinear trend cycle of about thirty years, accounting for almost 60% of total variation.</p>
              <p>Third, B-FDO drives LCFprice, providing empirical evidence of agricultural market response to foodborne disease outbreaks that was expected but largely undetected in past studies. Confirming conjectures by Lusk and Schroeder (2002), the market reaction in our study was cumulative and endogenized into systematic long-term beef market dynamics. The market response is predominantly positive when the multi-decadal standardized B-FDO cycle isolated by SSA signal processing is below average (1980–1997), and otherwise more erratic. Past studies expected negative net price response on the basis that negative price impacts of downward shifts in demand for contaminated food would dominate positive price impacts of inward shifts in supply; however, the positive net price responses that we computed were also deemed possible [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>

              <title>Concluding comments</title>
              <p>We conclude with a broad caveat. Although we successfully reconstructed deterministic nonlinear dynamics from observational data in this case study, we cannot reasonably expect to do so in every application. Most obviously, the dynamics of a real-world system might not evolve along a low-dimensional nonlinear attractor. Moreover, available data may not adequately sample an existing real-world attractor. In general, we cannot reasonably expect to have observational data of sufficient quality to reconstruct the complex folding and fractal patterns of a real-world attractor [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We can reasonably hope to reconstruct the ‘sampling’ or ‘skeleton’ of a real-world attractor [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] if available data are long enough to represent the dominant time scales of the system, or not too noisy to detect deterministic behavior.</p>
              <p>We recommend that food safety modelers take advantage of NLTS to initially test for systematic dynamic behavior in observed data before formulating policy models that fail to reflect this valuable information. NLTS data analytics provide a reliable empirical benchmark to guide specification and testing of new theoretical framings at the convergence of natural and economic sciences. This benchmark includes a geometric picture of real-world state space dynamics that models should be able to reproduce, an estimate of the minimum model dimensionality required, and identification of relevant model covariates and their interactions over time.</p>

                <title>Surrogate data</title>
                <p>Surrogate data testing [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245867.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] proceeds in three steps: First, null hypotheses are formulated to test for stochastic dynamic structures in a time series, and surrogate data vectors are computed compatible with these hypotheses. Surrogates destroy the serial structure of the time series while preserving statistical properties compatible with the null hypothesis. We computed <italic>PPS</italic> surrogates with an algorithm formulated by Small and Tse (2002), which test for noisy linear dynamics in cyclic time-series records. Second, a shadow attractor is reconstructed from each surrogate, and a discriminating statistic is computed measuring a hallmark of nonlinear deterministic behavior in each surrogate attractor. We selected nonlinear prediction skill [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] as a statistic that could be reliably computed from our data, and specified an upper-tailed test since deterministic-nonlinear structure is consistent with high nonlinear prediction skill, measured by the Nash-Sutcliffe Model Efficiency (NSE) [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Third, applying rank-order statistics [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], an ensemble of <italic>S</italic> = (<italic>k</italic>/<italic>α</italic>)−1 surrogates is generated, where <italic>α</italic> is the probability of false rejection and <italic>k</italic> controls the number of surrogates and consequently the sensitivity of the test. Setting <italic>α</italic> = 0.05 and <italic>k</italic> = 20, we accepted the null hypothesis of linear stochastic dynamics if the NSE taken from the shadow attractor reconstructed from the time series did not fall in the upper <italic>k</italic> values of NSE statistics taken from the ensemble of <italic>S</italic> = 399 surrogate attractors. If the null hypothesis is rejected, untested dynamic structures (i.e., nonlinear-deterministic dynamics) remain viable.</p>

                <title>Convergent cross mapping</title>
                <p>CCM [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] finds that <italic>X</italic> is driven by <italic>Y</italic> if the shadow attractor reconstructed from <italic>X</italic> (<italic>M</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub>) can skillfully cross-predict values of <italic>Y</italic>. The goodness-of-fit between cross-predicted and actual values of <italic>Y</italic> is measured with the Pearson correlation coefficient (<italic>ρ</italic>). Convergence in CCM requires that cross prediction become more skillful (i.e., <italic>ρ</italic> converges to an acceptable level) as the portion of the record for <italic>X</italic> used to reconstruct <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub> (the <italic>library</italic>) increases in length; in other words, as the structural information in <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub> increases. We further applied Extended-CCM [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] to screen skillful cross mappings for false positives in which synchronized behavior is mistaken for causal interaction [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Extended-CCM performs cross mappings over a spectrum of negative and positive delayed responses between driving variable <italic>Y</italic> and response variable <italic>X</italic>. If <italic>Y</italic> truly drives <italic>X</italic>, CCM performs best for a non-positive delayed response since true causality requires that causal events occur before (or contemporaneously with) provoked responses. Finally, we screened cross mappings for statistical significance by testing whether a shadow attractor <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub> reconstructed from response variable <italic>X</italic> cross-predicts the potential driving variable <italic>Y</italic> with higher skill than it cross-predicts an ensemble of randomized PPS surrogate data vectors [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] constructed from <italic>Y</italic>. We ran CCM for <italic>S</italic> = (<italic>k</italic>/<italic>α</italic>)−1 = 399 surrogate data vectors (<italic>k</italic> = 20 and <italic>α</italic> = 0.05) and rejected the null hypothesis that <italic>Y</italic> is not a significant driver of <italic>X</italic> if the corresponding correlation coefficient was among the top <italic>k</italic> = 20 values computed with surrogate data vectors over a convergent subset of libraries. The floor of these upper surrogate correlation coefficients is portrayed graphically as a bootstrapped 95% confidence interval that a significant cross mapping curve exceeds.</p>

                <p>S-Mapping [<xref rid="pone.0245867.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] quantifies interactions identified with CCM. To compute the marginal response of <italic>X</italic> to <italic>Y</italic>, we first reconstructed a shadow attractor with phase space coordinates including <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic>, and built in the delayed response detected with Extended-CCM. S-Mapping computes the curvature of phase space at each point on a shadow attractor with a locally-weighted multivariate linear regression scheme. Estimated regression coefficients measure slopes in the direction of each coordinate variable at each point, and these slopes serve as partial derivatives of the response variable with respect to the driving variables in each time period.</p>
