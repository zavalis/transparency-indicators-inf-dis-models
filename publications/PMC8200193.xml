              <abstract>
                <p>The Greater Accra Region is the smallest of the 16 administrative regions in Ghana. It is highly populated and characterized by tropical climatic conditions. Although efforts towards malaria control in Ghana have had positive impacts, malaria remains in the top five diseases reported at healthcare facilities within the Greater Accra Region. To further accelerate progress, analysis of regionally generated data is needed to inform control and management measures at this level. This study aimed to examine the climatic drivers of malaria transmission in the Greater Accra Region and identify inter-district variation in malaria burden. Monthly malaria cases for the Greater Accra Region were obtained from the Ghanaian District Health Information and Management System. Malaria cases were decomposed using seasonal-trend decomposition, based on locally weighted regression to analyze seasonality. A negative binomial regression model with a conditional autoregressive prior structure was used to quantify associations between climatic variables and malaria risk and spatial dependence. Posterior parameters were estimated using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with Gibbs sampling. A total of 1,105,370 malaria cases were recorded in the region from 2015 to 2019. The overall malaria incidence for the region was approximately 47 per 1000 population. Malaria transmission was highly seasonal with an irregular inter-annual pattern. Monthly malaria case incidence was found to decrease by 2.3% (95% credible interval: 0.7–4.2%) for each 1 °C increase in monthly minimum temperature. Only five districts located in the south-central part of the region had a malaria incidence rate lower than the regional average at &gt;95% probability level. The distribution of malaria cases was heterogeneous, seasonal, and significantly associated with climatic variables. Targeted malaria control and prevention in high-risk districts at the appropriate time points could result in a significant reduction in malaria transmission in the Greater Accra Region.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Malaria is a preventable and treatable infectious disease caused by plasmodium parasites. The disease is commonly transmitted through the bite of an infected female <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito. Other routes include mother to child transmission, whereby infected cells from the mother are transferred to the fetus through the placenta, transfusion of infected blood to a healthy individual, donation of infected organs, and through needle stick injuries among healthcare workers and intravenous drug users [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, these are considered minor sources of transmission. In 2019, an estimated 229 million new malaria cases and 409,000 malaria deaths occurred globally [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, this burden is not distributed evenly. It is estimated that around 93% of malaria cases occur in the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region. Additionally, the group most vulnerable to malaria infection are children under five years of age, accounting for 67% of the total malaria mortality burden [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Malaria transmission is affected by multidimensional factors, linked to vector characteristics, climatic conditions, land cover, genetics, and human behavior [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These disparate factors mean that malaria transmission rates can vary significantly at local levels. Temperature and rainfall affect the life cycle and breeding of the mosquito by enabling the parasite to complete its life cycle, thus increasing the transmissibility of the disease to humans [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>Similar to other endemic countries, malaria is a major cause of morbidity and is the leading cause of mortality in Ghana [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The country experienced half a million new cases of malaria in 2018, or 3% of all global malaria cases, and around 11,000 deaths [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The total number of active malaria cases is currently around 6.6 million, from a population of 29 million people. WHO guidelines for malaria control incorporate vector control measures using insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), and prompt diagnosis and treatment. These control measures are further supported by implementation of the intermittent preventive therapy protocol (IPTp) in pregnant women [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In Ghana, the adoption of these approaches, together with increased health promotion and educational campaigns, has led to significant reductions in malaria incidence and mortality [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Malaria-associated mortality had been reduced by 14.8% in 2016 compared to 2010 [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Case fatality rates in children under five years experienced a 4% reduction within the same timeframe. In addition, the facility-based malaria fatality rate for children under five years reduced from 14% in 2000 to 0.5% in 2016 [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Despite these achievements, malaria remains a major health burden, and the reductions in incidence and mortality have not been sustained. In fact, there was an 8% increase in malaria cases in Ghana in 2018 compared to 2017 [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>As in other settings, the effects of climatic variables and location on malaria transmission are well established in Ghana [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, social and economic factors affect the incidence of malaria in the country [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In terms of location, malaria prevalence varies significantly by region and tends to be higher in rural localities than in urban areas [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For instance, the Greater Accra Region had the lowest malaria prevalence (5%) among children under five years in the country in 2016, in contrast to the northern region (25%) and eastern and central regions (both with 31%) [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This heterogeneity is influenced by several factors such as the immune profile of populations, stability of mosquito breeding places (related to climate factors), varying density of populations, and accessibility to public health interventions and healthcare [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As a result, policies targeting malaria prevention and control need to be designed specifically for regional and local levels, utilizing local specific data rather than national-level aggregated data, which may not reflect disease distribution at the regional and local levels. The aim of this study was to assess the inter-district variation of malaria burden and the climatic drivers of malaria in the Greater Accra Region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-06080-f001">Figure 1</xref>), where malaria is among the top five infections reported at healthcare facilities [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], using spatio-temporal statistical and analytical techniques.</p>

                <p>The study was conducted in the Greater Accra Region, which includes the country’s capital city, Accra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-06080-f001">Figure 1</xref>). It is the smallest of the 16 administrative regions in Ghana. The area is about 3245 square kilometers. It is the second-most populated region in the country with a population of 5,055,765 in 2019 [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is divided into 29 local government areas (LGAs), namely: 1—Adenta Municipal, 2—Ledzokuku Municipa, 3—Ada East, 4—Shai Osudoku, 5—Ada West, 6—Ningo/Prampram, 7—La Dade-Kotopon, 8—La-Nkwantanang-Madina, 9—Ga East, 10—Ayawaso West, 11—Ga South Municipal, 12—Ga West Municipal, 13—Ga Central Municipal, 14—Tema West Municipal, 15—Ashaiman Municipal, 16—Kpone Katamanso, 17—Ablekuma Central Municipal, 18—Korle Klottey Municipal, 19—Ablekuma North Municipal, 20—Ayawaso North Municipal, 21—Ayawaso East Municipal, 22—Okaikwei North Municipal, 23—Ga North Municipal, 24—Weija Gbawe Municipal, 25—Krowor Municipal, 26—Tema Metropolitan, 27—Ablekuma West Municipal, 28—Ayawaso Central Municipal, and 29—Accra Metropolis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-06080-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Most of the LGAs are urban, and urban LGAs house more than 80% of the region’s residents [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The LGAs are classified as districts, municipalities, and metropolitan areas, with metropolitan areas being the most urban. However, for the purpose of this study, they are all referred to as districts. The blend of remote and urban communities within the region makes it a suitable site for this study. The climate of the area is categorized as tropical savannah with high humidity and high temperatures.</p>

                <p>A total of 1,105,370 malaria cases were recorded in the region during the study period (2015–2019). The overall malaria incidence was approximately 47 per 1000 population at risk. All districts recorded malaria cases during the study period. Malaria transmission was spatially heterogeneous across the study area, with Ashaiman district recording the highest number of cases (187,322, 16.9%) and Ayawaso West district the lowest (1739, 0.2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-06080-f002">Figure 2</xref>).

              <p>This study assessed the inter-district variation of malaria burden and the climatic drivers of malaria in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. Malaria incidence varied across the region and increased over the study period with a strong seasonal pattern. The significant covariate of malaria transmission was monthly minimum temperature without lag.</p>
              <p>The incidence of malaria was found to vary significantly between districts, with only five out of the 29 districts, located in the southcentral area, having a lower trend than the regional average trend. Additionally, less urbanized districts were found to be associated with more cases and higher disease risk compared to less urbanized districts. Previous studies have reported that lower incidence of malaria in more urban areas was related to greater social and economic development, including access to better housing and drainage systems as well as more accessible healthcare, resulting in decreased human vector contact and more active case management [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Populations in less urbanized areas are also more likely to be engaged in agricultural and other occupational activities, leading to more exposure to mosquitos, which breed in these areas [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This study also showed a strong relationship between population density and malaria incidence, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-06080-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Districts with lower population densities tended to be less urbanized and correlated with a higher malaria incidence. This could be due to a lower ratio of humans to vectors in these districts, resulting in an increased biting rate [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. </p>
              <p>There was a clear indication of seasonality and an irregular inter-annual pattern of malaria transmission in the Greater Accra Region; higher numbers of cases were recorded in the rainy seasons and in 2017 and 2019, respectively. A previous study by Donovan et al. [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which utilized clinical and self-reported malaria data, also found that malaria transmission increased during the rainy season in Accra. However, rainfall lagged at one month was not found to be statistically significant in predicting malaria cases in this study, contradicting findings from previous studies [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. For example, some studies found poor associations between malaria and rainfall [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], while others reported a strong negative association between malaria transmission and rainfall [<xref rid="B39-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. At the population level, lag effects are linked to factors affecting mosquito development and parasite incubation [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As such, features in urban areas, including open gutters and poor disposal of refuse, may provide breeding conditions conducive to mosquito survival and an increase in malaria risk. Additionally, wet seasons are usually associated with flooding and pooling of water. This, together with the few water bodies found in the environment, serve as breeding grounds for the malaria vector. These may have contributed significantly to the rise in malaria cases. However, the decreasing number of cases in 2016 and 2018 could be due to the protection offered from the mass distribution of LLIN in those years, but LLIN was not included in our model. </p>
              <p>The model results from this study showed that increasing monthly maximum temperature negatively correlated with malaria incidence. This association was not statistically significant (RR: 0.996, 95% CrI: 0.969–1.007). However, the effects of increasing temperature on vector populations, the incubation period of malaria parasites, and malaria transmission are well-known [<xref rid="B43-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Increasing temperature promotes malaria transmission rates and extends malaria geographically [<xref rid="B45-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Optimal temperature values from 23 °C to 31 °C usually favor malaria parasite development and vector survival, resulting in an increased malaria incidence [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Temperature values above the optimal range have negative effects on the malaria vector and parasite, leading to reduced malaria incidence. Additionally, there is general recognition of the relationship between lagged climatic variables and malaria incidence over time. For instance, in a systematic review by Reiner Jr. et al. [<xref rid="B47-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] on the seasonality of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> transmission, lagged temperature varying from zero month to nine months were observed to drive global malaria incidence significantly. Individual or a combined influence of factors, including habitat formation, vector development, infectivity, and emergence of signs and symptoms in humans during the lag’s periods, affects malaria transmission dynamics [<xref rid="B48-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p>
              <p>It is uncertain why an increase in minimum temperature was associated with reduced malaria incidence during the study period. Minimum temperature was also found to affect the transmission of malaria in previous studies [<xref rid="B51-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. One would expect an increase in minimum temperature to decrease the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], thereby, increasing malaria transmission. However, the complex interactions among vector, parasitic, behavioral, socioeconomic, and healthcare factors not included in the model may have contributed to the results observed.</p>
              <p>Findings from this study need to be interpreted with the consideration of some limitations. Firstly, district by district data were not available to measure and compare the availability, accessibility, and usage of malaria control and prevention strategies (LLIN, IPTp, IRS), which could have potentially influenced malaria transmission in the Greater Accra region. Hence, these factors were not included in the model. Secondly, the study used passive surveillance data, for which the quality and reliability could not be readily ascertained. Thirdly, unmeasured risk modifiers, including living standards and socio-economic development, treatment seeking behaviors, and population mobility, were not accounted for in this study. Lastly, consideration was not given to individuals who sought care in healthcare facilities outside their districts of residence because of personal preferences or proximity. The limitations discussed above were suggested to have influenced the pattern of diseases, including malaria transmission in previous studies [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B57-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. However, our results agree with prior studies on the relation between climate and malaria [<xref rid="B47-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Malaria transmission within the region may have been mediated by multiple factors apart from the climatic covariates assessed, including vector characteristics and environmental and human population dynamics [<xref rid="B48-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B50-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Hence, future studies should use methods that will explore both linear and non-linear relationships between climatic conditions and malaria incidence within the study region. </p>

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>Findings from this study showed a negative correlation between malaria and minimum temperature in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana from 2015 to 2019. Additionally, malaria transmission was heterogeneous across the districts and showed strong seasonal and inter-annual variations. The results reported in this study expand on knowledge regarding the influence of climatic factors on malaria transmission previously found in other parts of Ghana, sub–Saharan Africa, and other malaria endemic countries [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Our study also highlighted the variations in malaria incidence at a small geographical scale and shows the relevance of using modelling and geographical information systems methods to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of malaria transmission. It is also relevant to mention the interactions between malaria and COVID-19 in the current era. In resource constrained low- and middle-income countries, including Ghana, the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to undermine targeted malaria control efforts based on our findings because of overlapping symptoms, and because of diversion of limited public health resources from malaria control to COVID-19 response [<xref rid="B60-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-ijerph-18-06080" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Although the transmission pattern identified in our study could be influenced by other variables not considered, our findings showed that malaria is still a disease of great importance in Ghana. Hence, there is a need to continue with malaria control and prevention interventions alongside COVID-19 measures in general to ensure that the malaria situation does not worsen post COVID-19. Most importantly, malaria control measures should be intensified in the high-risk districts by increasing LLINs, IRS, and IPTp, especially during periods during which climatic variables assessed were identified to be associated with high malaria transmissions in the region. </p>
