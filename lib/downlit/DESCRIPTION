Description: Syntax highlighting of R code, specifically designed for the
    needs of 'RMarkdown' packages like 'pkgdown', 'hugodown', and
    'bookdown'. It includes linking of function calls to their
    documentation on the web, and automatic translation of ANSI escapes in
    output to the equivalent HTML.
