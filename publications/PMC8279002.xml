                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>COVID-19 initially caused less severe outbreaks in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) compared with many high-income countries, possibly because of differing demographics, socioeconomics, surveillance, and policy responses. Here, we investigate the role of multiple factors on COVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines, a LMIC that has had a relatively severe COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We applied an age-structured compartmental model that incorporated time-varying mobility, testing, and personal protective behaviors (through a “Minimum Health Standards” policy, MHS) to represent the first wave of the Philippines COVID-19 epidemic nationally and for three highly affected regions (Calabarzon, Central Visayas, and the National Capital Region). We estimated effects of control measures, key epidemiological parameters, and interventions.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Population age structure, contact rates, mobility, testing, and MHS were sufficient to explain the Philippines epidemic based on the good fit between modelled and reported cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. The model indicated that MHS reduced the probability of transmission per contact by 13-27%. The February 2021 case detection rate was estimated at ~8%, population recovered at ~9%, and scenario projections indicated high sensitivity to MHS adherence.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>COVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines are driven by age, contact structure, mobility, and MHS adherence. Continued compliance with low-cost MHS should help the Philippines control the epidemic until vaccines are widely distributed, but disease resurgence may be occurring due to a combination of low population immunity and detection rates and new variants of concern.</p>

                <p id="para0007">Evidence before this study</p>
                <p id="para0008">The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 188 countries with variable impacts across settings, and apparently less severe outbreaks initially in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) compared with many high income countries. Understanding the reasons for these differences is critical in determining how to ease restrictive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) without causing disease resurgence until vaccines are widely distributed. There are numerous factors that could drive these differences across countries, including population age structure, contact patterns, population density, seasonality, pre-existing exposure to other coronaviruses, comorbidities associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes, healthcare and testing capacity, and intervention policies. Previous studies suggest that in LMIC, any benefits from factors like younger populations (due to lower susceptibility and infectiousness) may be negated by factors such as limitations in surveillance and healthcare capacity. If true, NPI timing and stringency could be expected to explain differences in COVID-19 burden across income settings.</p>
                <p id="para0009">Added value of this study</p>
                <p id="para0010">We explored the extent to which age structure, contact patterns, changes in mobility and personal protective behaviors have driven the COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines using a compartmental model and considered scenarios for future disease burden with policy changes. The model indicated that COVID-19 epidemiology in the Philippines can be explained by age, contact structure, mobility, and adherence to public health policies. The Minimum Health Standards policy, which requires people to adopt a suite of personal protective behaviors, has played a substantial role in reducing transmission in the Philippines. However, low testing capacity, the limited proportion of the population recovered from infection (modelled), and high sensitivity to easing policies, are likely to be important factors in determining the potential for disease resurgence.</p>

                <p id="para0012">Age and contact structures likely drive the substantial differences in COVID-19 burdens across income settings, but low-cost interventions can limit disease burden further. While numerous demographic, political, and socioeconomic factors are hypothesised to affect disease transmission, the results of this study suggest that, prior to the introduction of variants of concern, the apparent lower burden of disease in the Philippines was driven by younger populations, contact structure, and policy. Using the Philippines as a case study, which experienced a relatively severe COVID-19 outbreak for a LMIC, we investigated the effectiveness of NPIs and personal protective behaviors in curtailing transmission and found that personal protective behaviors have likely reduced disease burden considerably. This study therefore provides evidence of a low-cost, effective intervention policy that could be adopted by other countries to prevent disease resurgence while vaccines are distributed.</p>

Multiple demographic and socioeconomic factors likely drive differential COVID-19 burden across income groups, both within and among countries.

While many LMIC have had lower COVID-19 burdens than HIC, weak surveillance systems<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> could also affect epidemic estimates. Nonetheless, understanding why many LMIC have had apparently less severe outbreaks could help other countries better control their epidemics until vaccines are widely distributed.</p>
              <p id="para0014">While there are now several highly efficacious vaccines to prevent severe disease<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>, and possibly infection<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>, from SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), widespread vaccination will take months to years<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> and will likely need to be coupled with effective non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>. For countries rolling out vaccines, easing NPIs too early could jeopardize success<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>. However, for the majority of the world's population, particularly those living in LMIC, vaccine access and delivery is limited<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and widespread vaccination coverage may take two or more years<xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref>. Thus, with or without vaccines, understanding the effectiveness of NPIs that can curtail COVID-19 transmission is critical. There are three broad categories of NPIs, those that aim to: (i) isolate infected individuals and their contacts; (ii) reduce contact between infected and susceptible people (henceforward “macrodistancing”); and (iii) reduce transmission given contact between infected and susceptible people (henceforward “microdistancing”). Most HIC have enforced initiatives for all three types of NPIs with a focus on long, strict macrodistancing interventions through stay-at-home orders. LMIC have also employed macrodistancing policies but often with shorter, less strict orders because these types of initiatives exacerbate poverty and have societal costs<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> that LMIC cannot withstand (although some LMIC like China enforced strict, short-term macrodistancing policies that led to successful disease suppression). Relaxing of short-term macrodistancing policies would be expected to lead to disease resurgence<xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref>, which runs counter to the experience of some LMIC. A meta-analysis indicates that inexpensive microdistancing policies (e.g., properly wearing face masks) can be highly effective<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> and therefore could explain why some LMIC are continuing to suppress transmission after an initial period of macrodistancing.</p>
              <p id="para0015">The Philippines is one of the most severely affected countries by COVID-19 in the Western Pacific Region<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Here we investigate COVID-19 epidemiology in the Philippines during the first wave of transmission and the effectiveness and sensitivity to microdistancing policies. The Philippines is a LMIC that, during the first epidemic wave, had over 580,000 confirmed cases and more than 12,000 deaths, with a peak in incidence in August 2020; at time of writing, the Philippines is undergoing a subsequent second, more severe wave of transmission that is not assessed in this study. Various NPIs have been implemented in the country, with the timing and level of restriction varying by region. The NPIs implemented include different levels of community quarantines, including school closures<xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref>. Between October 2020 and March 2021, the Philippines shifted from a focus on community quarantine orders towards greater reliance on Minimum Health Standards (MHS) policies, requiring the proper use of face coverings, physical distancing, and hand hygiene. To gain insights into the Philippines epidemic during the first wave of transmission, we present a data-driven COVID-19 model, which includes age structure, heterogeneous contact patterns, time-varying testing rates, and macro- and microdistancing. We use this model to 1) estimate epidemiological parameters for COVID-19 in the Philippines; 2) consider the effects of NPIs implemented during the first wave of transmission; and 3) create scenarios for various policy changes and estimate associated risk of disease resurgence.</p>

                <p id="para0016">We used several data sources from the Philippines to assess COVID-19 epidemiology at the national level and for three highly affected regions: Calabarzon (Region IV-A), Central Visayas (Region VII), and the National Capital Region (Metro Manila). For national and regional population data, we used the 2020 projected population distribution by age from the Philippines Statistics Authority (<xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>A, S4). To gain insight into the first wave of transmission in the Philippines, we used time series data from 1 March 2020 to 23 February 2021. We aggregated these data across all age groups (for data sources where age was available), because data were sparse for certain age groups and &gt;2000 records were missing age information. For number of tests, ICU occupancy, and deaths, we used daily data from the Republic of the Philippines Department of Health COVID-19 Data Drop (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doh.gov.ph/covid19tracker" id="interref0001">https://doh.gov.ph/covid19tracker</ext-link>). We aggregated test data from multiple laboratories (we list the laboratory facilities associated with each region in Table S6). For daily confirmed cases, we used the Department of Health COVID-19 Philippines Local Government Units Monitoring Platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fassster.ehealth.ph/covid19/" id="interref0002">https://fassster.ehealth.ph/covid19/</ext-link>). Lab facilities in the Philippines confirmed cases by RT-PCR and we calculated daily cases based on report date. To account for differences between weekday and weekend reporting, we smoothed daily confirmed cases using a seven day moving average. To quantify changing mobility patterns associated with NPIs, we used Google mobility data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/" id="interref0003">https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/</ext-link>).<fig id="fig0001"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Age-structured COVID-19 model informed with population size, contact rates, and mobility from the Philippines.

                <p id="para0017">We developed an age-structured deterministic compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission to model disease spread in the Philippines. We included six sequential compartments in the model representing susceptible, non-infectious exposed, infectious exposed, early actively infectious, late actively infectious, and recovered/removed persons (<xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>B, S1; <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and stratified the infectious compartments by detection status and disease severity (<xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>C, S2-3; we show differential equations in supplemental material).

To account for age-dependent processes, we stratified all model compartments by age group using 5-year age bands from birth to ≥75 years of age and allowed the proportion symptomatic, susceptibility to infection, infection fatality rate, and the probability of hospitalisation to differ by age group.

We simulated school closures by scaling school contribution according to the proportion of children attending schools under relevant policies. When schools closed, home contacts scaled up with residential Google mobility data, although in reality, scaling up home contacts beyond the average household size may not strongly affect transmission due to contact saturation (i.e., the ceiling effect of the limited number of potential contacts to infect within each household). In the Philippines, school closures started in mid-March 2020 in the most highly affected areas and schools remain closed throughout the country (as of 10th May 2021).</p>

We used three sources of local data as calibration targets: total daily confirmed cases and the most recent estimate of ICU occupancy and cumulative deaths (806 and 11523 respectively for the national model). Although we calibrated the model to these three targets simultaneously, we prioritized confirmed cases in the calibration process because these data are considered the highest quality in the Philippines for COVID-19 (based on advice from local health officials), while limiting the use of ICU and mortality data to the most recent values, as the quality of these data improved over time. We simultaneously fit the model to the three calibration targets using an adaptive Metropolis algorithm<xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> (<xref rid="tbl0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; supplemental material). For the prior distributions of epidemiological calibration parameters, we used uniform priors for highly uncertain quantities and truncated normal distributions for quantities informed by epidemiological evidence (<xref rid="tbl0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; supplemental material). To account for potential differences between HIC and LMIC, we included “adjuster” parameters to modify the proportion of symptomatic individuals, proportion of symptomatic individuals hospitalised, and the infection fatality rate (which are based on estimates from HIC). The adjuster values are multiplicative factors applied to the odds ratio, where an adjuster value of one would indicate no adjustment is needed, a value below one would indicate the parameter is lower in the Philippines, and a value above one would indicate the parameter is higher in the Philippines. To calibrate the model, we ran seven independent chains with approximately 10000 iterations per chain and discarded the first 200 iterations as burn-in. We evaluated convergence and autocorrelation through visual inspection of trace plots and autocorrelograms respectively, and calculated effective sample sizes. We used Latin Hypercube Sampling across the multidimensional parameter space to select initial parameter conditions. We structured the model, calibration data, likelihood function, and priors identically for the national and regional models.

                <p id="para0024">The model reproduced national and regional trends in confirmed cases, hospitalisations, and deaths when incorporating changes in movement and adherence to MHS. Prior to assessing model fit to data, we determined that the model converged by visually assessing trace plots (e.g., Fig S5 for parameters in the national model) and calculated effective sample sizes of 1170 for the national model, 869 for Calabarzon, 1139 for Central Visayas, and 1513 for the National Capital Region. The model fit was considerably better with the inclusion of both community quarantine-adjusted movement and adherence to MHS compared with a counterfactual scenario that only included community quarantines (<xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>, S6-8). These results suggest that if MHS had not been implemented, there would have been twelve times as many cases at the August 2020 outbreak peak. The four calibrated models (national and three regional models) show reasonably good fits to total confirmed cases (<xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Additionally, the distributions are similar for modelled and confirmed cumulative cases by age group, with very close correspondence for those aged 40 years and above, but underpredictions for those aged 25-39 and overpredictions for ages 19 and below (Fig. S9). The models slightly overpredict reported cumulative deaths and ICU occupancy (except for the National Capital Region) (<xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>, S10-12). We estimated the proportion of the population recovered by the end of the first wave of transmission as approximately 9% (95% CI = 4-31%) as of 26th February 2021 (<xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).<fig id="fig0002"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Model reproduced daily confirmed case count better with the inclusion of Minimum Health Standards (MHS).

We incorporated parameters to adjust the proportion of symptomatic individuals, the proportion of symptomatic individuals hospitalised, and the infection fatality rate from the baseline values and estimated all three adjuster parameters had broad distributions overlapping one, indicating that the process of fitting to data did not provide information on the adjustments needed to these quantities. The maximum effect of MHS was estimated at around 0.20 (95% CI = 0.12 - 0.27) with a tight posterior distribution (Fig. S13), suggesting that MHS has reduced the risk of transmission per contact by about 20%. The model case detection was estimated at approximately 2 to 15% in the Philippines (Fig. S14), although the posterior distribution of this value was broad (Fig. S13).</p>

                <p id="para0026">We projected transmission in the near term under a range of possible scenarios and show that, prior to the second epidemic wave, epidemic trajectories were highly sensitive to compliance with MHS. Moreover, allowing home workers to return onsite while maintaining MHS was estimated to have limited impact on detected cases (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>, S15-17), as well as overall incidence, hospital occupancy, and mortality (although the projections did not account for potentially increased transmission within contained spaces during the work week). If current conditions were carried forward, transmission was projected to continue at low levels and therefore would not overwhelm hospital capacity or lead to excessive deaths. Allowing students to return to school was estimated to result in a considerable increase in cases (although this result varied markedly by region, Figs. S15-17). Reducing the effectiveness of MHS by 50% was projected to lead to a steady increase in burden, whereas reducing the effectiveness of MHS by 70% or 100% was projected to lead to a major resurgence in cases, associated hospitalisations, and deaths.<fig id="fig0005"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Epidemic scenario projections for detected cases from the Philippines national model, showing high sensitivity to compliance with the Minimum Health Standards (MHS).

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="para0027">The combination of younger age distributions, more intergenerational contacts, changes in mobility, and changes in personal protective behaviors, appear to explain why the Philippines sustained a relatively less severe COVID-19 outbreak than many high income countries (HIC), prior to the introduction of variants of concern<xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref>. Younger populations typical of LMIC may reduce disease burden in two ways: 1) a proportionally smaller percent of the population is elderly (compared with HIC) and at highest risk of severe disease and mortality from COVID-19<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>; and 2) those who survive to old age are often of higher socioeconomic status and may have a disproportionately lower infection risk compared with the general population<xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref>. More intergenerational contacts in LMIC may also lower disease burden because elderly people often reside with family rather than in aged-care facilities, which have driven outbreak clusters in many HIC (e.g., <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>). An important finding of this study is that adherence to MHS appeared largely responsible for limiting transmission in the Philippines while gradually easing quarantines during the first epidemic wave. These results were consistent across regions (i.e., all models presented in this paper) that span a wide population density gradient, suggesting that this approach is effective in both rural and urban areas and could also be effective in other similar settings. It is possible that the effect of MHS is a surrogate for other time-varying processes, however, local experts within the Philippines provide strong intuition that MHS is responsible for driving the patterns we found. In addition, we are not aware of any other processes than those modelled that could be responsible for these patterns. These types of personal protective measures will likely continue to be needed throughout 2021 and potentially 2022, depending on the speed of vaccine distribution.</p>
              <p id="para0028">Current transmission trends in the Philippines (as of 10th May 2021) indicate that the country is in the middle of a second, larger wave of transmission and sustained disease spread remains a major threat until vaccines are widely distributed. Local expert opinion suggests the second wave is mainly occurring in the National Capital Region and parts of Calabarzon and are driven by new variants of concern<xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref>, which are more transmissible and lethal<xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref>. Further, increases in mobility, due to relaxed inter-zonal travel requirements, and lower compliance to MHS (which could be attributable to over-confidence in disease control and fatigue with personal protective behaviors), provides more transmission opportunities. The results of this study provided real-time weekly updates of the model outputs through the first wave directly to policy-makers through the Department of Health COVID-19 Philippines Local Government Units Monitoring Platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fassster.ehealth.ph/covid19/" id="interref0004">https://fassster.ehealth.ph/covid19/</ext-link>) and indicated that, in the absence of new variants, relaxing societal restrictions like work-from-home orders were not predicted to cause substantial disease resurgence. At the same time, low case detection (2-15%) and percentage recovered (modelled at &lt;31%) and high sensitivity to maintaining MHS indicated that disease resurgence remained a major threat. Thus, prior to the introduction of disease variants, MHS may have been sufficient to sustain suppression of transmission as a bridge to broad scale vaccination. Although not modelled in this study, the increased transmissibility of the new variants may be broadly comparable to the reduction in transmission gained by MHS adherence. Therefore, these measures may no longer be sufficient to suppress transmission as strain replacement occurs, although they would still help alleviate burden on the health care system. Recent disease resurgence in the Philippines demonstrates the need for sustained non-pharmaceutical interventions until vaccines are widely distributed. Limited testing is another major obstacle for the Philippines<xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> and many other LMIC and can hinder both public health response and our understanding of the epidemic.</p>
              <p id="para0029">There are several important limitations relevant to interpreting the model results, including modelling assumptions, data limitations, and uncertainty. Most epidemiological parameters for COVID-19 used in this study were estimated from HIC (or China). While we included “adjuster” parameters to allow the symptomatic proportion, hospitalisation, and mortality rates to vary for the Philippines (similar to <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>), these parameters were not well constrained by the data. We assumed that other parameters were similar to HIC, which may be inaccurate. However, most parameter estimates appear reasonable given previously reported COVID-19 epidemiology in the Philippines<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref>. When more data become available from the Philippines or similar settings, the current model can be updated with new parameter values. Data issues made modelling and understanding the epidemic in the Philippines particularly challenging, although data quality has progressively improved through time. For example, additional ICU facilities were created specifically for COVID-19 in the Philippines and were not required to report usage, likely affecting these estimates, especially early in the epidemic. Similarly, daily deaths, which are often considered the most reliable epidemic indicator internationally, have fluctuated markedly over the course of the epidemic, often peaking at times that appear contradictory to patterns of confirmed cases. Although reporting of daily deaths appears unreliable, cumulative deaths align reasonably well with the model projections of mortality without significant modification to the internationally estimated infection fatality rate. Finally, there is uncertainty around all model parameters, with some parameters less well constrained than others (e.g., case detection rate), which highlights the need for more epidemiological information. Future studies could build on this effort by including new, more robust data sources for model parameters and calibration targets.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSION</title>
              <p id="para0030">One of the most critical issues facing countries around the world is determining the best strategy for ending COVID-19 transmission through the combined use of vaccines and non-pharmaceutical interventions. More than 188 countries have been affected by COVID-19 with apparently less severe impacts in many LMIC compared with HIC. Our results suggest that COVID-19 epidemiology in the Philippines can be explained by differences in age, contact structures, and policy, with MHS playing a substantial role in mitigating the initial outbreak. The Philippines has experienced one of the largest outbreaks of COVID-19 in the Western Pacific Region but also provides an approach that could help other countries relax interventions more safely, which remains an important strategy for countries with limited access to vaccines.</p>
