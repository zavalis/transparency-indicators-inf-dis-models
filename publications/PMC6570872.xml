                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne arbovirus that can produce serious public health consequences. In 2016, ZIKV caused an epidemic in many countries around the world, including the United States. ZIKV surveillance and vector control is essential to combating future epidemics. However, challenges relating to the timely publication of case reports significantly limit the effectiveness of current surveillance methods. In many countries with poor infrastructure, established systems for case reporting often do not exist. Previous studies investigating the H1N1 pandemic, general influenza and the recent Ebola outbreak have demonstrated that time- and geo-tagged Twitter data, which is immediately available, can be utilized to overcome these limitations.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">In this study, we employed a recently developed system called Cloudberry to filter a random sample of Twitter data to investigate the feasibility of using such data for ZIKV epidemic tracking on a national and state (Florida) level. Two auto-regressive models were calibrated using weekly ZIKV case counts and <italic>zika</italic> tweets in order to estimate weekly ZIKV cases 1 week in advance.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">While models tended to over-predict at low case counts and under-predict at extreme high counts, a comparison of predicted versus observed weekly ZIKV case counts following model calibration demonstrated overall reasonable predictive accuracy, with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.74 for the Florida model and 0.70 for the U.S. model. Time-series analysis of predicted and observed ZIKV cases following internal cross-validation exhibited very similar patterns, demonstrating reasonable model performance. Spatially, the distribution of cumulative ZIKV case counts (local- &amp; travel-related) and <italic>zika</italic> tweets across all 50 U.S. states showed a high correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.73) after adjusting for population.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">This study demonstrates the value of utilizing Twitter data for the purposes of disease surveillance. This is of high value to epidemiologist and public health officials charged with protecting the public during future outbreaks.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par11">Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne arbovirus that causes serious public health consequences. Zika virus is primarily transmitted to people through the bite of an infected <italic>Aedes</italic> species mosquito (<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although most infections carry mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, the association between ZIKV and microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome placed ZIKV as a global medical emergency during the 2016 epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Currently there is no medicine or vaccine to cure or prevent ZIKV infection. Therefore, infection containment, vector control and personal protection are the most important measures to prevent infections and contain viral spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ZIKV has been reported in over 60 countries and territories worldwide, during the 2015–2016 ZIKV epidemic, with South America as the most severely affected continent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the United States, locally acquired ZIKV cases have been reported in Florida and Texas as well as the U.S. territories in Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Travel-associated U.S. cases of ZIKV infections have been reported in all 50 States in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. ZIKV can also be sexually transmitted, which suggests concern for potential local outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. By November, 2016, U.S. travel-associated ZIKV cases amounted to 4115. By this time, there were 139 locally acquired mosquito-borne and 35 sexually transmitted cases in the U.S. Cases in U.S. territories amounted to 39,951 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although there were no reports of microcephaly cases, 13 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome were reported in the continental U.S., and 50 in U.S. territories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">Regarding ZIKV surveillance and vector control, challenges exist that have significantly limited the effectiveness of current methods. In the United States, disease surveillance is supported by the CDC Division of Health Informatics and Surveillance and is carried out through a variety of networks that involve the collaboration of thousands of agencies at the federal, state, territorial, and tribal levels across health departments, laboratories, and hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Importantly, while ZIKV cases reported from official sources such as the CDC are of high quality, such reporting is not timely due to an internal protocol of these offices to collect and verify data prior to formal publication. In addition, the cases reported by any single source do not always reflect all the cases that truly exist. More importantly, in many countries or regions with poor infrastructure and healthcare systems, established systems for such case reporting do not exist. To collect as much ZIKV case information as possible with minimal delay, other services are available that can publish such information more timely.</p>
              <p id="Par14">Alternative data sources such as social media and other digital services provide an opportunity to overcome existing surveillance obstacles by providing relevant information that is temporally and geographically tagged. To date, the variety of digital data streams that have been utilized to help track diseases over time and space have included internet search engines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], electronic health records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], news reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], Twitter posts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], satellite imagery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], clinicians’ search engines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and crowd-sourced participatory disease surveillance systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">In terms of social media data streams, Twitter is a free social networking service that enables millions of users to send and read one another’s brief messages, or “tweets,” each day. Tweets can be posted either publicly or internally within groups of “followers.” Currently, this service includes approximately 326 million registered users, with 67 million in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In spite of a fair amount of noise due to general chatter and the sheer number of tweets, Twitter contains useful information that can be utilized for disease surveillance and forecasting.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Previously, Twitter has been utilized to measure public anxiety related to stock market prices, national sentiment, and the impacts of earthquakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. More recently, Twitter was used in epidemic tracking and forecasting for the H1N1 pandemic, general influenza, and the recent Ebola outbreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In terms of ZIKV, studies have made use of Twitter data and developed predictive models for a variety of applications. Mandal et al. (2018) developed Twitter-based models to track zika prevention techniques and help inform health care officials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Other studies have performed content analysis of Twitter data to explore and predict what types of zika-related discussions people were having during the recent ZIKV epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">Since ZIKV outbreaks are influenced by many environmental and social factors, such as local mosquito species and density distributions, season, climate, land use, land cover, human demographics, and mitigation efforts, successful surveillance and forecasting of the disease can be difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Use of live streaming ZIKV-related information via nationwide tweets could represent a practical, timely, and effective surveillance tool, in turn improving ZIKV case detection and outbreak forecasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. To date, however, studies making use of Twitter data to monitor the spread of ZIKV in real time and space have been limited.</p>
              <p id="Par18">In one study, Teng et al. (2017) developed models to forecast cumulative ZIKV cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, these models were developed to predict ZIKV cases cumulatively, and on a global basis. Further, these studies did not make use of the Twitter data stream, but rather Google Trends. Similarly, Majumder et al. (2016) developed models to forecast ZIKV case counts in Columbia during the recent ZIKV epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Again, however, the analysis utilized Google Trends data and considered cumulative, rather than weekly, case counts. In our research, we identified only a single study that attempted to forecast ZIKV using the Twitter data steam, and on a weekly basis. In this study by McGough et al. (2017), the authors demonstrated the utility of developing Twitter-based models to forecast ZIKV in countries of South America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, given the lack of robust diagnostic capabilities in the region, the study was limited to using “suspected,” rather than “confirmed,” ZIKV cases. Additionally, the study did not examine spatial patterns of ZIKV cases and tweets, nor did it compare local- versus national-level modeling. To the best of our knowledge, there has been only a single study to date to harness digital data streams for near-real time weekly forecasting of ZIKV cases, and no such study to date that has utilized Twitter data for ZIKV forecasting in the United States and offered a comparison of national- and state-level models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">In this study, we demonstrate the value of utilizing time- and geo-tagged information embedded in the Twitter data stream to 1) examine the relationship between weekly ZIKV cases and ZIKV-related tweets temporally and spatially, 2) assess whether Twitter data can be used to predict weekly ZIKV cases and, if so, 3) develop weekly ZIKV predicative models that can be used for early warning purposes on a state and national level. This study contributes to the body of literature.</p>

                <p id="Par20">We utilized a general-purpose system called Cloudberry to filter a 1% random sample of U.S. Twitter data. Cloudberry is a subscription client of the Twitter stream application program interface (API). It is connected to the big data management system Apache AsterixDB, which allows for the efficient transformation of front-end data requests, and the continuous ingest and storage of data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In the Cloudberry system, the geographic location filtering parameters are set by a rectangular bounding box that includes all U.S. territory. Since this boundary box also covers Canada and parts of Mexico, tweets that are not published in the U.S. are deleted. Cloudberry enables interactive analytics and visualizations of large amounts of data containing temporal, spatial, and textual components common to Twitter and other social media applications. Data collection from Cloudberry began on November 17, 2015, with approximately one million tweets stored per day, and over 874 million tweets collected so far. The Cloudberry system enables the filtration of millions of tweets according to specific parameters set by the API user.</p>
                <p id="Par21">Live tweet counts from Cloudberry were collected using Twitter’s open streaming API, which has been shown to be representative of Twitter’s greater information database and therefore useful for research purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The Streaming API can take three parameters; namely, keywords (words, phrases, or hashtags), geographical boundary boxes, and user ID. For the first two parameters, in order to identify and compile tweets that were relevant to ZIKV, we filtered data for the entire U.S. and for Florida during the year 2016 using the keywords <italic>zika</italic> and <italic>mosquito</italic>. The latter keyword was employed to explore whether it could provide an early warning signal of impending ZIKV activity. For the third parameter, no user ID was specified so as not to restrict sample size. Tweet counts were summed by week in order to be used in weekly prediction models. In using Twitter data for this study, we complied with Twitter’s terms, conditions, and privacy policies.</p>

Data was obtained using the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports maintained by the CDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. For cumulative state-by-state ZIKV prevalence data, we accessed an updated CDC online report on January 24, 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

                <p id="Par23">The Florida Department of Health reports only cumulative case counts.

To assess the potential lag in time between ZIKV cases and each tweet keyword, we examined the change in these coefficients after applying lags ranging from 0 to 6 weeks.

For this analysis, cases and tweets for each state were calculated as the sum of cases and tweets from January 1, 2016 through January 24, 2017. Cases were depicted as raw case counts. However, for proper spatial comparison, cumulative tweets were adjusted according to state population, using 2016 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Therefore, tweets per 100,000 people were reported, and referred to as tweet prevalence. Cumulative data was calculated through January 24, 2017 because the CDC only provides cumulative state-by-state ZIKV prevalence data for the date that data is accessed, not historically. That is, the CDC maintains an online report that is updated each week, at which point historical numbers are no longer available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In our case, we accessed the CDC website on January 24, 2017. This additional 24 day period is unlikely to have impacted our analysis as the ZIKV epidemic had dramatically slowed by this point, adding relatively few additional cases.</p>

This was to assess the potential utility of using Twitter data where quantitative ZIKV case reporting is not reliable, as well as to understand the extent to which each term alone is predictive of future case counts.</p>
                  <p id="Par27">Next, prediction models combining both prior ZIKV case counts and Twitter data to estimate weekly ZIKV case counts were explored. Specifically, we applied an auto-regressive (AR) model using <italic>zika</italic> tweet counts as an input series. Two types of covariates were used; namely, prior weekly ZIKV case counts and prior weekly <italic>zika</italic> tweet counts. Prior to model development, first-order differencing was applied to both dependent and independent variables. This is standard practice to address the issue of stationarity that is common to time-series data. After differencing, we examined various models using 1–6 week lags [AR(1,1)-AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]] for both the auto-regressive variable as well as the tweet variable according to the following general equation:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

                  <p id="Par28">In order to select an appropriate predictive model for Florida and a model for the U.S., several steps were taken. First, candidate models were identified.

                  <p id="Par29">In testing models, two highly inflated weekly <italic>zika</italic> tweet counts that occurred well before the major onset of the ZIKV epidemic, and which could be explained by high profile media events, were reduced to the mean of their before and after values.

Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared a ZIKV public health emergency of international concern that same week (Feb. 1) followed by an announced request by President Obama the following week (Feb. 8) for $1.8 billion in ZIKV-related emergency funds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

The predicted and measured values for these aggregated datasets were then plotted in the form of two scatter plots (one for the Florida model and one for the U.S. model) as well as two time-series plots.

As shown, the pattern of case reports and tweets was very similar, exhibiting a gradual increase in both tweets and cases during the spring months, with a prominent peak occurring during summer months. An increase of ZIKV cases during summer months is consistent with the primary mode of ZIKV transmission, namely mosquito bites, since mosquitoes are more prevalent in warmer, humid conditions. After the summer months, tweets and cases both declined. A prominent spike in <italic>zika</italic> tweets that did not coincide with ZIKV cases was apparent in the first half of February.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par46">Weekly ZIKV case reports and <italic>zika</italic> tweets in the U.S. and in Florida exhibited very similar temporal patterns, peaking during summer and declining in fall. A multivariate auto-regression analysis using Florida and U.S. data demonstrated <italic>zika</italic> tweets to be an important predictor of weekly ZIKV case counts during the 2016 study period. Combined with information of previous ZIKV case counts, we calibrated two models that were able to estimate weekly ZIKV cases 1 week in advance with reasonable accuracy; one model for Florida and one model for the U.S. Both models performed best when both prior ZIKV case count data and Twitter data were included. Following calibration of the models, and subsequent internal cross-validation, a comparison of predicted versus observed weekly ZIKV case counts demonstrated reasonable model performance for the Florida model and reduced, but still moderate, performance for the national model. A time-series plot of predicted and observed case counts similarly showed the Florida model to predict reasonably well and the national model to predict moderately well. While a comparison of observed and model-predicted ZIKV case counts produces R<sup>2</sup> values ≥0.70 for the Florida model, we must be careful not to overstate the model performance given that disease forecasting models can sometimes yield R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.9. Nonetheless, results for both models in this study suggest that Twitter data can be used to help track ZIKV prevalence during outbreak periods. Given that Twitter data is immediately available, compared to a delay of cases often reported by the CDC, Twitter represents a particularly useful tool for epidemiologist and public health officials involved in disease surveillance.</p>
              <p id="Par47">During model development, 1 week lagged <italic>zika</italic> tweets were best correlated with weekly ZIKV cases. This is visually apparent during the major outbreak period in Florida, where a sharp rise in <italic>zika</italic> tweets appeared to precede ZIKV cases by 1 week. A possible explanation is that an inherent temporal difference exists between Twitter chatter and ZIKV diagnosis. For instance, it is plausible that discussion of ZIKV (potentially due to the presence of symptomatic or hospitalized family members or friends) predates actual diagnosis. In this case, a rise in <italic>zika</italic> tweets would predict a rise in ZIKV cases. Whether or not this temporal difference in <italic>zika</italic> tweets is truly reflecting chatter related to the impending rise in ZIKV cases, however, cannot be confirmed here.</p>
              <p id="Par48">It is worth noting that reports of the first locally acquired ZIKV in Florida corresponded with the sharp rise in <italic>zika</italic> tweets occurring in August. Therefore, an alternative explanation is that the initial sharp rise in <italic>zika</italic> tweets occurring in summer could reflect chatter related to the first few cases of locally acquired ZIKV, rather than the impending increase in total ZIKV cases that occurred the following week. This explanation, however, fails to explain the overall higher correlation between ZIKV case counts and 1 week lagged <italic>zika</italic> tweets over the entire study period.</p>
              <p id="Par49">The primary strength of these models is the use of readily available, real-time Twitter data to estimate ZIKV cases. Additionally, the use of 1 week old ZIKV case reports to generate a good estimate means reduced dependence on the timely publication of case reports by government agencies in order to track ZIKV and predict outbreak trends. Where states report case counts on a daily basis during an outbreak (e.G. <italic>Florida</italic>), estimates of the following week’s ZIKV case counts can similarly be updated on a real-time (daily) basis. This enables better epidemic preparedness by local and state public health agencies in charge of disease response.</p>
              <p id="Par50">A primary limitation of these models is the need for historical ZIKV case count information. This requires the government to continue monitoring and publishing case reports. Though such surveillance takes place in the U.S. and other industrialized nations, it does not take place in many developing countries. Furthermore, government data may not always be released in time to enable ZIKV case predictions. In such regions where quantitative case count data is not accurately and/or consistently reported, or potentially delayed, univariate analyses using only prior <italic>zika</italic> tweets demonstrated that Twitter data may still be useful for disease surveillance. This assumes that Twitter is used among the local population and that sufficient knowledge of the disease and disease activity exists among the population.</p>
              <p id="Par51">Also noteworthy, since these are statistical models that depend on previous case reports, they cannot be used to predict a ZIKV outbreak where no prior case reports exist. Additionally, given their dependence on historical trends, these models are limited in their ability to predict historically anomalous events that could give rise to dramatic changes in disease prevalence. To this end, mechanistic models that take into account meteorology, vector distribution, population distribution and movement would provide more insight. Also, a diagnosis issue related to the cross-reactivity of diagnostic assays with other arboviruses presents a unique challenge for ZIKV surveillance. This challenge exists with traditional surveillance methods and is still an issue using our modeling approach.</p>
              <p id="Par52">Residuals plots for our models exhibited a departure from normality, with models tending to over-predict at low case count values and under-predict at high case counts. The models’ capability in predicting the full range of cases is compromised because of its over-prediction at extremely low values and under-prediction at extremely high values. Although this tendency toward extreme value prediction is quite common in statistical predictive models trained based on a limited number of measurement data, it nonetheless represents a limitation in this type of statistical modeling that needs to be acknowledged.</p>
              <p id="Par53">Importantly, this work presents predictive models designed with the goal of using covariates to forecast an outcome variable; namely, ZIKV cases. This is distinct from explanatory modeling, which seeks to understand the causal relationships between covariates and outcome variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. In this study, we do not pursue such causal inference. Therefore, while <italic>zika</italic> tweets serve useful in predicting ZIKV cases, we do not make claims about the relationship between tweets and ZIKV cases.</p>
              <p id="Par54">Understanding why <italic>zika</italic> tweets correlate well with ZIKV case counts and therefore offer utility as a surveillance tool is an interesting question. It is possible that <italic>zika</italic> tweets are capturing tweets related to first-hand illness, or that such tweets are merely capturing ZIKV awareness, or a combination of both. While this is an area of active research, the lack of a complete understanding of this relationship does not prevent <italic>zika</italic> tweets from serving as a useful predictor variable in the development of ZIKV forecasting models.</p>
              <p id="Par55">In discussing this study, it is important to avoid ‘big data hubris’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. That is, while our models demonstrate the ability of Twitter data to serve as an indicator of disease activity, such data should not be viewed as a substitute for traditional data collection and analysis, but rather a supplement to such traditional approaches. In future work, combining Twitter data with traditionally collected data related to vector population density, vaccine injection, transmissibility, and basic reproductive number would be useful to incorporate into modeling efforts.</p>
              <p id="Par56">A prominent, temporary spike in tweets that did not coincide with ZIKV cases occurred in early February. This was visible in total U.S. data and Florida data. Such a spike was months ahead of actual major ZIKV activity in the U.S. and can be explained by several important media-related occurrences. This time period marked the occurrence of the first cases of ZIKV to be reported in the United States by the CDC (week of Jan. 30). Of additional relevance was the WHO having declared a ZIKV public health emergency of international concern (Feb. 1) and President Obama announcing a request for $1.8 billion in ZIKV-related emergency funds the following week (Feb. 8). This was a very high profile week for ZIKV in terms of media attention. The inflation of such tweets by these respective events was reflected in actual Twitter content. A qualitative content analysis of trending ZIKV-related topics during this time period supported the existence of particular concern among the population over the arrival of ZIKV to the U.S., showing an overwhelming prevalence of such tweets as “Zika Health Emergency,” “Zika Virus is in the US!,” and “Great, Zika cases here.” Additionally, tweets that included “#CDC” were 2–4 times higher during the period when these events took place than during any week over the following 3 month period. Since these instances of media-related tweet inflation were infrequent, they did not appear to impact our predictive models. In using Twitter data for disease surveillance in the future it is nonetheless important for researchers to be mindful of the influence such major media headlines can have on tweet count, so as not to infer disease.</p>
              <p id="Par57">Two other points of deviation between tweet counts and ZIKV cases occurred during the months of November and December. In these cases, ZIKV cases increased sharply without corresponding increases in <italic>zika</italic> tweets. A possible explanation for this is the announced ending of the ZIKV public health emergency on November 18th by the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. This announcement potentially relieved public concern of ZIKV, which may have in turn depressed <italic>zika</italic> tweets in the weeks following.</p>
              <p id="Par58">When comparing national versus Florida ZIKV cases and tweets, time-series analyses showed national tweets to increase more dramatically during the major outbreak period, responding less to weekly vicissitudes in case counts (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Although this could suggest the potential for over-prediction of ZIKV cases for a national-based model, application of a U.S. model showed this to not be an issue. However, false prediction and timing of high ZIKV activity periods were apparent issues in the national model. That U.S. tweet counts responded less sensitively to ZIKV case counts, and that the U.S. model did not perform as well as the Florida model, makes sense given the higher spatial coverage of the entire U.S. relative to ZIKV hotspot regions (e.g. FL, CA, NY, and TX).</p>
              <p id="Par59">The keyword <italic>mosquito</italic> was also examined for its potential to serve as an early signal of locally acquired ZIKV, given that a rise in mosquitoes (the primary ZIKV vector) would expectedly lead to a rise in ZIKV. This keyword, however, provided no added benefit over use of the keyword <italic>zika</italic>. Rather, <italic>zika</italic> and <italic>mosquito</italic> tweets were tightly correlated throughout the entire year.</p>
              <p id="Par60">In general, the increase of ZIKV in the summer and subsequent decrease in the fall season can be explained by higher temperatures and humidity during summer months, which provides conditions ideal for mosquito breeding, as well as increased person travel. Additionally, pesticide spraying campaigns during the height of the outbreak, particularly in late summer, may have helped to control mosquito populations and prevent the spread of ZIKV. For instance, aerial spraying of the organophosphate pesticide Naled was conducted in Miami-Dade County, Florida, multiple times in September in order to combat ZIKV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In addition to dropping temperatures in the fall, this was another likely contributor to the sharp decrease in ZIKV cases and related tweets during this season.</p>
              <p id="Par61">In terms of spatial distribution across the U.S., ZIKV case reports were highly correlated with population-adjusted <italic>zika</italic> tweets. States with the most ZIKV cases also had the highest <italic>zika</italic> tweet prevalence while states with the fewest cases had the lowest tweet prevalence. This suggests that in addition to temporal accuracy, Twitter data may be a useful tool for predicting disease prevalence spatially. Additionally, this reinforces the potential utility of using Twitter data for ZIKV disease surveillance at the national level.</p>
              <p id="Par62">More research is necessary to identify an appropriate national-level predictive model. Additionally, future modeling efforts should attempt to separate tweets indicating awareness from tweets indicating infection. This could be accomplished by conducting a detailed content analysis of <italic>zika</italic> tweets. For instance, researchers could assemble a list of keywords or phrases in order to filter out non-infection related <italic>zika</italic> tweets. Once validated, this approach would produce a new time-series dataset of <italic>zika</italic> tweet counts that could be used to calibrate a new predictive model of ZIKV case counts. This approach would enable us to understand the underlying relationships between tweets and case counts. Lastly, calibration of other state-wide models for comparison with our Florida model is a worthwhile area of future research in order to understand how the relationship between Twitter data and disease incidence might vary from state-to-state, and to better utilize such data for predictive purposes in other regions.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par63"><italic>Zika</italic> tweets exhibited a very similar temporal pattern as ZIKV case counts in the U.S. during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic. An auto-regression analysis using data from Florida showed <italic>zika</italic> tweets to be a significant predictor of ZIKV cases, with model evaluation demonstrating that weekly ZIKV case counts could be predicted 1 week in advance with reasonable accuracy. By comparison, a nationally calibrated model showed reduced, but still moderate predictive ability. Model performance was improved for both models with the inclusion of prior ZIKV case count data, as opposed to just Twitter data. This study suggests that Twitter data can serve to signal changes in disease activity during an outbreak period. Additionally, spatial mapping of ZIKV and <italic>zika</italic> tweets across the U.S. showed similar patterns. States with the most ZIKV cases had the highest <italic>zika</italic> tweet prevalence while states with the fewest cases had the lowest tweet prevalence, indicating that spatial ZIKV predictive modeling may be possible at the national level.</p>

A very similar pattern in tweet frequency exists between the keywords <italic>zika</italic> and <italic>mosquito</italic>. Use of the keyword <italic>mosquito</italic> therefore provided no added benefit as a temporal indicator of ZIKV compared to the keyword <italic>zika</italic>. In terms of model selection, AIC values for various candidate models as well as univariate models for Florida and the U.S. are presented. Zero mean test results are also shown, suggesting that we can reject the null hypothesis that a unit root exists. Diagnostic results for the Florida and U.S. predictive models include an assessment of white noise, normality of residuals, heteroscedasticity, and partial auto-correlation (PACF). The white noise assessments indicate that more complex models were not necessary, while residuals plots assessing normality and heteroscedasticity of residuals suggest that residuals were not normally distributed for either model. In general, our models tended to over-predict at low case count values and under-predict at high case counts, thus suggesting a limitation of our models. PACF analyses support our choice as it relates to the number of lag terms used for the Florida model and the U.S. model. (DOCX 456 kb)</p>
