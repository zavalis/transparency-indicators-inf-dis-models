              <abstract>
                <p>The transmission dynamics of the coronavirus—COVID-19—have challenged humankind at almost every level. Currently, research groups around the globe are trying to figure out such transmission dynamics under special conditions such as separation policies enforced by governments. Mathematical and computational models, like the compartmental model or the agent-based model, are being used for this purpose. This paper proposes an agent-based model, called INFEKTA, for simulating the transmission of infectious diseases, not only the COVID-19, under social distancing policies. INFEKTA combines the transmission dynamic of a specific disease, (according to parameters found in the literature) with demographic information (population density, age, and genre of individuals) of geopolitical regions of the real town or city under study. Agents (virtual persons) can move, according to its mobility routines and the enforced social distancing policy, on a complex network of accessible places defined over an Euclidean space representing the town or city. The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 under different social distancing policies in Bogotá city, the capital of Colombia, is simulated using INFEKTA with one million virtual persons. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of social distancing policies indicates that it is possible to establish a ‘medium’ (i.e., close 40% of the places) social distancing policy to achieve a significant reduction in the disease transmission.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Infectious diseases have a substantial impact on public health, health care, macroeconomics, and society. The availability of options to control and prevent the emergence, expansion, or resurgence of pathogens warrants continuous evaluation using different methods. Mathematical models allow characterizing both the behavior and the emergent properties of biological systems, such as the transmission of infectious disease. [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Many biological systems have been modeled in terms of complex systems since their collective behavior cannot be simply inferred from the understanding of their components [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245787.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Computer-based algorithms are used to model properties and dynamic interactions between agents (e.g. persons, cells) or groups of agents within, and across levels of influence in complex systems [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245787.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In general, agent-based modeling (ABM) can be used for testing theories about underlying interaction mechanics among the system’s components and their resulting dynamics. It can be done by relaxing assumptions and/or altering the interaction mechanisms at the individual agent level. ABMs can increase our understanding of the mechanisms of complex dynamic systems, and the results of the simulations may be used for estimating future scenarios [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>In the past, ABMs have been employed to address various infectious diseases such as, a bioterrorist introduction of smallpox [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], control of tuberculosis [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], implementation of distancing measures and antiviral prophylaxis to control H5N1 influenza A (bird flu) [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], design of vaccination strategies for influenza [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], devise evacuation strategies in the event of airborne contamination [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and curtail transmission of measles through contact tracing and quarantine [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In our literature review, some other novel works that include heterogeneous agents and social distancing were proposed to model COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245787.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The proposed approach, called INFEKTA (Esperanto word for infectious), mainly differs from existing works in that it aims to generate individuals and a complex network of places based on the population density of a determined city including individual interaction in public transportation means.</p>
              <p>INFEKTA models the disease transition at the person level and takes into consideration individual infection disease incubation periods and evolution, medical preconditions, age, daily routines (movements from house to destination places and back, including transportation medium if required), and enforced of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions such as social distancing policies may flatten the curve.</p>

                <title>Complex systems approaches for epidemic models</title>
                <p>The complex system model approach considers a system as a large number of entities (equally complex systems that have autonomous strategies and behaviors) that interact with each other in local and non-trivial ways [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This approach provides a conceptual structure (a multi-level complex network [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) that allows characterizing the interrelation and interaction between elements of a system and between the system and its environment [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this way, a system is composed of sub-systems of second order, which in turn may be composed of subsystems of the third-order [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Transmission dynamics of infectious diseases are not traditionally modeled at the individual level, but at the population-level with a compartmental model. However, some recent research use agent-based modeling for doing that [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>

                <title>Compartmental model</title>
                <p>A compartmental model tracks changes in compartments without specifying which individuals are involved [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and typically reflects health states relevant for transmission (e.g., susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered). Basically, these kinds of models represent epidemics of communicable diseases using a population-based, non-spatial approach. The conceptual framework for this approach is rooted in the general population model which divides a population into different population compartments [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Compartmentalization typically reflects health states relevant for transmission (e.g., susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered, in short <bold>SEIR</bold>), though more partitioning is possible according to age and/or other relevant host characteristics. Heterogeneous and temporal behavior is modeled through the incorporation of relevant time-dependent social mixing, community structures, and seasonality, relevant for infectious disease dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245787.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Process dynamics are captured in transition rates, representing the rate by which an average individual transitions between compartments.</p>

                <title>Agent-based models for infectious disease</title>
                <p>Agent-based models (ABMs) are a type of computer simulation for the creation, disappearance, and movement of a finite collection of interacting individuals or agents with unique attributes regarding spatial location, physiological traits, and/or social behavior [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245787.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245787.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. ABMs work bottom-up, with population-level behavior emerging from the interactions between autonomous individuals and their environment [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245787.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. They allow the history of every individual to be tracked and network structures to be explicitly represented.</p>
                <p>In general, ABMs allow: i) To introduce local interaction rules at the individual level, which closely coincide with physical and social interaction rules; (ii) To include behaviors that may be randomized at the observational level, but can be deterministic from a mathematical point of view; (iii) To incorporate a modular structure and to add information through new types of individuals or by modifying current rules; and (iv) To observe systems dynamic that could not be inferred from the examination of the rules of particular individuals [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
                <p>When ABM is used for epidemic modeling, infectious disease transmission dynamics is expected to emerge from the interaction between local interactions between the individuals. Each individual is modeled as an agent with an internal “SEIR” state that represents its infectious disease state (severity and time in it) at any instant of time. Individuals interact between them, i.e., can infect or get infected, when they move at some instant to the same place, their SEIR states, and the infectious disease transmission rates, and how close they are (if they are in crowded places). Notice, the concept of crowded places is natural in INFEKTA and emerges from the agents’ interactions (eg. if more individuals move using the same transportation routes) and individual characteristics (e.g. children go to schools.). Transmission rates are usually approximated from the rates obtained by a compartmental model but are used at the individual level, i.e., when individuals interact with each other.</p>

IPs and PTSs are defined in terms of capacity (maximum number of individuals that can be at some simulation step time). IPs and PTSs may be restricted, during some period, to some or all individuals. Place restriction is established according to the social distancing rule that is enforced during such a period.</p>

Homes and IPs are considered neighbors to its closest PTS in the 2D Euclidean space. No home is neighbor to any other home neither an IP is neighbor of any other IP. Finally, a home and an IP are considered neighbors if they are neighbors of the same PTS. Each individual has a Home and an IP. The closest distances are computed between each Home and IP and between these places with the closest PTS using their longitude and latitude. If the distance between a Home and IP is shorter than the distance to a PTS this Home will be connected directly to an IP instead of their closest PTS. Otherwise, the closest PTS is connected to each Home and IP respectively. Detailed information can be found in Fig 2 of Section Virtual Space Setup.</p>

                <p>Any individual can potentially be in one of seven different infectious disease states or health states in INFEKTA: Immune (<italic>M</italic>), Susceptible (<italic>S</italic>), Exposed (<italic>E</italic>), Asymptomatic-Infected (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>), Seriously-Infected (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>), Critically-Infected (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>), Recovered (<italic>R</italic>), Dead (<italic>D</italic>), and Immune (<italic>M</italic>). As can be noticed, we just adapt the terminology from the compartmental models in epidemiology—namely, from the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model. In INFEKTA, the infectious state of the SEIR model is divided into asymptomatic-infected, seriously-infected, and critically-infected in order to capture how age, gender, IP preferences, medical preconditions (co-morbidity), and social distancing policies can impact the evolution of the infectious disease in an individual. INFEKTA introduces both the <italic>M</italic> state since some individuals are naturally immune to or can become immune to (after recovering) to certain infectious diseases and the Dead (<italic>D</italic>) state to distinguish between recovered and dead individuals.</p>
                <p>Since rates are defined at the individual level, these rates can be defined by taking into consideration, for example, rates at the population level (obtained from a compartmental model), age, gender, and co-morbidity presented in the individual. Remember that those rates are not defined at some time scale (as in compartmental models) but define the rule determining changes in health states of individuals being close enough for interacting at the infectious disease transmission level or after some period of time being in some state. In this way, an individual can change with probability <italic>α</italic> from <italic>S</italic> state to state <italic>E</italic> if close enough to an asymptomatic-Infected (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>) individual and will change from state <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> to state <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> if has been at state <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> with probability <italic>θ</italic> if has been on state <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> a period of time <inline-formula id="pone.0245787.e002"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0245787.e002.jpg" id="pone.0245787.e002g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M2"><mml:msub><mml:mstyle mathvariant="script"><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mstyle><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:msub></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>

                <p>INFEKTA can consider that two individuals were close enough for interacting at the transmission of the infectious disease if they were at the same place (home, interest place, or public transportation station) at the same time. In order to simplify this checking process, it is possible to consider that an individual just visited its home, final interest place, and both the initial and final PTSs when using the public transportation system.</p>

              <p>INFEKTA is used for modeling the Transmission dynamic of the COVID-19 in Bogotá city, the largest and crowded city in Colombia. Bogotá is the capital city of Colombia, its urban perimeter population is 7.412.566, is composed by 112 Zonal Planning Units (<italic>UPZ</italic>, for its acronym in spanish). Each <italic>UPZ</italic> belongs to one of the 19 urban <italic>districts</italic> in Bogotá. Also, Bogotá massive public transportation system is called <italic>Transmilenio</italic> (<italic><bold>TM</bold></italic>). TM is a bus-based system, which has 143 stations and moves near to 2.500.000 citizens every day. Data used in this research is third party data (public available data) and can be obtained from the referenced public sources [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245787.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

                <p>Geographical information of Bogotá is used as the Euclidean space where the moving and interaction complex network is defined. Each one of the TM stations is located and added to the complex network according to the real TM system [<xref rid="pone.0245787.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Also, the airport and the regional bus terminal are located and connected to the nearest TM station.</p>
                <p>Demographic information from 112 <italic>UPZ</italic> is used for generating in the Euclidean space interest places (Workplaces (W), markets (M), and schools (S)), homes (H), and people(P).

                <p>Also, a sequence of activities was assigned randomly to each individual to define a diary routine. This was done according to the person’s age and the hour of the day. For example, some agents <italic>Adolescence</italic> go to school, and some agents <italic>Adult</italic> go to work. Time to start routine -going from Home to IP and return- is randomly selected in the interval from 4h and 7h returning between the 17h and 20h. Some agents may move using the PTI system and some others while going directly to its destination place. The route an individual takes is defined according to the complex network. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245787.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows three examples of different routines (paths over the graph) for the individuals.</p>

Notice that, using the parameters reported in the literature, the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic shows one wave. As expected, the number of asymptomatic, seriously, and critically infected cases grows exponentially when a social distancing policy is not enforced. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245787.g004">Fig 4</xref> (right) shows the COVID-19 dynamics at specific ticks (i.e., after 34 days—February 03 and after 67 days—March 07). For each tick, a map of Bogotá with the dynamics is presented. The map shows the percentage of individuals at each state per <italic>UPZ</italic>. After 34 days, the majority of individuals have been Exposed, a bunch of individuals are in the infected states (asymptomatic, seriously, and critically) and few of them become recovered; After 67 days, all individuals have been exposed to the virus and stay in the recovered state. Clearly, the transmission dynamics of the infectious disease (in this case COVID-19) emerge from the local interaction of the individuals.</p>

Notice that by increasing or decreasing the infection disease rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245787.g005">Fig 5</xref> (left)), the peak of the transmission dynamics is reached sooner or later on time.

On the other hand, for high infection disease rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245787.g005">Fig 5</xref> (right)) the peak is reached in an early stage, and around half of the population is on one of the infected states (Asymptomatic, Seriously, Critically).</p>

As can be noticed, it’s evident how social distancing rules help to mitigate the exponential growth on the transmission disease dynamics (COVID-19), reducing the number of infectious cases (Asymptomatic, Seriously, and Critically). Interestingly, when the extreme social distancing rule (access to approximately 80% of interest places is restricted) the transmission disease dynamic displays a big second wave with more cases than the first wave.</p>

              <title>Conclusions and future work</title>
              <p>Modeling the Transmission dynamic of an infectious disease such as the COVID-19 is not an easy task due to its highly complex nature. When using an agent-based model, several different characteristics can be modeled, for example, the demographic information of the population being studied, the set of places and the mobility of agents in the city or town under consideration, social distancing rules that may be enforced, and the special characteristics of the infectious disease being modeled. INFEKTA is an agent-based model that allows researchers to combine and study all of those characteristics.</p>
              <p>Our preliminary results modeling the transmission dynamics of the coronavirus COVID-19 in Bogotá city, the largest and crowded city in Colombia, indicate that INFEKTA may be a valuable asset for researchers and public health decision-makers for exploring future scenarios when applying different social distancing policy rules and controlling the expansion of an infectious disease. Although we are doing a rough and no so real approximation of the transmission dynamics of the COVID19, we are able to obtain similar behaviors, in our preliminary experiments, to those reported for the COVID19 in the real world. Therefore, INFEKTA may be able to provide more accurate results if its parameters are set to real ones: disease transmission rates, virus, incubation periods, comorbidity, houses, interest places, routines, population size (close to nine millions of virtual individuals for the Bogotá city).</p>
              <p>Despite the usefulness of the INFEKTA, there are some limitations. Since there are fewer people in the model (respect to real people in Bogotá), <italic>Transmilenio</italic> stations would be less crowded than expected and the model could underestimate the transmission of the disease. Further, the model does not cover individual walking from homes to PTS because contact points correspond to a complex network presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245787.g002">Fig 2</xref>. Finally, the routines that each individual has in the simulation are equal day-to-day (i.e., Monday to Sunday with the same routine), this could influence the stochasticity nature of the model.</p>
              <p>Our future work will concentrate on studying the transmission of COVID-19 in Bogotá city by considering different scenarios of social distancing rules and by using more realistic information about: i) Relation between personal information and propagation rates of the COVID-19, ii) Places and routes, iii) Population size, and iv) Age and Medical preconditions.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Gomez,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jul 12 2020 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
              <p>
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p>

              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Journal Requirements:</p>
              <p>When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
              <p>1. Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf</ext-link></p>
              <p>2. Our internal editors have looked over your manuscript and determined that it is within the scope of our Cities as Complex Systems Call for Papers. This collection of papers is headed by a team of Guest Editors for PLOS ONE: Marta Gonzalez (University of California, Berkeley) and Diego Rybski (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research). The Collection will encompass a diverse and interdisciplinary set of research articles applying the principles of complex systems and networks to problems in urban science.  Additional information can be found on our announcement page: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://collections.plos.org/s/cities">https://collections.plos.org/s/cities</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>If you would like your manuscript to be considered for this collection, please let us know in your cover letter and we will ensure that your paper is treated as if you were responding to this call. If you would prefer to remove your manuscript from collection consideration, please specify this in the cover letter.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript describes a novel agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The model includes public transportation, which is a feature frequently ignored in mathematical and computational models. This feature is particularly relevant for the local context of Bogotá, given the potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the local public transportation system (Transmilenio). Transmission in the model occurs through interactions among individuals in different places. The places visited by each individual is based on a trajectory defined for each agent. Once infected, individuals follow a modification of the SEIR model, including seriously-infected and critically-infected individuals. The authors simulated 1001 individuals with demographic characteristics representative of Bogotá. The preliminary analyses from the authors showed that around 20% of the population would be infected within 30 days, and found that social distancing policies reduce the number of infected individuals.</p>
              <p>The model presented is interesting and the authors make an effort to include realistic interactions between individuals. However, I have some concerns about the model and the results presented. I hope my comments are useful to the authors to improve their manuscript.</p>
              <p>1. Size of the simulations and model capacity</p>
              <p>The simulations presented in this study only include 1001 individuals. This is only a small fraction of the total population of Bogotá (8+ million). I'm concerned that this small size does not represent the density of the city. The synthetic population is geographically located according to the population density of the city, but with only 1001 individuals, the density of contacts is much lower than in reality. In this sense, the authors might be simulating a much less dense city than Bogotá. In addition, the small sample size would increase the impact of stochastic effects in the model, so that the epidemic could die out much sooner than expected.. This can explain why the authors found a similar effect of reducing social interactions by 75% than by 95%. I recommend looking into other agent-based models that don't simulate the entire population (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mobs-lab.org/uploads/6/7/8/7/6787877/tracing_main_may4.pdf">https://www.mobs-lab.org/uploads/6/7/8/7/6787877/tracing_main_may4.pdf</ext-link>). Also, multiple simulations of the model could account for these stochastic effects, but the authors do not mention how many replicates were simulated with the same set of parameters.</p>
              <p>2. Epidemiological model</p>
              <p>The transmission model might not be the appropriate for SARS-CoV-2. As I understand the model, exposed individuals are able to transmit the virus, which doesn't account for the incubation period of the virus. In addition to the incubation period, two important aspects of SARS-CoV-2 transmission should be included: asymptomatic transmission and pre-symptomatic transmission.</p>
              <p>3. Place-specific contact rate/transmission probability</p>
              <p>It's unclear to me if the transmission rates are the same for each place. If so, this might be unrealistic. The authors should account for place-specific contact rates to determine the transmission probability. For instance, if an individual works in a workplace with 1,000 employees, would INFEKTA consider that these contacts are as relevant for transmission as household contacts are?</p>
              <p>4. Simulation experiments</p>
              <p>The simulation experiments in this manuscript might not be enough to show the model capabilities. The current simulation experiments only take into consideration social distancing but the authors omit any specific public transportation intervention. Given that including public transportation routes is a strength of this work, the authors could perform some simulations that show the impact of changes in public transportation schedules and capacity. Current policies in Bogotá limit the capacity of transmilenio to about 35% of total capacity. The authors could explore similar strategies. Finally, it isn't clear how transmission occurs in the public transportation. Does it only happen in the terminals or bus routes?</p>
              <p>Other comments:</p>
              <p>- Abstract: "a Euclidean" should be "an Euclidean"</p>
              <p>- Abstract: What are the main results of this study?</p>
              <p>- Line 17-18. Try to avoid using "predicting", use estimating or projecting instead</p>
              <p>- Lines 24-25. Should "social separation" be "social distancing"?</p>
              <p>- Lines 26 - 77. This section might be unnecessarily long, and could be a part of the introduction. More importantly, I suggest that the authors elaborate more on the recent agent-based models available in the literature for COVID-19. It would be helpful to have more context on the current modeling approaches (Examples: Ferguson et al., or Vespigniani et al.) and how INFEKTA compares to those models.</p>
              <p>- Lines 99-102. "No home is neighbor to any other home". Does this mean that neighborhood interactions among individuals only occur at public transportation stations?</p>
              <p>- Line 145. Please explain Figure 1 with more detail.</p>
              <p>- Methods: It isn't clear to me if the parameters for transmission are fixed parameters or drawn from a distribution.</p>
              <p>- Methods: It isn't clear to me which processes are random and which are deterministic in the model.</p>
              <p>- Methods: Please explain in more detail how the synthetic population was created to match demographic characteristics of Bogotá.</p>
              <p>- Lines 188-232: How do the authors account for the difference in the 1001 people in the simulation and the actual population of Bogotá? If the entire city is being simulated but only 1001 people are modeled, how does this affect the transmission dynamics? Is there any factor to account for the difference in synthetic and real density?</p>
              <p>- Lines: 286-290. This could be caused by the small sample size. Stochastic effects can make a big difference with only 1001 people simulated.</p>
              <p>- Discussion: How does this model compare to other ABMs around the world?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: 1. In abstract, the sentence “In this paper, a general agent-based model, called…”, I am not sure what authors mean by a general agent-based model. The word general sounds like a specific type of ABM. I suggest to explain what the word “general” means in this context, and if the ABM is a regular ABM, this word in unnecessary.</p>
              <p>2. I suggest that authors add at least one more line in the abstract where one central or maybe the most important result of the paper is presented. I believe that usually this attracts reader attention.</p>
              <p>3. In introduction, the sentence (line 10) “Complex systems are computational approaches that make use of computer-based algorithms to model dynamic interactions between individuals agents…” is not accurate. Please, revise the complex systems concept. Actually, this sentence make an inversion between complex systems and computer-based algorithms. Complex systems may be simulated by using computer algorithms, but the concept of such systems are wider than the one expressed in this sentence.</p>
              <p>4. I think that the subsection “Complex Systems Approaches for Epidemic Models” (line 26) would make more sense if it is locate after the subsection “Compartmental Model” (line 37). Thus, the new sequence would be “Compartmental Model” and after this subsection, “Complex Systems Approaches for Epidemic Models”. My argument is that initially authors should explain what compartmental models are and the limitations they might have. After that, an introduction about complex systems approach an then, the ABM subsection.</p>
              <p>5. First paragraph of the subsection “Agent-based models for infectious disease” is fine, although I think authors could add a comment about that agents in an ABM model may take decisions based on some system conditions or rules.</p>
              <p>6. Lines 67 to 70 are repeating what was already mentioned about ABMs and complex system, then I suggest, as these lines a redundant, they could be deleted.</p>
              <p>7. The sentence in lines 73 to 75 are not very clear to me. Is this what authors meant: In this way, each virtual individual includes its health state, as implemented in a SEIR model, which is fundamental for the infectious disease transmission?</p>
              <p>8. In Section “INFEKTA Agent-Based Model”, for the sake of simplicity, the first paragraph should be reduced to “Our agent-based model of infectious disease propagation, called INFEKTA, consists of five-layer components:”. The remaining part of line 80 until line 85 may be delete because each one of the model layers are explained right after the colon. Therefore, I think that the text would benefit of clarity if each layer does not have subsection, maybe items or subitens. For instance, the layer “Space” should explain “Place (Node)” and “Neighbor (Edge)” as part of the same text the item “Space”. The same idea may be applied to explanation of the other remaining layers.</p>
              <p>9. Lines 87 to 90: important concepts of the model are presented in these lines. Part of them are between parentheses, so I suggest that they be place between commas, because they are fundamental to understand the concept that is being exposed.</p>
              <p>10. Neighbor (Edge), line 98: concept is simple but the relations (neighborhood) among them are not very clear in the explanation. Authors may consider two options: re-write the sentence or add a simple figure representing each concept and the relations among them.</p>
              <p>11. Line 100, the footnote: replace "in" by "In".</p>
              <p>12. Line 119. What is “Going hour”? There is no definition for it in the text.</p>
              <p>13. Line 135. In the case of covid-19, as literally everybody is susceptible to the SARS-Cov-2 virus, the health state “Immune (M)” only makes sense when the individual is recovered from the disease. However, the “Recovered (R)” health state is also defined in the model. Then, my question is: what is the difference between the two health states? Besides, in line 142, authors say “INFEKTA introduces both the M state since some individuals are naturally immune”. In the literature, one can find that, if so, only a few persons have some partial immunity against SARS-Cov (not SARS-Cov-2), however, this is not a lifetime imunnity and this outbreak happened in the early 2000’s. Moreover, the amount of people infected with SARS-Cov is so small and geographically restricted that does not justify to model a pandemic caused by SARS-Cov-2 considering that some individuals have any prior immunity. Then, this part of the text has to be re-written.</p>
              <p>Figure 1 shows clearly the immunity is acquired only after the individual has recovered from the infection: this is the correct dynamics of covid-19 outbreak and, as recovered individuals have acquired immunity immune, a new compartment called “M” is not necessary.</p>
              <p>In addition, in Fig.1, there is a line from R compartment to S compartment, meaning that recovered individuals become susceptible again. So far, in the literature about covid-19 pandemic there is no evidence that recovered individuals become susceptible again. Thus, this fact implies that this model has to be considered incorrect and for this reason, until this correction is made, I suggest the paper is rejected.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: </p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating our paper updates and for providing further constructive suggestions on how to improve the next version. We hope to have addressed these in a satisfactory manner, as explained below, point-by-point.</p>
              <p>1. Size of the simulations and model capacity: The simulations presented in this study only include 1001 individuals. This is only a small fraction of the total population of Bogotá (8+ million). I'm concerned that this small size does not represent the density of the city. The synthetic population is geographically located according to the population density of the city, but with only 1001 individuals, the density of contacts is much lower than in reality. In this sense, the authors might be simulating a much less dense city than Bogotá. In addition, the small sample size would increase the impact of stochastic effects in the model, so that the epidemic could die out much sooner than expected.. This can explain why the authors found a similar effect of reducing social interactions by 75% than by 95%. I recommend looking into other agent-based models that don't simulate the entire population (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mobs-lab.org/uploads/6/7/8/7/6787877/tracing_main_may4.pdf">https://www.mobs-lab.org/uploads/6/7/8/7/6787877/tracing_main_may4.pdf</ext-link>). Also, multiple simulations of the model could account for these stochastic effects, but the authors do not mention how many replicates were simulated with the same set of parameters.</p>
              <p>+ We followed this recommendation and performed new experiments with 998.213 agents. Bogotá has a population of 7.412.566 and it is composed by 112 Zonal Planning Units (UPZ, for its acronym in spanish). Each UPZ belongs to one of the 19 urban districts in Bogotá. The number of places in each UPZ was generated based on the population density of each UPZ according to the data available in 2017 obtained from public information available by the District Planning Secretary: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sdp.gov.co/gestion-estudios-estrategicos/estudios-macro/proyecciones-de-poblacion">http://www.sdp.gov.co/gestion-estudios-estrategicos/estudios-macro/proyecciones-de-poblacion</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>The following idea was added to clarify this query: The number of places in each UPZ is generated based on the population density of each UPZ according to the data available in 2017 [27]. Table 1 shows the amount of data generated for each type of place and for people, also the number of TM stations (Bus), and terminal transportation that we use in the simulation, and Table 2 shows a detailed information of the number of interest places generated by UPZ.</p>
              <p>2. Epidemiological model</p>
              <p>The transmission model might not be the appropriate for SARS-CoV-2. As I understand the model, exposed individuals are able to transmit the virus, which doesn't account for the incubation period of the virus. In addition to the incubation period, two important aspects of SARS-CoV-2 transmission should be included: asymptomatic transmission and pre-symptomatic transmission.</p>
              <p>+ We have included a more detailed description of the model in section Agents based model for infectious disease and include a clock symbol that indicates a period of time able to change to another state. The reviewer is right. We include the Asymptomatic-Infected (IA) state after the exposed one to model the incubation period of the virus. </p>
              <p>3. Place-specific contact rate/transmission probability</p>
              <p>It's unclear to me if the transmission rates are the same for each place. If so, this might be unrealistic. The authors should account for place-specific contact rates to determine the transmission probability. For instance, if an individual works in a workplace with 1,000 employees, would INFEKTA consider that these contacts are as relevant for transmission as household contacts are?</p>
              <p>+ We model fixed probabilities to model changes of state of an individual. Probabilities are applied if two individuals are close enough in the same place or transportation station. It means that more dense places implies more possible infected individuals.</p>
              <p>In section Agents based model for infectious disease we added: </p>
              <p>Each individual is modelled as an agent with an internal ”SEIR” state that represents its infectious disease state (severity and time in it) at any instant of time. Individuals interact between them, i.e., can infect or get infected, when they move at some instant to the same place, their SEIR states, and the infectious disease transmission rates, and how close they are (if they are in crowded places). Notice, the concept of crowded places is natural in INFEKTA and emerges from the agents interactions (eg. if more individuals move using the same transportation’s routes) and individual characteristics (e.g. children go to schools.).</p>
              <p>4. Simulation experiments</p>
              <p>The simulation experiments in this manuscript might not be enough to show the model capabilities. The current simulation experiments only take into consideration social distancing but the authors omit any specific public transportation intervention. Given that including public transportation routes is a strength of this work, the authors could perform some simulations that show the impact of changes in public transportation schedules and capacity. Current policies in Bogotá limit the capacity of transmilenio to about 35% of total capacity. The authors could explore similar strategies. Finally, it isn't clear how transmission occurs in the public transportation. Does it only happen in the terminals or bus routes?</p>
              <p>+ Indeed, this aspect wasn’t clear in the paper and we thank the reviewer for pointing it out. By now, we don't cover the capacity limit of transmilenio but model individual dynamics. As in the previous answer we add the following idea: Notice, the concept of crowded places is natural in INFEKTA and emerges from the agents interactions (eg. if more individuals move using the same transportation’s routes) and individual characteristics (e.g. children go to schools.).</p>
              <p>In the section individual setup we added the following: </p>
              <p>Also, a sequence of activities was assigned randomly to each individual to define a diary routine. This was done according to the person’s age and the hour of the day. For example, some agents Adolescence go to school, and some agents Adult go to work. Time to start routine -going from Home to IP and return- is randomly selected in the interval from 4h and 7h returning between the 17h and 20h.</p>
              <p>Other comments:</p>
              <p>- Abstract: "a Euclidean" should be "an Euclidean" (fixed, thank you)</p>
              <p>- Abstract: What are the main results of this study? </p>
              <p>+ The abstract was rewritten and main results of the study were included: This paper proposes an agent-based model, called INFEKTA, for simulating the transmission of infectious diseases, not only the COVID19, under social distancing policies.INFEKTA combines the transmission dynamic of an specific disease, (according to parameters found in the literature) with demographic information (population density, age, and genre of individuals) of geopolitical regions of the real town or city under study. Agents (virtual persons) can move, according to its mobility routines and the enforced social distancing policy, on a complex network of accessible places defined over an Euclidean space representing the town or city. The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 under different social distancing policies in Bogotá city, the capital of Colombia, is simulated using INFEKTA with one million virtual persons. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of those social distancing policies on the disease rates (Asymptomatic, Seriously, and Critically) indicates that it is possible to establish a not so ’hard’ social distancing policy to achieve a significant reduction on the disease rate.</p>
              <p>- Line 17-18. Try to avoid using "predicting", use estimating or predicting instead (fixed, thank you)</p>
              <p>- Lines 24-25. Should "social separation" be "social distancing"? (fixed, thank you)</p>
              <p>- Lines 26 - 77. This section might be unnecessarily long, and could be a part of the introduction. More importantly, I suggest that the authors elaborate more on the recent agent-based models available in the literature for COVID-19. It would be helpful to have more context on the current modeling approaches (Examples: Ferguson et al., or Vespigniani et al.) and how INFEKTA compares to those models.</p>
              <p>+ Some other agent models were added in the following paragraph: In the past, ABMs have been employed to address various infectious diseases such as, a bioterrorist introduction of smallpox [9], control of tuberculosis [10], implementation of distancing measures and antiviral prophylaxis to control H5N1 influenza A (bird20flu) [11], design of vaccination strategies for influenza [12], devise evacuation strategies in the event of airborne contamination [13], and curtail transmission of measles through contact tracing and quarantine [14]. While this paper was under revision, some other works that include heterogeneous agents and social distancing were proposed to model COVID-19 [15, 16]. The proposed approach, called INFEKTA (Esperanto word for infectious), mainly differs from existing works in that it aims to generate individuals and a complex network of places based on the population density of a determined city.</p>
              <p>- Lines 99-102. "No home is neighbor to any other home". Does this mean that neighborhood interactions among individuals only occur at public transportation stations? </p>
              <p>+ The idea was extended as follows: Each individual has a Home and an IP. The closest distances are computed between each Home and IP and between these places with the closest PTS using their longitude and latitude. If the distance between a Home and IP is shorter than the distance to a PTS this Home will be connected directly to an IP instead of their closest PTS. Otherwise, the closest PTS is connected to each Home and IP respectively. Detailed information can be found in the Figure 2 of Section Virtual Space Setup.</p>
              <p>- Line 145. Please explain Figure 1 with more detail.</p>
              <p>+ Description of Figure 1, was extended and also the section to give more details to the model.</p>
              <p>- Methods: It isn't clear to me if the parameters for transmission are fixed parameters or drawn from a distribution. </p>
              <p>Parameters are fixed values extracted from a literature review. </p>
              <p>+ We wrapped them in the transition rates and allowed modelers to change and play with different rates. Therefore, we set the initial values of these rates as shown in Table 4.</p>
              <p>- Methods: It isn't clear to me which processes are random and which are deterministic in the model.</p>
              <p>To address this comment, we added Table 4 that describes the initial parameters of Infekta based on a literature review. + Probabilities and distribution of individuals are random and specific times are deterministic.</p>
              <p>- Methods: Please explain in more detail how the synthetic population was created to match demographic characteristics of Bogotá. </p>
              <p>+ We have clarified this aspect in the reply to comment #1. </p>
              <p>- Lines 188-232: How do the authors account for the difference in the 1001 people in the simulation and the actual population of Bogotá? If the entire city is being simulated but only 1001 people are modeled, how does this affect the transmission dynamics? Is there any factor to account for the difference in synthetic and real density?</p>
              <p>We have clarified this aspect in the reply to comment #1. </p>
              <p>- Lines: 286-290. This could be caused by the small sample size. Stochastic effects can make a big difference with only 1001 people simulated.</p>
              <p>+ We have clarified this aspect in the reply to comment #1. We thank the reviewer for this. </p>
              <p>- Discussion: How does this model compare to other ABMs around the world?</p>
              <p>+ Some other agent models were added in the following paragraph: In the past, ABMs have been employed to address various infectious diseases such as, a bioterrorist introduction of smallpox [9], control of tuberculosis [10], implementation of distancing measures and antiviral prophylaxis to control H5N1 influenza A (bird20flu) [11], design of vaccination strategies for influenza [12], devise evacuation strategies in the event of airborne contamination [13], and curtail transmission of measles through contact tracing and quarantine [14].

              <p>Reviewer #2: </p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating our paper updates and for providing further constructive suggestions on how to improve the next version. We hope to have addressed these in a satisfactory manner, as explained below, point-by-point.</p>
              <p>1. In abstract, the sentence “In this paper, a general agent-based model, called…”, I am not sure what authors mean by a general agent-based model. The word general sounds like a specific type of ABM. I suggest to explain what the word “general” means in this context, and if the ABM is a regular ABM, this word is unnecessary.</p>
              <p>+ Word general has been removed from the abstract. And clarify this point </p>
              <p>This paper proposes an agent-based model, called INFEKTA, for simulating the transmission of infectious diseases, not only the COVID19, under social distancing policies. INFEKTA combines the transmission dynamic of an specific disease, (according to parameters found in the literature) with demographic information (population density, age, and genre of individuals) of geopolitical regions of the real town or city under study. Agents (virtual persons) can move, according to its mobility routines and the enforced social distancing policy, on a complex network of accessible places defined over an Euclidean space representing the town or city. </p>
              <p>2. I suggest that authors add at least one more line in the abstract where one central or maybe the most important result of the paper is presented. I believe that usually this attracts reader attention.</p>
              <p>+ Thanks for this suggestion we rewrite the abstract as follows: This paper proposes an agent-based model, called INFEKTA, for simulating the transmission of infectious diseases, not only the COVID19, under social distancing policies.INFEKTA combines the transmission dynamic of an specific disease, (according to parameters found in the literature) with demographic information (population density, age, and genre of individuals) of geopolitical regions of the real town or city under study. Agents (virtual persons) can move, according to its mobility routines and the enforced social distancing policy, on a complex network of accessible places defined over an Euclidean space representing the town or city. The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 under different social distancing policies in Bogotá city, the capital of Colombia, is simulated using INFEKTA with one million virtual persons. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of those social distancing policies on the disease rates (Asymptomatic, Seriously, and Critically) indicates that it is possible to establish a not so ’hard’ social distancing policy to achieve a significant reduction on the disease rate.</p>
              <p>3. In introduction, the sentence (line 10) “Complex systems are computational approaches that make use of computer-based algorithms to model dynamic interactions between individuals agents…” is not accurate. Please, revise the complex systems concept. Actually, this sentence makes an inversion between complex systems and computer-based algorithms. Complex systems may be simulated by using computer algorithms, but the concept of such systems are wider than the one expressed in this sentence.</p>
              <p>+ Indeed, the reviewer is right. We state the following: Many biological systems have been modeled in terms of complex systems since their collective behavior cannot be simply inferred from the understanding of their components.</p>
              <p>Additionally, We replaced “Complex systems are computational approaches” for “Complex systems may be simulated by using computer-based algorithms to model dynamic interactions between individuals agents (e.g. persons, cells) or groups and their properties, within, and across levels of influence [6, 7].” </p>
              <p>4. I think that the subsection “Complex Systems Approaches for Epidemic Models” (line 26) would make more sense if it is locate after the subsection “Compartmental Model” (line 37). Thus, the new sequence would be “Compartmental Model” and after this subsection, “Complex Systems Approaches for Epidemic Models”. My argument is that initially authors should explain what compartmental models are and the limitations they might have. After that, an introduction about complex systems approach an then, the ABM subsection.</p>
              <p>+ Since for our model the most important part is the complex network of places more than the compartmental model, we decide to adopt the current structure. We added examples and Figures like Figure 3 to clarify why we adopt this subsection structure.</p>
              <p>5. First paragraph of the subsection “Agent-based models for infectious disease” is fine, although I think authors could add a comment about that agents in an ABM model may take decisions based on some system conditions or rules.</p>
              <p>+ In section Agents based model for infectious disease we added: </p>
              <p>Each individual is modelled as an agent with an internal ”SEIR” state that represents its infectious disease state (severity and time in it) at any instant of time. Individuals interact between them, i.e., can infect or get infected, when they move at some instant to the same place, their SEIR states, and the infectious disease transmission rates, and how close they are (if they are in crowded places). Notice, the concept of crowded places is natural in INFEKTA and emerges from the agents interactions (eg. if more individuals move using the same transportation’s routes) and individual characteristics (e.g. children go to schools.).</p>
              <p>6. Lines 67 to 70 are repeating what was already mentioned about ABMs and complex system, then I suggest, as these lines a redundant, they could be deleted. (fixed, thank you)</p>
              <p>7. The sentence in lines 73 to 75 are not very clear to me. Is this what authors meant: In this way, each virtual individual includes its health state, as implemented in a SEIR model, which is fundamental for the infectious disease transmission?</p>
              <p>+ We added the paragraph presented as the answer to comment 5 to clarify the idea.</p>
              <p>8. In Section “INFEKTA Agent-Based Model”, for the sake of simplicity, the first paragraph should be reduced to “Our agent-based model of infectious disease propagation, called INFEKTA, consists of five-layer components:”. The remaining part of line 80 until line 85 may be delete because each one of the model layers are explained right after the colon. Therefore, I think that the text would benefit of clarity if each layer does not have subsection, maybe items or subitens. For instance, the layer “Space” should explain “Place (Node)” and “Neighbor (Edge)” as part of the same text the item “Space”. The same idea may be applied to explanation of the other remaining layers. (fixed, thank you)</p>
              <p>9. Lines 87 to 90: important concepts of the model are presented in these lines. Part of them are between parentheses, so I suggest that they be place between commas, because they are fundamental to understand the concept that is being exposed. (fixed, thank you)</p>
              <p>10. Neighbor (Edge), line 98: concept is simple but the relations (neighborhood) among them are not very clear in the explanation. Authors may consider two options: re-write the sentence or add a simple figure representing each concept and the relations among them.</p>
              <p>+ The sentence was clarified as follows: Each individual has a Home and an IP. The closest distances are computed between each Home and IP and between these places with the closest PTS using their longitude and latitude. If the distance between a Home and IP is shorter than the distance to a PTS this Home will be connected directly to an IP instead of their closest PTS. Otherwise, the closest PTS is connected to each Home and IP respectively. Detailed information can be found in the Figure 2 of Section Virtual Space Setup.</p>
              <p>11. Line 100, the footnote: replace "in" by "In". (fixed, thank you)</p>
              <p>12. Line 119. What is “Going hour”? There is no definition for it in the text.</p>
              <p>Definition was added: Going hour is the time an individual moves from Home to a IP. In section individuals setup the following was added: Time to start routine -going from Home to IP and return- is randomly selected in the interval from 4h and 7h returning between the 17h and 20h. </p>
              <p>13. Line 135. In the case of covid-19, as literally everybody is susceptible to the SARS-Cov-2 virus, the health state “Immune (M)” only makes sense when the individual is recovered from the disease. However, the “Recovered (R)” health state is also defined in the model. Then, my question is: what is the difference between the two health states? Besides, in line 142, authors say “INFEKTA introduces both the M state since some individuals are naturally immune”. In the literature, one can find that, if so, only a few persons have some partial immunity against SARS-Cov (not SARS-Cov-2), however, this is not a lifetime imunnity and this outbreak happened in the early 2000’s. Moreover, the amount of people infected with SARS-Cov is so small and geographically restricted that does not justify to model a pandemic caused by SARS-Cov-2 considering that some individuals have any prior immunity. Then, this part of the text has to be re-written.</p>
              <p> + Figure 1 shows clearly the immunity is acquired only after the individual has recovered from the infection: this is the correct dynamics of covid-19 outbreak and, as recovered individuals have acquired immunity immune, a new compartment called “M” is not necessary.</p>
              <p>In addition, in Fig.1, there is a line from R compartment to S compartment, meaning that recovered individuals become susceptible again. So far, in the literature about covid-19 pandemic there is no evidence that recovered individuals become susceptible again. Thus, this fact implies that this model has to be considered incorrect and for this reason, until this correction is made, I suggest the paper is rejected.</p>
              <p>In the abstract we added the following: This paper proposes an agent-based model, called INFEKTA, for simulating the transmission of infectious diseases, not only the COVID19, under social distancing policies. When presenting Figure 1 we clarified this aspect mentioned by the reviewer: Figure 1 shows the general transition dynamics of any infectious disease at the individual level in INFEKTA. This model can be adjusted to any specific infectious disease by setting some of the probabilities to specific values. For example, if there is no evidence that recovered individuals become immune or susceptible again, such probabilities can be set to 0.0.</p>

              <p>First, I apologize for my misguided comment on `a Eucledian`. It is indeed spelled `a Eucledian`, not `an Eucledian`.</p>
              <p>- There is still an issue with my first comment regarding the stochasticity nature of the model and the population size. In terms of the stochasticity, the authors only report the mean of their results, do not include any uncertainty. For the population size, I understand the need for simplification in the population size, but the authors should at least add in the discussion what impact does this underestimation have in their results. For instance, transmilenio buses or stations would be less crowded than expected, given that there are fewer people in the model. In general, the authors should add a section in the discussion listing the model limitations.</p>
              <p>- The authors added a couple of other models in their introduction, which I appreciate. I don't agree that this model differentiates in having a complex network of places and population density. Several of the agent-based models that have been available for a long time to simulate COVID-19 include realistic representations of human activities and their population demographic characteristics. Including public transportation might be a more unique characteristic of this model. Also, there are many more than two abm for COVID-19, and have been released before this manuscript was under review.</p>
              <p>- For future reviews. Please add the line numbers where the changes have been made. It is difficult to follow the responses without the lines where the changes were made.</p>
              <p>- Abstract: `not so hard` -&gt; please use specific and descriptive words.</p>
              <p>- Line 306-309. the statement "indicate that INFEKTA may be a valuable asset for researchers and public health decision-makers for projecting fugure scenarios when applying social distancing policy rules" is not supported by their results. 1. The authors do not contrast their simulations to any data in the manuscript to calibrate model parameters, 2. The authors do not make any projections and contrast them with epidemiological data in Bogotá. If the model is not validated with data, how can it be used to project future scenarios? I think the model could be used to explore scenarios, but not to project or predict.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: As the authors have addressed all the suggestions and requested corrections, I think the paper is suitable to be published.</p>

              <p>Dear Editor,</p>
              <p>First, we would like to thank you for providing further constructive suggestions on how to improve the next version. We provide a few answers and clarifications for each outstanding comment below. Answers to the queries are in blue and literal changes added to the paper are in red.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: </p>
              <p>Many thanks for providing further constructive suggestions on how to improve the next version. We hope to have addressed these in a satisfactory manner, as explained below, point-by-point.</p>
              <p>1. There is still an issue with my first comment regarding the stochasticity nature of the model and the population size. In terms of the stochasticity, the authors only report the mean of their results, do not include any uncertainty. For the population size, I understand the need for simplification in the population size, but the authors should at least add in the discussion what impact does this underestimation have in their results. For instance, transmilenio buses or stations would be less crowded than expected, given that there are fewer people in the model. In general, the authors should add a section in the discussion listing the model limitations.</p>
              <p>- Standard deviation data were added to Figures 4, 5 and 6 that corresponds to the experiments performed.</p>
              <p>- Also, we add a paragraph with the limitations in lines 250-256: Despite the usefulness of the INFEKTA, there are some limitations. Since there are fewer people in the model (respect to real people in Bogotá), Transmilenio stations would be less crowded than expected and the model could underestimate the transmission of the disease. Further, the model does not cover individual walking from homes to PTS because contact points correspond to a complex network presented in Figure 2. Finally, the routines that each individual has in the simulation are equal day-to-day (i.e., Monday to Sunday with the same routine), this could influence the stochasticity nature of the model.</p>
              <p>2. The authors added a couple of other models in their introduction, which I appreciate. I don't agree that this model differentiates in having a complex network of places and population density. Several of the agent-based models that have been available for a long time to simulate COVID-19 include realistic representations of human activities and their population demographic characteristics. Including public transportation might be a more unique characteristic of this model. Also, there are many more than two abm for COVID-19, and have been released before this manuscript was under review.</p>
              <p>- Thank you for this comment. Lines 23 - 28 were updated: In our literature review, some other novel works that include heterogeneous agents and social distancing were proposed to model COVID-19 [15],[16]. The proposed approach, called INFEKTA (Esperanto word for infectious), mainly differs from existing works in that it aims to generate individuals and a complex network of places based on the population density of a determined city including individual interaction in public transportation means.</p>
              <p>3. For future reviews. Please add the line numbers where the changes have been made. It is difficult to follow the responses without the lines where the changes were made. </p>
              <p>- (Thanks for your advice)</p>
              <p>4. Abstract: `not so hard` -&gt; please use specific and descriptive words.</p>
              <p>- At the end of the Abstract we change the word ‘hard’ by ‘medium’ and give the corresponding definition (The full description of the ‘medium’ social-distance policy is in the line 251, section Social Distancing Rule Setting): A sensitivity analysis of the impact of social distancing policies indicates that it is possible to establish a 'medium' (i.e., close 40\\% of the places) social distancing policy to achieve a significant reduction in the disease transmission.</p>
              <p>5. Line 306-309. the statement "indicate that INFEKTA may be a valuable asset for researchers and public health decision-makers for projecting future scenarios when applying social distancing policy rules" is not supported by their results. 1. The authors do not contrast their simulations to any data in the manuscript to calibrate model parameters, 2. The authors do not make any projections and contrast them with epidemiological data in Bogotá. If the model is not validated with data, how can it be used to project future scenarios? I think the model could be used to explore scenarios, but not to project or predict.</p>
              <p>- Word projecting was changed by exploring (lines 325-328) and figure 7 was added as shown in the paper (lines 297-306):</p>
              <p>- Although our intention was not to predict geographic spread for the city, we observed similarities between the total Seriously-Infected cases in INFEKTA (we assume that individuals in Seriously-Infected state are cases tested in Bogotá) and the current concentration of COVID-19 cases confirmed in Bogotá, see Figure 7. The results show how UPZ with more cases found with INFEKTA matches with geographic areas with more COVID-19 cases. Then, how population distribution is generated from real density data of Bogotá, INFEKTA can be useful to explore policies by Zonal Planning Units (UPZ) or territorial divisions of a selected place providing to recommend actions for before, during, and after pandemic i.e., in planning and coordination efforts through leadership and coordination across sectors.</p>
