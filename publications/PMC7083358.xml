          <body>
            <p>An ecological study aiming to describe the burden of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS) and its trends in Brazil from 1980 to 2015 showed that the incidence of this
disease remains high, with a tendency to increase in the incoming years<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>. Additionally, it is estimated that currently in Brazil, approximately one in
every five men who have sex with men is infected with human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>. Considering this scenario, it is imperative that efforts must be made to
improve the performance of AIDS prevention programs, taking into account the significant
heterogeneity and complexity of the distribution of the disease in Brazil due to
cultural, sociopolitical, and economic factors of the different regions<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>.</p>
            <p>Considering the 27 Brazilian Federal Units as units of analysis, an ecological study
evaluated the spatiotemporal distribution of the standardized incidence rates of AIDS
among adults in Brazil from 2006 to 2012 and showed significant regional differences in
the disease incidence<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>. The authors showed that Federal Units with higher Human Development Index (HDI)
had higher incidence of the disease than Federal Units with lower HDI<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>. Similarly, a study on the geographic distribution of AIDS in the State of Rio
de Janeiro, Southeast Brazil, showed a heterogeneous distribution pattern of the disease
across the municipalities of the state and a significant association between the number
of new cases of the disease and socioeconomic variables such as income inequality,
income per capita, and the education component of HDI<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>. Consequently, considering the administrative districts of São Paulo City as
units of analysis, another ecological study<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> showed a positive association between HDI and AIDS incidence among males from
2000 to 2010, but no associations were observed between these variables from 2011 to
2016. These studies are important since they provide a better understanding on the
association between AIDS incidence and surrounding socioeconomic conditions and how
geography influences these associations<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>, and their results are useful for public health planners and policy-makers in
designing more effective preventive strategies and services.</p>
            <p>In the present study, we used spatial statistical methods to describe the spatiotemporal
distribution of notified new AIDS cases in Brazil between 2012 and 2016, considering the
intermediate regions as units of analysis. In 2017, the regional geographic division of
Brazil was based on clusters of municipalities called mesoregions and microregions. This
year, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) proposed a new
division, where the municipalities are now clustered into intermediate and immediate
geographic regions<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>. Immediate regions are groups of adjacent municipalities that are clustered
together taking into account their geographic features and have a local urban center as
a base. Intermediate regions are groupings of immediate regions that are articulated by
the influence of one or more metropolitan regions, regional capitals, and/or
representative urban centers. In this context, data from the Internet free access
Brazilian HealthCare Computer System (DATASUS, Departamento de Informática do SUS)
regarding the number of new AIDS cases in each municipality were collected and
subsequently clustered accordingly to the corresponding intermediate regions. The study
also investigated the association between the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of
the intermediate regions and the AIDS incidence in 2016. Data on GDP was obtained from
the IBGE.</p>
            <p>The Global Moran’s Index (I<sup>2</sup>) was estimated annually to detect spatial
heterogeneity in the distribution of the disease, and Local Indicators of Spatial
Association (LISA) were used to identify the locations of significant clusters of AIDS
incidence. A Bayesian spatiotemporal model<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> was used to obtain smoothed incidence estimates of AIDS in each of the R = 133
intermediate regions. It was assumed that Y(p,s,t), the number of AIDS cases notified in
the intermediate region p (p=1,…,133), considering gender s (s=1 for males, s=2 for
females) and year t (t=1 for 2012, t=2 for 2013, and so on), followed a Poisson
distribution with mean given by N(p,s,t) × m(p,s,t). In this case, N(p,s,t) was the
population for the intermediate region p, considering gender s and year t (data from
IBGE), and m(p,s,t) was the correspondent incidence rate given by m(p,s,t) = exp[a(s,t)
× w(s,p) × b(p,s,t)]. In the hierarchical Bayesian analysis, a(s,t) were unknown
parameters following a s-variate normal distribution with zero means and a covariance
matrix following a Wishart distribution, and b(p,s,t) were random interaction terms
following a normal distribution with different variances annually. Additionally, it was
assumed that the spatial effects w(s,p) followed a bivariate normal intrinsic
conditional auto-regressive structure. A similar model, including the effect of a
covariate, was used to investigate the association between the GDP per capita of the
intermediate regions and the AIDS incidence. R software was used to obtain the values of
Moran and LISA statistics, and OpenBUGS software was used to fit the Bayesian model to
the data, based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>. All these statistical methods were based on Queen spatial weights.</p>
            <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> shows the spatial distribution of the
smoothed incidence rates of AIDS for males and females, considering the years 2012,
2014, and 2016. Maps for the other years are not shown because of the large number of
data. Considering the male population, in 2012, the median smoothed AIDS incidence was
17.68 cases per 100,000 inhabitants among the 133 intermediate regions (interquartile
range [IQR], 10.99 to 27.15). In 2014, this median incidence was 19.42 cases per 100,000
inhabitants (IQR, 12.25 to 28.60), and in 2016, the median incidence was 18.18 cases per
100,000 inhabitants (IQR, 11.55 to 26.91). In 2012, the Brazilian intermediate regions
had a median smoothed incidence of 11.19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants among females
(IQR, 7.36 to 16.15). In 2014, this median incidence was 10.37 cases per 100,000
inhabitants (IQR, 6.83 to 14.94), and in 2016, the median incidence was 8.44 cases per
100,000 inhabitants (IQR, 5.75 to 12.88).</p>

            <p>After smoothing, the highest AIDS incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants among males in
2016 were 71.04 cases in the intermediate region of Florianópolis (State of Santa
Catarina, South Region), 59.14 cases in Manaus (North Region), 56.4 cases in Porto
Alegre (State of Rio Grande do Sul, South Region), 51.88 cases in Boa Vista (North
Region), 51.83 cases in Belém (North Region), and 45.98 cases in Rondonópolis
(Center-West Region). In females, the highest rates per 100,000 inhabitants in 2016 were
36.31 cases in the intermediate region of Porto Alegre, 35.09 cases in Florianópolis,
26.42 cases in Pelotas (State of Rio Grande do Sul), 45.98 cases in Rondonópolis, 51.83
cases in Belém, and 42.89 cases in Blumenau (State of Santa Catarina).</p>
            <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> also shows the maps describing the spatial
distribution of the male to female incidence ratio (IR) for AIDS in the Brazilian
intermediate regions. In the years 2012, 2014, and 2016, the median for the male to
female IR, were 1.51 (IQR, 1.27 to 1.78), 1.73 (IQR, 1.49 to 2.05), and 1.98 (IQR, 1.73
to 2.36), respectively. The results suggest a deceleration in the feminization of the
disease, since the male to female IR between 1980 and 1990 was 6.5:1, and in the period
between 1991 and 2001, it was 2.4:1<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>.</p>
            <p>After smoothing, in 2016, the highest male to female IR was 4.65 reported cases among
males for every 1 reported case among females in the Federal District (where Brasilia is
located, the Federal Capital). There is an expressive difference between this value and
the others, observed in descending order: 3.70 in Belo Horizonte (State of Minas Gerais,
Southeast Region), 3.29 in São Paulo (State of São Paulo, Southeast Region), 3.18 in
Goiânia (State of Goiás, Center-West Region), 3.13 in Juazeiro do Norte (State of Ceará,
Northeast Region), and 3.06 in João Pessoa (State of Paraíba, Northeast Region). In
other regions, the correspondent male to female ratios were lower than 3. With the
exception of Juazeiro do Norte, all these intermediate regions are located in the
corresponding state capitals, which are large urban centers with high population
density.</p>
            <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> shows LISA maps generated for 2012, 2014,
and 2016. This figure is used to identify spatial clusters and examine the
spatiotemporal patterns of the disease incidence. Red colors indicate intermediate
regions with high IR of AIDS whose neighbors have high incidence rates (high-high
spatial correlation), and blue colors indicate intermediate regions with low incidence
rates of AIDS whose neighbors have low incidence rates (low-low spatial correlation).
During the study period, the values of the Moran’s Index (I<sup>2</sup>) confirmed that
the smoothed incidence rates of AIDS for males and females and the male to female IR for
AIDS are spatially heterogeneously distributed across the Brazilian intermediate regions
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>, p values &lt;0.01).</p>
            <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> shows that, considering both male and
female populations, the number of AIDS cases reported in the Northeast Region of Brazil
tends to be higher in the coastal areas, where the most populous cities are located,
than in the noncoastal areas. Additionally, maps in the first and second rows of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> show a large low-low cluster in the
Northeast Region, not including the coastal areas. In contrast, these maps also show a
high-high cluster in the South Region, including mainly the coastal regions of the
States of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, where there is a greater flow of people
and goods. According to the study by Silva-Lizzi et al.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>, higher incidence rates in these Brazilian states in 2006-2012 were also
observed. These authors observed that the subtype C of HIV-1 and C-containing sequences
are highly prevalent in Southern region, mainly in Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul
states, and it is reported that this subtype seems to spread faster than other subtypes
of group M<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>. Additionally, Pereira et al.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> described the burden of AIDS in Rio Grande do Sul as a result of the low state

            <p>The graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> show the association between
GDP per capita and the number of new AIDS cases notified in 2016 among males and
females. The trend lines in the two graphs were obtained from a Bayesian regression
model, and the 95% credible interval (95% CI) for the parameters related to the
association between these variables did not include the zero value, suggesting
significant associations (1.96 among males, 95% CI, 1.53-2.37; 1.67 among females, 95%
CI, 1.22-2.12). These results indicate that the intermediate regions with higher GDP per
capita tend to have higher incidence rates of AIDS than intermediate regions with lower
GDP per capita. However, it is important to remember that the disease is also present in
the North and Northeast regions, which are considered less developed than the Southeast
and South Regions.</p>

            <p>Ecological studies are important in the identification of high-risk areas for a disease.
While the growing AIDS incidence in Brazil<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> requires increasing investments in disease prevention and treatment programs,
the significant variability in HIV epidemic growth patterns among the Brazilian
regions<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> requires new studies that characterize the disease in different regions from the
country according not only to its clinical and epidemiological profile but also to its
social and cultural aspects.</p>
            <p>Interesting results, such as the greater occurrence of the disease in regions with the
highest GDP per capita, point to a reality that is slightly different from that found in
other regions of the world, such as Asia<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>, where AIDS is consistently growing among the impoverished population, with a
lower GDP per capita, a phenomenon known as “pauperization of the epidemic,” which was
registered in Brazil in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This change reflects the
risk behavior and the forms of transmission of HIV<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>

<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>.</p>
            <p>A potential limitation of this study is the quality and completeness of information on
the Brazilian AIDS cases database, which is subject to delays and underreporting. The
dataset used in this study is only available at the aggregate level. However, the
obtained results may be useful as an update of the results of similar studies<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>
