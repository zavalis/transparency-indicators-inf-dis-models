                  <p id="Par1">School testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection has become an important policy and planning issue as schools were reopened after the summer season and as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Decisions to test or not to test and, if testing, how many tests, how often and for how long, are complex decisions that need to be taken under uncertainty and conflicting pressures from various stakeholders.</p>

                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We have developed an agent-based model and simulation tool that can be used to analyze the outcomes and effectiveness of different testing strategies and scenarios in schools with various number of classrooms and class sizes. We have applied a modified version of a standard SEIR disease transmission model that includes symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious populations, and that incorporates feasible public health measures. We also incorporated a pre-symptomatic phase for symptomatic cases. Every day, a random number of students in each class are tested. If they tested positive, they are placed in self-isolation at home when the test results are provided. Last but not least, we have included options to allow for full testing or complete self-isolation of a classroom with a positive case.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">We present sample simulation results for parameter values based on schools and disease related information, in the Province of Ontario, Canada. The findings show that testing can be an effective method in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools if taken frequently, with expedited test results and self-isolation of infected students at home.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par9">Schools bring together a large number of students with very wide social connections and networks in a closed environment where they share spaces, facilities, and equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is argued and expected that reopening and operations of schools may reinforce the virus spread and thus increase the number of cases both in the schools and in the community. Without testing and gradual relaxation of social distancing, a second wave could occur during the school year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, given the importance of learning that takes place inside the schools and the inability of working parents to supervise remote learning at home, there are also concerns regarding school closures and full switch to distant learning. To minimize the impact of the pandemic and to create a safe environment for students while continuing school operations, public health agencies have provided schools with reopening guidelines and procedures that mainly focus on social distancing, hygiene practices, screening and monitoring, and reporting in close collaboration with families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Testing has been an important element of the COVID-19 pandemic management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, while many schools are currently implementing on-site symptom screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], testing may become an additional preventative tool depending on how the pandemic progresses. Testing students prior to and during the school session has become a public health policy and planning issue, as well as a challenge. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), â<italic>a well-implemented testing strategy in school settings might play an important role in preventing virus transmission within the school setting and to the community</italic>â (p.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, because there is no consensus on school testing, because testing is costly and is perceived as painful or uncomfortable, and because it requires significant preparation and planning, it is vital to analyze and assess the outcome and effectiveness of different testing scenarios in controlling disease outbreaks. Simulation modeling can help with exploring and examining the impacts of different testing scenarios. Although testing capacities are currently limited, as technology enhances, it is argued that systematic testing may help in controlling the outbreaks by identifying pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, while allowing schools to continue their activities. This is also in line with arguments that challenge the current testing strategies which focus on testing symptomatic individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This paper describes and presents sample results of an agent-based simulation tool that is developed to help decisionmakers examine different school testing strategies and scenarios. The simulation results are validated with the help of a theoretical viewpoint on the effective reproduction number of the virus in a school environment, which shows that contact tracing, mask wearing and social distancing within classrooms are helping in decreasing the testing frequency and overall test numbers needed to control outbreaks.</p>

                <title>School testing challenges</title>
                <p id="Par11">To test students and staff in elementary and secondary schools, some challenges and issues should be addressed: 1) the need for conducting significant number of tests for finding a small number of infected positive cases; 2) testing, especially frequent swab testing, may cause some pain or discomfort for children-although progress has been made towards less painful tests, such tests are not widely available; 3) almost all currently available tests have significant number of false-negative and false-positive rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] that can cause confusion and stress; 4) tests may create a false sense of security among those tested; 5) conducting regular testing in schools is logistically challenging and requires additional resources, planning and operational burdens; 6) large scale testing of students may add more pressures to local public health testing capacities, and in particular, adding school testing may create more issues and increase waiting time for tests and test results; 7) tests are costly and the current PCR tests require specialized machinery and supply- more tests translates into more costs that need to be justified against the benefits that they generate; 8) the time between collecting a sample and receiving the test results is often too long-currently the test results are available after 1 to 6âdays depending on the type of test and how many tests are being conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], because the main goal of testing is to identify potential carriers and isolate them and those in close contact with them. As the time between sample collection and test results increases, the effectiveness of tests diminishes (For example, in the Province of Ontario, Canada, test results are returned between 1 to 3âdays under normal conditions but this interval can increase to up to a week or even more under busy conditions); 9) public acceptance of mass testing particularly for younger kids in schools is low which may create push back; for example, a study conducted by Statistics Canada found that only 4 in 10 people support mandatory random COVID-19 testing and older adults are more supportive of this idea compared to younger people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; 10) privacy issues may arise in school testing-although the tests results can be kept private, subsequent follow up actions such as the temporary exemption from school, may disclose the identity of infected students. A summary of the challenges above is depicted in TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

                <title>School testing benefits</title>
                <p id="Par12">According to the ECDC (2020) the objectives of school testing are: â<italic>1) to ensure early identification of cases among students and staff in order to conduct contact tracing and initiate prevention and control measures, thereby reducing further transmission; 2) to identify infection in students and staff at high risk of developing severe disease due to underlying conditions; and 3) to support investigations and studies concerning the role of children in the transmission of COVID-19</italic>.â (ECDC, 2020, p. 1). As such, school testing provides some benefits including: 1) more information about the disease status in the community and its subsystems- in the absence of clinical solutions such as a vaccine or a drug, testing enables early detection of infected students and prevents outbreaks, and thus is one of the most powerful tools for managing the pandemic as it allows to identify the infected individuals earlier to reduce additional infections; 2) although testing is uncomfortable and may be painful for some people, it is less painful than hospitalization; 3) testing can reduce pressures on different stakeholders, particularly mental pressures on parents and teachers by providing them with some reassurance that schools are being monitored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; 4) asymptomatic cases, that are mainly among the younger ages and able to spread the virus, can only be detected through random testing; 5) testing enables schools to continue their operations with lower risks and uncertainty: without testing, schools may have to go to lock down more frequently, most likely because when too many cases are identified by screening, it will be too late to control the outbreak without closing the school. Moreover, if the pandemic continues, closure of schools may not be a long-term solution; 6) without regular testing, co-infection or overlap between influenza and COVID-19 can create more chaos, particularly during the flu season when it will be difficult for parents or those who screen the children for symptoms, to identify most likely COVID-19 symptoms. A summary of the challenges above is depicted in TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.

                <title>School testing strategies</title>
                <p id="Par13">Public health agencies are undertaking or considering many different strategies with regard to school testing. These include: 1) Random regular testing in which all or a sample of students and schools are tested regularly: For example, the Province of Saskatchewan, Canada has announced that students with parental consent will have the option to participate in random testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These tests can be integrated into routine in-school childhood vaccinations. Selection of schools to be tested could be based on the surge in communities where schools are located. 2) One-time testing of all students and teachers returning to schools after summer holidays or school closure: This strategy aims to ensure that students come to school uninfected. For example, the Province of Alberta, Canada, aimed to test all students and teachers before reopening the schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This would need prioritization of testing for students and teachers before school reopening. The Province of Saskatchewan also encourages teachers and education staff to get tested prior to the school year; 3) Testing students and teachers with symptoms: this is in line with the current practice in which suspected students and teachers are requested to be tested. Most of the current guidelines provided by Public Health agencies to schools advise them to recommend students or teachers with COVID-19 symptoms to self-quarantine and get tested. According to this strategy, testing does not have to be done in schools, but provisions can be made to give priority to such tests at designated testing sites. TableÂ <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> summarized these different school testing strategies.

                <p id="Par14">In this paper we focus on the first strategy that is based on the regular random testing in all or some of the schools. This strategy could have several options and scenarios depending on the frequency of testing (daily, weekly), number of days it takes to have test results, test expiry days, and actions taken subsequent to positive test results such as intensified testing or self-isolation of infected classes.</p>

              <title>Method</title>
              <p id="Par15">We developed a modeling and simulation tool to assess the outcomes of regular random school testing. We use an agent-based model with two agents of <italic>Student</italic> and <italic>Class</italic>. This model does not include <italic>Teacher</italic> and <italic>Staff</italic>, although the teacher population can be included in the class population adjusting for appropriate contact rates and transmission levels. A modified SEIR model captures the disease transmission (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Students go to their school in the morning of weekdays and return home after the end of the school hours. This movement is captured by the <italic>location</italic> state chart. If a student tested positive, he or she stays home. As shown in the <italic>illness</italic> state chart, each student is at Susceptible state before it is exposed to a random asymptomatic infected classmate. After the exposure, the student may become infectious with different probabilities, either pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic. Transmission rate is defined as a product of <italic>transmission probability</italic> and <italic>number of contacts</italic> when the student resides at school. The model allows for a portion of infected symptomatic cases to be self-isolated. Both asymptomatically and symptomatically infected students recover within a specified number of days. In this model, we have assumed that recovery from the infection would confer lifelong immunity (e.g., within the life span of the modeling), and thus, once an agent is recovered from the infection, it cannot get infected with this virus another time.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Student agent state charts (disease transmission-left, testing-top right and location-bottom right)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2020_10153_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par16">The <italic>testing</italic> state chart captures the testing states of student agent. Students are all in NotTested state before being randomly tested. As students are tested their state changes to Tested. They will remain in this state and the school until the test result is provided. If the test result is positive, the student is self-isolated at home (Quarant state), and if not, the student will go back to NotTested state after the test expiry date and the student can be retested. While in Self Isolated state due to symptoms checking (SIsolated) or due to testing (Quarant) states, students stay at home.</p>
              <p id="Par17">The <italic>Class</italic> agent defines the location of students in the school and infectious status of the class. Each class contains its own students throughout the simulation. In other words, students of each class are always together. Once a student in a class becomes infected, it starts infecting others. As testing starts, a subgroup of the class is created to account for tested students.</p>
              <p id="Par18">The transition from Susceptible to InfectedA state is solely for model initialization that allow us to enter one or more infected students at the beginning or at an arbitrary stage of the modeling process. The initial number of infected students can be decides based on the prevalence rate in the community in which the school is operating.</p>

                  <p id="Par31">In this section we present an estimate on the frequency of testing needed to control outbreaks of COVID-19 in Ontarioâs elementary/secondary schools (ages 5-15âyrs). The testing frequency and number of tests refer to a schoolâs population made up of students &amp; teachers and staff, together. Most importantly, we show that a testing frequency of 3 students per class, per day (as also shown in sections above) is sufficient to keep <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub>ââ¤â1 in the school environment, thus preventing outbreaks. In Humphrey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], a calibrated SEIRL (where L stands for isolated) compartmental model was used to trace the pandemic in various countries. The model gave necessary levels of frequencies for isolating infectious and exposed individuals (via testing and contact tracing) needed to control subsequent waves of the pandemic.</p>
                  <p id="Par32">We use here a similar approach but for a school population as follows: We assume a generic elementary/secondary school in Ontario with a population of students (from junior kindergarten to 8-th grade) denoted by <italic>N</italic><sub>1</sub> and a population of teachers and staff denoted by <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub>. We further denote by subindex-1 the population of students and by subindex-2 the population of teachers &amp; staff. In Prem et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the authors project average numbers of contacts for 152 countries around the world from the POLYMOD study of Mossong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] They refer to social contacts that are meaningful in the transmission of influenza and other similar pathogens. The authors give estimates of the average daily number of contacts of children between ages of 5â15âyears old in Canada with their peers, during school, to be <italic>c</italic><sub>11</sub> =3.46, while the average contact rate of students with their teachers (which we estimate as adults between the ages of 20â65 who work in elementary and secondary school in Ontario) is estimated to be <italic>c</italic><sub>12</sub> =0.39 per day. Using a weighted average mix of 5âyrs. population group sizes in Ontario, we compute the average contact rates of teachers with students to be <italic>c</italic><sub>21</sub> =0.34 and finally the teachers with other teachers rate to be <italic>c</italic><sub>22</sub> =0.31. Since all school contacts take place during school-time (duration 8âh), we obtain the within-school-time contact rate by multiplying the daily number of school contacts by a factor 24Â <italic>hrs</italic>/8Â <italic>hrs</italic>â=â3.</p>

              <p id="Par46">In this simulation we have not included testing accuracy issues that are also very important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Rapid tests that expedite the testing process, if used, may have larger accuracy issues that need to be considered. The relevant parameter can be added to this simulation tool to account for test accuracy level. Similarly, this simulation in its current form does not factor in contact tracing so that if a student test becomes positive, all students in contact with the infected student are self-isolated which probably means the closure of the whole class. This again can be added to this simulation tool. One possibility would be to design the simulation so that if a studentâs test in a class becomes positive all students in that class are tested.</p>
              <p id="Par47">If rapid tests are available, the idea of pool testing can also be incorporated in this model. Pool testing adopts this tree-search algorithm to testing specimen aiming to increase the number of people tested using fewer number of tests. In pool testing, several specimens collected from different people are mixed and one test is done to find if that mix of specimens indicates an infection. In that case, the sources of that mix are divided into two groups, mixing the specimens in two or more different groups, to perform the test on the new â drilled-down mixes â to find which subset(s) of the specimen mixes shows an infection. This drill-down process is continued until the infected specimen(s) is (are) identified.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par49">In this paper, we presented an agent-based simulation tool for COVID-19 testing at schools. The model allows users to set several parameters and investigate the impacts of different testing approaches for controlling the outbreak in schools. The simulation is flexible in allowing different school sizes (based on number of classes and students in each class) and different parameter settings according to the local disease situation and testing policies.</p>
              <p id="Par50">This simulation is not a means for advocating school testing, rather it aims to help making such decisions. By using this tool, public health decisionmakers and school districts officials can decide whether and to what extent school testing would help them to control the outbreak, while being able to calculate the per capita costs of conducting tests at schools.</p>
