                <p>Pandemics have been recognized as a serious global threat to humanity. To effectively prevent the spread and outbreak of the epidemic disease, theoretical models intended to depict the disease dynamics have served as the main tools to understand its underlying mechanisms and thus interrupt its transmission. Two commonly-used models are mean-field compartmental models and agent-based models (ABM). The former ones are analytically tractable for describing the dynamics of subpopulations by cannot explicitly consider the details of individual movements. The latter one is mainly used to the spread of epidemics at a microscopic level but have limited simulation scale for the randomness of the results. To overcome current limitations, a hierarchical hybrid modeling and simulation method, combining mean-field compartmental model and ABM, is proposed in this paper. Based on this method, we build a hybrid model, which takes both individual heterogeneity and the dynamics of sub-populations into account. The proposed model also investigates the impact of combined interventions (i. e. vaccination and pre-deployment training) for healthcare workers (HCWs) on the spread of disease. Taking the case of 2014-2015 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Sierra Leone as an example, we examine its spreading mechanism and evaluate the effect of prevention by our parameterized and validated hybrid model. According to our simulation results, an optimal combination of pre-job training and vaccination deployment strategy has been identified. To conclude, our hybrid model helps informing the synergistic disease control strategies and the corresponding hierarchical hybrid modeling and simulation method can further be used to understand the individual dynamics during epidemic spreading in large scale population and help inform disease control strategies for different infectious disease.</p>

              <p>The rapid spread of an infectious disease can have a devastating impact on humanity, lowering the quality of people’s lives and causing increased mortality. To effectively reduce the epidemic size, considerable studies have been carried out to investigate the mechanism of the infectious disease dynamics and making optimal interventions for controlling epidemic size.</p>
              <p>Mathematical models are tools to study the underlying mechanisms of infectious diseases and to evaluate the impact of interventions towards disease control [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, raised by Kermack and McKendrick [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], is the first epidemic model describing the dynamics of virus transmission among populations. The SIR model, a mean-field compartmental stochastic model, describes the individual mobility at a macroscopic level by separating the epidemic dynamics of sub-populations in patches and connecting them via transmission channels [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This model was further developed by Legrand J et al. by proposing a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model to fit data from the 1995 and 2000 outbreaks in Congo and Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, Berge et al. [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] studied the effect of vaccination and self-protection measures in the transmission dynamics of Ebola in Africa. However, the mean-field compartmental model cannot consider the stochastic nature of the movement of the individual explicitly for it cannot describe the mobility dynamics on individual level.</p>
              <p>One the other hand, the ABM has been widely used to study the epidemic dynamics on the individual level which considers the individual activities such as birth, death, buried, infection, recovery and movement [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. ABM can and has been used to examine how multi-level policies and programs influence population health [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Siettos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] developed an ABM with 6 million individuals interacting through a small-world social network in order to study the EVD in Sierra Leone. However, the randomness of ABM’s output leads to the uncertainty in calibrating parameters and the sophisticated contact network. Therefore, when modeling large scale population, it is tough to gain an insight into the epidemic dynamics through ABM.</p>
              <p>Countermeasures for disease prevention such as aiming at preventing disease transmission have been widely studied in recent years. Some researchers investigated single-focus intervention [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] while other works analyzed combinations of interventions [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Berge T. et al. [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] studied the impact of contact tracing, quarantine and hospitalization on disease dynamics and assessed the efficiency of different given control strategies. Hollingsworth et al. [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] investigated how contact-reducing interventions and availability of antiviral drugs or vaccines contribute to the epidemic dynamics. Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] modeled and evaluated the spread of epidemic with intervention strategies of workforce shift and combination with school closure. With the increased complexity of interventions, the individual behaviour plays an essential role in the epidemic dynamics which cannot be treated by deterministic compartmental models assuming the sub-populations as well-mixed population. However, such a model is yet to be established and this challenge has motivated our study.</p>
              <p>The unprecedented outbreak of Ebola virus disease(EVD), a significant public health problem, in West Africa during 2014–2016 led to 28,638 cases, with 11,316 deaths as of 20 January 2016 [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The World Health Organization(WHO) declared EVD a “public health emergency of international concern” in 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254044.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The current EVD outbreak in West Africa is unprecedented in many ways, including the high number of doctors, nurses, and other health workers who have been infected. Siettos C. et al. [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] developed an ABM to investigate the epidemic dynamics of EVD and provided estimates for key epidemiological variables. Merler S. et al. [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] studied the influence of safe burials procedures, availability of Ebola treatment units and household protection kits by ABM. A new WHO report, investigating the infection of health worker(HCW) has indicated that HCWs are between 21 and 32 times more likely to be infected by Ebola than the general population [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In many epidemics, Healthcare worker(HCW) has been the transmission link to the general population, acting as ‘super-spreaders’ in early epidemics. As they belong to a high-risk and relatively easily identified group, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of healthcare worker-targeted intervention strategies. Vaccination is known as one of the most effective interventions for reducing the morbidity and mortality during the epidemic outbreak. Multiple mathematical modeling analyses aimed to evaluate the impact of vaccination during the outbreak of Ebola epidemics have been undertaken [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Based on their study [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], Merler S. et al. [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] further developed a spatially explicit microsimulation model in order to study the effectiveness of ring vaccination strategies. Besides, pre-deployment training for HCWs also plays an important role in reducing infections. Studies indicate that the low level of knowledge, negative attitude and sub-standard practices can be eliminated through continued training and provision of needed and adequate resources in HCW’s line of duties [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254044.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, few studies have incorporated both prophylactic vaccination strategies and the pre-deployment training strategies into the Ebola dynamic model.</p>
              <p>In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical hybrid modeling and simulation method, coupling SEIR dynamic model and ABM, which takes the advantages of each approach (individual heterogeneity for ABM and population size and reliable output for SEIR model) into consideration. Based on the characteristic of Ebola virus transmission in West Africa, we consider the problem of how to study the epidemic dynamics in the entire region while the individual heterogeneity is also considered. We develop a hybrid model based on the hierarchical structure to simulate the dynamics of Ebola epidemic and evaluate the impact of intervention strategies. Different vaccination and training strategies targeted to HCWs are incorporated into the proposed hybrid model so as to provide optimal interventions. The published data by WHO for 2014–2015 epidemic in Sierra Leone are used for validation and the recommended vaccination and training interventions are given for the prevention of the spread of disease.</p>
              <p>Our work makes three contributions. Firstly, we propose a hierarchical hybrid modeling and simulation method which constructs infectious disease transmission dynamics at different scales. The “macroscopic” model (based on SEIR model) describes the size of the general population in the affected area and the “microscopic” model (based on ABM) describes how multi-level policies and programs shape population health. Secondly, we build an extended SEIR dynamic model based on the newly raised hierarchical modeling method and take into account both vaccination and training strategies on HCWs to better understand the dynamics of Ebola epidemic and its treatment. Thirdly, we reveal the essential characteristic of the impact of combined interventions on EVD transmission, extending the previous work by taking synergistic strategies into account.</p>
              <p>The content of this paper is organized as follows. “Methods” describes the proposed hierarchical hybrid modeling and simulation method and its corresponding hybrid model analyzing the dynamics of disease transmission during the 2014 EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone. “Results” presents the validation results of our proposed model and studies the effects of combined interventions. “Discussion” illustrates our conclusion, the comparison between the previous work corresponding to intervention strategies and our hybrid model and the future work based on our present study.</p>

                <p>The epidemic of Ebola in Sierra Leone was simulated and validated using both specific disease characteristic parameters derived from literature researches and the parameters estimated by simultaneously minimizing the squared differences between the model output of infectious cases and the cases reported by WHO for the 2014 epidemic as reported [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254044.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The simulation period (from May 12, 2014 to November 13, 2015) is divided into three phases (first period: May 12, 2014 to September 12,2014 a total of 123 days, second period: September 12,2014 to November 18,2014, a total of 67 days, third period: November 19,2014 to November 13, 2015, a total of 360 days) according to the growth trend of reported cases. The reported data is shown in <xref rid="pone.0254044.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. In the first 123 days, a sharpen increase in the reported Ebola cases among HCWs per month and a slight increase per week in reported cases among overall population are shown. In the second period (123 to 190 days) the new cases among HCWs decreased and the new cases among the overall population show rapid increase. In the third period (190 to 550 days), both cases among HCWs and the overall population decrease (<xref rid="pone.0254044.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Hybrid modeling and simulation method and the model</title>
                <p>Traditional epidemiological models are ‘susceptible, exposed, infected, and removed (SEIR)’ model or its variants. SEIR model or its variants picture the epidemic dynamics inadequately as continuous deterministic processes and strongly simplified the representation of social activities. However, considering the impact of intervention strategies in the emergency response, the disease transmission dynamic model needs to add up details for individual activities. We propose a hybrid modeling and simulation method combining ABM and SEIR dynamic. In our method, epidemiological model based on SEIR framework is used at the macro level, inside which agents are modeled at the micro level using ABM. The mobility dynamic of sub-populations is described on the macro level while the individual heterogeneity is shown in the micro level. An illustration of the ABM method based on SEIR in the hybrid model is presented in <xref rid="pone.0254044.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. Our method handles stochastic events such as vaccination and pre-deployment training and continuous processes like the spread of virus at the same time. The global model runs in hybrid time with epidemic dynamics calculated in continuous time, and individual state changes and their related processes (training, vaccination stage, decision to work) occurring as discrete asynchronous events.</p>

                <p>Based on this hybrid modeling and simulation method, we build a detailed hybrid model to investigate the epidemic dynamics of EVD in Sierra Leone, study the effect of interventions (vaccination and education) on HCW and provide recommendations for potential future health-related emergency responses for the government. The hybrid model can reproduce the viability of a HCW in a heterogeneous environment by coupling a decision making submodel in ABM, with a contact infection model in SEIR model.</p>

                  <p>According to [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the study expend the general SEIR model which separates susceptible group into susceptible HCW and susceptible general population. In our study, we introduce a related but also new model with a difference. In our SEIR model, we use a similar structure as [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Eight compartments in the model, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0254044.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, categorize the total population in Sierra Leone. The population in each individual compartment at any given point in time has been estimated by accounting for the inflows and outflows into the compartment. In addition to the general SEIR model, the sub-population “susceptible(S)” are separated into “susceptible HCW” and “susceptible general population” as shown in <xref rid="pone.0254044.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. In addition, the “susceptible HCW” has been modeled in a deeper level by ABM and its detail is described in “Agent-based model” part.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, Susceptible individuals (S) may be Exposed (E) to virus after contact with an infectious individual and become Infectious (I) after the incubation of virus, being capable of infecting others. Some of the infected individuals may be Hospitalized (H). The unhospitalized patients in I and the hospitalized patients in H will be in one of two states: be dead(D), with capacity of infecting others before going through safe burials procedures or holding funerals (F), or they may recover(R). The transmissions and the ordinary differential equations describing this model are listed in the <xref rid="pone.0254044.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>.</p>

                  <p>ABM is a microscopic modeling method and its benefits can be summarized as followed: i. ABM can describe emergent phenomena; ii. ABM descrides system in a natural way; and iii. ABM’s flexibility. In our study, multiple interventions such as education and vaccination need to be considered [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The HCW’s state of change is nonlinear and can be depicted by chance or if-then rules. It is difficult to describing discontinuity in individual behavior with aggregate flow equations. Therefore, ABM is used for its ability to deal with such system. Besides, ABM describes and simulates our system in a natural way. In our ABM, each parameter had intuitive meaning and the adjustment of the value has guiding significance to government policy making. We do not generate social-transmission network in ABM for we only focus on the uninfected HCWs who do not contribute to virus transmission and the contact infection is considered in the SEIR model.</p>
                  <p>In order to study the effect of interventions on HCWs, we assume the susceptible HCWs (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">HCW</italic></sub>) as “agents” in order to study their behavior towards the given interventions. As in <xref rid="pone.0254044.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, ABM is applied to gain an insight into the group of S<sub><italic toggle="yes">HCW</italic></sub> in the SEIR dynamic model. Each agent has an associated social state related to their reaction towards education or vaccination interventions. The agent makes decisions depending on its current condition. The output of the ABM is the number of exposed HCWs calculated by the information gathered in the SEIR model. And the exposed HCWs, in return, join in the dynamics of virus transmission in the SEIR model.</p>

                  <p>In the education module, HCWs are separated into several types according to their academic certificate and their willingness to work. The arrows in <xref rid="pone.0254044.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> represent the possible transitions and their shifting mechanism follows the rules presented in the earlier study [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We mainly focus on the pre-deployment training which prepared for HCW in the Ebola affected area. Other factors which represent the situation of education are also considered in the ABM. We specifically designate the parameters that represent the amount of schooling (professional training for HCWs) as several decision making processes (diamond shapes in <xref rid="pone.0254044.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) and their corresponding transition rate P1-P3. The meaning and value of these three parameters are described in Table 2. Here, we focus on the rate of P3 which explains the coverage of pre-deployment training among HCWs.</p>
                  <p>At the first stage of the state chart(<xref rid="pone.0254044.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>), those who had knowledge of EVD before the outbreak turn into “Initial Ebola Education” state while others turn into the state of “Novice”. At the second stage of the state chart, those who have knowledge of EVD before the outbreak attend intensive training according to the transmission rate “P2” while those who have low level of knowledge attend the pre-deployment training according to the transmission rate “P3”. After these two stages, those who do not attend the training would be “unprotected” and eventually come to the “Exposed” state after a incubation period of 2 to 21 days of the Ebola virus while working in health facilities. Those who attend the training move to the “trained” state and thus carry out appropriate precaution and take the initiative to get vaccination.</p>
                  <p>HCWs who have been intensively trained (HCWs who were in the “Trained” state) move into the vaccination module (<xref rid="pone.0254044.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) according to the vaccine penetration rate. The two modules are connected though the state of “trained” as shown in <xref rid="pone.0254044.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>. As mentioned in model assumption, only the “trained” HCWs can further turn into the vaccination state. Considering the vaccine characteristic which includes the onset of protection and the duration of protection, agents in this phase are separated into several states: i. HCWs who have already vaccinated but the efficacy of vaccine has not been onset yet (V1), ii. HCWS who are protected by the effective vaccine (V2), iii. Vaccinated HCWs revert to susceptible state after the efficiency of vaccine (remain in the state “Trained”). The transformation rules of these three states follow the vaccine characteristics. The main transition paths are listed as followed:</p>

                <p>The parameters fitted to the published data by WHO for 2014–2015 epidemic in Sierra Leone can be seen in Tables <xref rid="pone.0254044.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0254044.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Parameters in the ABM are fixed and their values are determined as close to reality as possible according to the prior knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, the free parameters (“Fitted” parameters listed in <xref rid="pone.0254044.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) that require calibration are in the SEIR dynamic model. We develop the hybrid model using the multi-method simulation software AnyLogic Professional (version 8.3.1) [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and perform calibration by “Calibration Experiment” in AnyLogic. The daily new cases and deaths in the overall population were used for calibration. Through calibration experiment, the difference between the simulation output and the given data is calculated with the help of the “difference” function. The integration range is the intersection of argument ranges of the two datasets. The “difference” function returns a non-negative value which is a square root of the average of square of difference between sets of data. By running 3000 iterations of the calibration experiment, we obtain the minimal value and the corresponding parameters, as it means the least difference between two sets of data. In addition, we set fixed intervals for the free parameters during calibration referring to the parameters reported by Potluri R. [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>

Considering the group of HCWs, the mean model outputs show 312 cases compared to 299 cases reported by WHO. The basic reproduction number R0 for this hybrid model is 1.30(1.26 ≤ <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>0 ≤ 2.53) which is consistent to the reported estimation of R0 for the 2014 Sierra Leone epidemic in the earlier work [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>

                <p>To evaluate the impact of pre-deployment training, <xref rid="pone.0254044.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> shows cumulative infected population under different coverage rate of pre-deployment training among HCWs. Additionally, although the value of P3 in the initial case may not precisely reveal the real situation, the bias of P3 has little impact on our study for we mainly focus on the trend rather than the specific value. It can be seen that i. a small increase of the number of HCW (95% to 96% HCW) getting pre-deployment training can help reduce 31.93% cases and 31.85% deaths among the overall population (<xref rid="pone.0254044.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). ii. About 10% of Ebola cases and deaths among general population can be reduced by 1% increase in the coverage of pre-deployment training for HCW. iii. Enhancing the education for the frontline HCW can have a positive impact on the disease prevention.</p>

                <p>The efficiency of vaccination also depends on the time estimated for completing vaccinations among certain group. However, the duration time of vaccinating the certain group is also influenced by the infrastructural challenges, the time the vaccination taken for onset of protection and also the degree of dispersion of the people who need vaccination.</p>
                <p>Comparing to the previous study result that effective EVD vaccination rates were estimated to be 42% for the overall population [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], our study shows that only 10% HCWs (0.00016% of the whole population) get vaccination can be effective. The simulation results indicate that i. vaccination of a small proportion of populations can effectively reduce the size of epidemic. Also, vaccinating HCWs can be seen as an effective method to eliminate virus transmission channels between HCWs and the infected people. ii. The aversion rates in <xref rid="pone.0254044.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> show that vaccination of 30% and 50% HCW have similar effect. This result indicates that the effects of vaccination on HCW are limited with the expansion of vaccination coverage. iii. Considering the efficiency of vaccination, vaccination of 30% HCW is recommended.</p>

                <p>In contrast, vaccination of 50% of HCW with 96% HCW getting trained results in an aversion of 70.54% cases which means that only 3.27% cases can be averted by increasing 40% HCW to get vaccination. Comparing with the without education intervention scenarios, 53.58% of cases can be averted when 10% of HCW get vaccination while 62.48% of cases can be averted with 30% vaccination proportion. A 8.9% increase is seen between the ‘10% vaccination’ scenario and ‘30% vaccination’ scenario. With the further increase of the coverage of pre-deployment training, the downward shift in the overall Ebola cases and deaths becomes less pronounced among the vaccination rate of 10%, 30% and 50%.</p>
                <p>Based on <xref rid="pone.0254044.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>, Tables <xref rid="pone.0254044.t005" ref-type="table">5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0254044.t006" ref-type="table">6</xref>, there are several conclusions to be made concerning these results. i. The combination of interventions for Ebola prevention and protection is more effective than the single intervention. ii. Although the combination of interventions is seen to add substantial benefit to the epidemic prevention and protection, the efficiency of expanding vaccination coverage shows a decline when the education strategies are implemented simultaneously. iii. Unlike the recommended strategies given in the “Impact of vaccination strategies”, vaccination of 10% of HCW can achieve a higher efficiency than vaccination of 30% of HCW. In other word, with the intervention of expanding the coverage of pre-deployment training for HCW, 10% of vaccination rate is recommended in the process of Ebola epidemic prevention and protection.</p>

              <title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
              <p>Given that analysis mentioned above, we draw the following conclusions: i. The hybrid modeling and simulation method we propose in this work can be used to construct the hybrid simulation method model based on the specific epidemic case. ii. The hybrid simulation model fits the dynamics of 2014–2015 Ebola epidemic outbreak in Sierra Leone. iii. Our proposed hybrid model can simulate the implementation of synergistic interventions which effectively slow down the spread of epidemic. iv. Vaccination of 10% HCW in addition to intensified training on HCWs during the outbreak has a significant impact and the further increase of the vaccination rate results in little improvement.</p>
              <p>Our model combines differential equations for the virus transmission among subpopulations in the epidemic affected area and ABM for the management of HCWs. Such muti-scale modeling method was also used in meta-population dynamics modeling [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In order to minimize the randomness raised by ABM, we build the ABM for a small group of people who are targeted to the interventions and have a significant impact on disease dynamics. Our model depicts the individual details selectively and keeps the structure of the SEIR model which ensures the ability to model in large scale population. Additionally, the number of HCWs be exposed plays the role of linking between the two modeling level. This model, engaging various dynamics at different scales, outlines a promising method for large-scale system modeling. The combination of SEIR model and ABM has many advantages: i. Intuitive dynamic representation by using data acquired in the real world and modeling at different scales (e.g., spatial scales and temporal scales). [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] ii. Modeling individual activities, rare events and the virus transmission process with large scale population. Compared with the earlier studies of modelling the epidemic dynamics, our model overcomes the following difficulties: i. The processes occurring at different scales, individual activities, rare events, sophisticated population structure must be altogether taken into account [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] in the real landscape. However, the traditional SEIR framework-based models or its variants based on differential equations [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254044.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254044.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] assuming a well-mixed population have difficulty to gain an insight of the model details. ii. The computational difficulty of modeling large scale population (7017144 people were taken into account in our study).</p>
              <p>The hybrid model proposed in our study provides a reliable method that helps to analyze the impact of healthcare workers related policies and give efficient combination strategies aiming to protect the high-risk populations against Ebola virus. Comparing our modeling result with other epidemic model which analyzed the intervention policies implemented for disease control and prevention, our work illustrates new findings in the presence of consistent conclusions with the earlier works. Ebola cases reported from Sierra Leone in HCWs represented a much higher estimated cumulative incidence in HCWs than in non-HCWs [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] which lead to a high efficiency of HCW-targeted vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Robert A et al. used a mathematical transmission model to explore the relative contribution of HCW and the community to transmission and claimed that ahead-of-time vaccination for 30% of HCW is effective for disease control [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] which is consistent to our conclusion given for the case that only vaccination strategies are considered. Besides, we also take into account the intervention of education and lead to the conclusion that vaccination of 10% HCW can be effective when pre-job training for HCW is also considered, corresponding to the statement that the achievement of one policy objective may preclude success with others [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Alexis Robert’s et al. predicted that 10% of HCW getting prophylactic vaccination would result in 7685 cases and 3155 deaths and 30% of HCW getting vaccination would result in 5776 cases and 2358 [<xref rid="pone.0254044.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] compared with our model output 6709 cases and 1987 deaths with 10% vaccination rate and 5425 cases and 1611 deaths with 30% vaccination rate. The difference between these two output mainly owing to the difference in the validation data. In our study, we do not differentiate between confirmed, probable and suspected cases and regard them as cases in our model for the SEIR model does not explicitly distinguish these three type of cases. Alexis Robert’s model only considered the confirmed cases. However, our study come to a similar conclusion for vaccination strategies for the tend of the impact of vaccination are similar in these two models. Our model can be seen as an extension or a calibration for the earlier study.</p>
              <p>We have identified several improvements that can be made which can be further studied. Firstly, the infected HCWs and the infected general population were assumed to be homogeneous in our study. In the real world, this assumption cannot be held fully which may lead to a bias between the model output and the real data. Secondly, the relation between vaccination policy and education policy is much more sophisticated in the real world than that in our model. The coupling relationship between these two policies can be further investigated.</p>
              <p>To conclude, our hybrid simulation model successfully presents the dynamics of EVD transmission in Sierra Leone and evaluates the impact of different interventions. Our hybrid modeling and simulation method can be applied to understand the individual dynamics during epidemic spreading in large scale population. Besides, such models with heterogeneous human mobility can help inform disease control strategies for different infectious disease.</p>

              <p>A hybrid simulation model to study the impact of combined interventions on Ebola epidemic</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Chen,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Both reviewers agree that the presentation of the work needs more elaboration and the use of English should be considerably improved. One of the reviewers is particularly critical on the work, thus raising major issues about the model. The criticisms are mainly focused on the review of the literature and importantly  on the presentation of both models (mean field and agent-based one) and the lack of information concerning the statistical analysis of the results and the algorithms used for calibration purposes.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Apr 16 2021 11:59PM.

              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors present a hybrid Agent-based model coupled with a compartmental SEIR model to describe the dynamics of the 2014-2015 Ebola in Sierra Leone. Based on the models, they study the effects of health care training and vaccination strategies.</p>
              <p>Minor</p>
              <p>- Line 16: should be Legrand not Legramd</p>
              <p>- The authors use the term “system dynamics model” for SEIR models. The usual term used for such models is compartmental or mechanistic dynamical models. I don’t insist that they change the terminology, but this is more appropriate.</p>
              <p>- The authors should elaborate more in the use of English. There are several syntactical errors.</p>
              <p>Major</p>
              <p>1. Line 18: “Furthermore, Tsanou et al. [9] studied the potential impact of 18environmental prophylactic vaccine” The word vaccine is misleading and should NOT be used in that way. Tsanou et al. studied the effect of environmental contamination and how adequate hygienic living conditions could affect the spread.</p>
              <p>2. Line 20: following up the previous statement they state that “However, the stochastic nature of the movement of the individual is not considered explicitly with SDM for they only describe the mobility dynamics of sub-populations [10].” This sentence is vague and needs more elaboration. What do they mean with “for they only describe the mobility dynamics of sub-populations?” The model in Tsanou it is a compartmental model and not an individual-based model? This is what they mean?</p>
              <p>3. Line 27. The authors state “However, it is tough to gain an insight of the epidemic dynamics 27with vole populations through ABM due to the massive calculations.”. The main difficulty when using ABM is not the massive calculations, but (1) the uncertainty in calibrating the many parameters and variables, the connection to the compartmental sub-group scale in a systematic way, the uncertainty in modeling the underlying high dimensional contact network. Computational cost is secondary.</p>
              <p>4. A general comment about the review of the literature: There is a huge literature in epidemiology about agent-based models that have been used for various purposes. A relatively small subgroup of these have been developed for describing the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. They authors cite only a very small number of papers related to agent-based modelling but also not related to the epidemic of Ebola. Thus they have to elaborate more on the review of the existing literature, and they have to cite and discuss key papers that have introduced agent-based models that have focused on the Ebola dynamics. e.g. (in chronological order)</p>

              <p>5. The description of the modelling approach needs a lot of improvement. Actually the agent-based model is only described by a schematic and a table at the supporting information containing the transitions in the micro level.</p>
              <p>6. Many of the parameters in the table of the SI appear as ad-hoc (70% possibility etc). These values can be justified.</p>
              <p>7. The authors should describe this in detail. A prominent characteristic of agent-based models is the underlying social-transmission network. There is no such information in the presentation of the model. Without such a heterogeneity, i.e. when the interactions are uniform and random, an agent –based mode can be easily be substituted by a mean field model.</p>
              <p>8. The same hold true for the calibration. There is no information about the algorithm that has been used to fit the parameters of the model and because of the fact that the agent-based model is not well described</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Please refer to annotated attached file for my comments on the manuscript.</p>
              <p>I believe the manuscript is worth investigating, but the English level is not good. The authors need to use short and precise sentences to express in a comprehensible manner their mind. Few technical questions mentioned on my report (the annotated attached manuscript) need to be answered rigorously for the overall manuscript to be more interesting and reader-friendly.</p>

              <p>A hybrid simulation model to study the impact of combined interventions on Ebola epidemic</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Chen,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>While both reviewers agree that you have accomodated most of their comments, and one of the two reviewers recommended the acceptance of your manuscript, the second reviewer has still some major comments that you have to adress before the final acceptance of you manuscript. In particular, the reviewer recommends that you should report the confidence intervals in your figures where appropriate; the second issue is about the way that you have calibrated your data.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jul 09 2021 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
              <p>
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p>
                  </list-item>
                </list>
              </p>
              <p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
              <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Kind regards,</p>

              </p>
              <p>1. If the authors have adequately addressed your comments raised in a previous round of review and you feel that this manuscript is now acceptable for publication, you may indicate that here to bypass the “Comments to the Author” section, enter your conflict of interest statement in the “Confidential to Editor” section, and submit your "Accept" recommendation.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: All comments have been addressed</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>2. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Partly</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>3. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: N/A</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>6. Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors tried to address most of my comments in an adequate way. However, still the manuscript cannot be published in its current form. The authors should</p>
              <p>1. work more on improving the quality of the figures (in the PDF version the quality of resolution is rather low) and importantly report and overlay the e.g. 95% confidence intervals in all relevant figures (figures for the cumulative ebola cases, deaths, etc, impact of pre-job training etc, impact of prophylactic vaccination.</p>
              <p>2. Please make clear, what data have been used for calibration: on the cumulative or the new cases (at least for the deaths and recovered)?. It is known that a calibration based on long series of cumulative data can bias the confidence intervals of estimations. So it is better that the calibration is made on the new cases (see also the discussion in King et al. Avoidable errors in the modelling of outbreaks of emerging pathogens, with special reference to ebola, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 282 (1806) (2015) 20150347.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors made sufficient efforts to address satisfactorily all my concerns. The paper is now very nice, well writing and suitable for publication.</p>
              <p>**********</p>

If published, this will include your full peer review and any attached files.</p>
              <p>If you choose “no”, your identity will remain anonymous but your review may still be made public.</p>
