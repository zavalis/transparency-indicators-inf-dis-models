                  <title>Simple Summary</title>
                  <p>A modified SIR model was applied to provide COVID-19 pandemic analysis and predictions for Gulf Cooperation Council countries, as well as representative countries in Europe and New York City. We estimated reported, infected, and unreported cases from cumulative reported cases and simulated data. We also estimated the basic reproduction rates at different phases of the pandemic. Outputs show that the modified SIR model fits very well with the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic for the studied countries and could be generalized to other countries. The model prediction emphasizes the value of significant interventions in public health in regulating the epidemic taking into account that a constant fraction of the infected cases remain unreported during the pandemic. We report and analyze the effectiveness of preventive/intervention measures applied to the overall community to curb the severity of the pandemic. Our model could be used to support public health authorities with respect to post-outbreak reopening decisions, highlighting effective measures that need to be maintained, eased, or implemented to support safe reopening strategies in the GCC countries.</p>

                  <p>Epidemiological Modeling supports the evaluation of various disease management activities. The value of epidemiological models lies in their ability to study various scenarios and to provide governments with a priori knowledge of the consequence of disease incursions and the impact of preventive strategies. A prevalent method of modeling the spread of pandemics is to categorize individuals in the population as belonging to one of several distinct compartments, which represents their health status with regard to the pandemic. In this work, a modified SIR epidemic model is proposed and analyzed with respect to the identification of its parameters and initial values based on stated or recorded case data from public health sources to estimate the unreported cases and the effectiveness of public health policies such as social distancing in slowing the spread of the epidemic. The analysis aims to highlight the importance of unreported cases for correcting the underestimated basic reproduction number. In many epidemic outbreaks, the number of reported infections is likely much lower than the actual number of infections which can be calculated from the model’s parameters derived from reported case data. The analysis is applied to the COVID-19 pandemic for several countries in the Gulf region and Europe.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>The first known COVID-19 case was reported by officials in Wuhan City, China, on 31 December 2019. Following that date, the number of confirmed infectious cases was on the rise. Consequently, on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic [<xref rid="B1-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The recorded cases of COVID-19 have increased exponentially worldwide since then, reaching more than 100 million confirmed cases in 191 countries and more than two million deaths globally. As of 23 January 2021, the outbreak has had an effect on 7,119,570 people in the Middle East, and 1,181,199 confirmed cases have been reported in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries according to the Worldometers website <uri xlink:href="www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</uri> (accessed on 1 April 2020). A national emergency was declared for the Coronavirus outbreak in Qatar at the beginning of March 2020 [<xref rid="B2-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and by 23 January 2021, the number of cases reported in Qatar had already reached 148,772 cases. Following the announcement of COVID-19 as a pandemic, most of the Gulf countries scaled up their responses and put in place rigorous controls [<xref rid="B3-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; the declaration of a pandemic generally leads to governments spending more on preventive measures and funding for vaccination programs.</p>
              <p>Given the gravity of the situation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, a fundamental and yet critical question remains unanswered: how many people are currently infected with COVID-19 in the GCC countries and what is the actual value of the basic reproduction number? During the first few months of the outbreak, only a sub-sample of individuals with significant symptoms or travel history could be assessed by hospitals and disease control centers because of the shortage in testing kits; the number of recorded infections is probably much lower than the actual number of infections, particularly early in the course of the pandemic [<xref rid="B3-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These unreported infections can, indeed, remain unnoticed, since they often have mild or no symptoms, which can be confused with seasonal flu, for example. If not hospitalized or quarantined, unreported COVID-19 carriers could infect a large proportion of the population, posing genuine difficulties for contact tracing measures and the pandemic’s overall containment. Accordingly, in order to determine the efficacy of preventive measures such as quarantine and social distancing, calculating the number of unreported infections will serve to notify policymakers about the correct scale of virus control policies, school closing, mask-wearing, etc., in slowing down the spread of the epidemic [<xref rid="B7-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>Ideally, a randomized testing experiment would offer an impartial estimation of the infection fatality rate. However, given the limited availability of test kits and the rising demand among people with symptoms, randomized testing, especially in the early periods of the outbreak, may not be feasible. Therefore, it may be of great benefit to estimate and to be able to measure the fraction of unreported infections with observational data on hand. Policymakers will be better prepared to enforce the required degree and duration of virus control policies with this information.</p>
              <p>The estimation of results based on model analysis for GCC countries reveals that the basic reproduction number may be as high as 8.9 (95% CI 1.71–8.98) [<xref rid="B9-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the strict controls put in place can effectively decrease the basic reproduction number and the risk of contagiousness, with the impact of travel restrictions on COVID-19 infection in Qatar being almost equal to raising the baseline value of quarantine by 100 thousand baseline value.</p>
              <p>As a result, it is critical at this point to accurately assess the reported and unreported infected cases, as this is critical in estimating the basic reproduction number correctly. This would also assist the GCC countries in general, and the Qatari authorities in particular, in evaluating the economic and societal consequences of implementing resource-intensive preventive measures such as the closure of borders, critical businesses, and educational institutions, quarantine, social distancing, the mandatory wearing of protective masks, and upgrading medical tools and equipment. All the above measures have been proven to be efficient for the prevention and the control of the COVID-19 infection, but come with a sizable economic and societal burden, making it essential to continuously evaluate how long these measures should be maintained to lower the infection rate and to prevent the collapse of the country’s health care system.</p>

              <p>Typically, reported cases represent a subset of the total number of infected cases, as sometimes only the most severe cases of symptoms are reported. On the basis of Liu et al.

                <title>2.1. Parameters of the Model</title>
                <p>Our model uses a compartment for unstated or unreported cases, which is very important when modeling several pandemics. Recent studies have shown that it is important to estimate this number. Saxa et al., 2020 [<xref rid="B21-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed that only 2.4% of the cases in India were being reported (i.e., an understatement factor of about 42). Wu et al., 2020 [<xref rid="B22-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported that the actual number of infections was estimated to be 3 to 20 times higher than the confirmed cases for various states of the United States of America. Lu et al., 2020 [<xref rid="B23-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] showed that there were drastic cases of underreporting in many countries worldwide.</p>
                <p>Therefore, for policymakers to effectively develop strategies for resource distribution, intervention implementation, and promotion of public awareness, accurate predictions of the magnitude and the development of an epidemic are needed.</p>
                <p>To develop adequate and valuable modeling, we adapted simple and complementary SIR differential models, which were originally proposed by Bernoulli [<xref rid="B24-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and adapted by Liu et al., 2020 [<xref rid="B6-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Most pandemics follow a non-Markovian mechanism, which means that the past states of dynamical systems lead to the current states, which is referred to as “memory” [<xref rid="B25-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, previous knowledge of the prevalence of an outbreak and precautions are not always available or disseminated, and thus people prefer to adopt new approaches to address the disease [<xref rid="B26-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Here, instead of using continuous time evolution differential equations, we focused on a time-discrete Markovian process, using the widely applied assumption that days are a natural unit of measurement [<xref rid="B30-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This was described using a Markov epidemic process, in which the state of individuals at each time step does not depend on the previous steps.

                <p>Based on the reported cases R, this approach recaptures the number of unreported cases U that were not accounted for as a result of factors such as their being asymptomatic or mild cases, unreported contamination, or the mobility of infected individuals (especially at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak) in the GCC. We complemented this with the model of Demongeot et al. [<xref rid="B31-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which accounts for the birth/death rate since the onset of the pandemic in late winter 2019, and which has continued to surge, with a second wave hitting northern hemisphere countries in fall 2020/winter 2021.

Furthermore, we assume that the removal rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm22"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ν</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the sum of the recovery numbers of the reported and unreported cases, following the form <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm23"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ν</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>ν</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>ν</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm24"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ν</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>is the removal rate of reported infected individuals and <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm25"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ν</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the removal rate of infected individuals due to all other causes, such as mortality, recovery or other reasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00463-f002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
                <p>To the best of our knowledge, there have been a limited number of articles published on the prediction and the calculation of the basic reproduction number <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm26"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Middle East, and particularly in the GCC countries, especially with the inclusion of the unreported cases parameter in SIR. Rahman et al. (2020) [<xref rid="B35-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] used a classic SIR model with least-square error, and reported the <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> values for Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman to be 2.71, 3.39, 4.18, 4.45, 2.75, 2.60, respectively. Al-Shammari et al. (2020) [<xref rid="B36-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] used a dynamic transmission SEIR model for Kuwait that was informed by two local mechanisms: a delay period during which suspected COVID-19 individuals are tested, identified, and hospitalized; and different severities of illness. They calibrated the model with a maximum likelihood framework and produced an <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> ranging between 1.5 and 3.5.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Al Wahaibi et al. (2020) [<xref rid="B37-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] proposed a probabilistic model for modeling dynamic <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> in Oman. They fitted a Gamma distribution to the susceptible cases and used a Poisson likelihood estimation to capture the transmission of the infection. Their estimated <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> ranged between 0.9 and 4.65, depending on the non-pharmaceutical intervention period between February and June. Billah et al. (2020) [<xref rid="B38-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] used a meta-analysis model and estimated the <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> to be 2.87.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the GCC population has a combination of unique characteristics when compared to countries from the northern hemisphere, such as high fertility (birth), a young population, and the high prevalence of diseases such as diabetes. Advanced numbers estimation based on model analysis without considering unreported cases for countries in the Middle East reveals that the basic reproduction number may be as high as 8.9 (95% CI 1.71–8.98) (see [<xref rid="B39-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]).</p>
                <p>The first stage of the analysis is to note that Model (2) presents a properly posed problem. This is a model in dimensionless time t. It this way, <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm27"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ν</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> becomes a dimensionless parameter. Since <italic>I</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is integrable on [0, ∞), I(∞) = 0.</p>
                <p>That is, since <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm28"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∂</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>S/<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm29"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∂</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>t <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm30"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> 0 if <italic>S</italic> = 0 and <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm31"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∂</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>I/<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm32"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∂</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>t <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm33"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> 0 if <italic>I</italic> = 0, we have <italic>S</italic> <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm34"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> <italic>I</italic> <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm35"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, for <italic>t</italic> <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm36"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Meanwhile, here, we focus on their assessment on the basis of the reported symptomatic-and-infectious cases.</p>
              <p>We assume that<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm87"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>ν</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> can be between one day and seven days. This is the average time during which infected cases are asymptomatic. In addition, we set <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm88"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> as between one day and seven days, for the average time during which an infected case is symptomatic. Finally, we identified them, assuming that between 80% and 100% of infectious cases were reported. Accordingly, the <italic>f</italic> value was set between 0.8 and 1. Thus, we fixed <italic>f</italic>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm89"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm90"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ν</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm91"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm92"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm93"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. Using Equation (7) for the basic reproduction number, we obtained from the data an estimation of the basic reproduction number <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm94"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2.42</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and an average <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm95"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in the GCC, which was 2.20 <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm96"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mn>0.123</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p>

For example, for Qatar <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm101"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>7.1</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>8</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm102"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>10.1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm103"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm104"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2.42</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. The average transmission rate for GCC was [3.55 <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm105"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mn>3.53</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>8</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p>
              <p>We also plotted the graphs of <italic>t</italic> → <italic>C</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) (solid black line), <italic>t</italic> → <italic>U</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) (blue dotted), and <italic>t</italic> → <italic>R</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) (red dotted) for Qatar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00463-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The turning point was defined as the time at which the red curve reached its maximum value (i.e., the curve of the unaccumulated recorded infectious cases) of between 1500 and 2000 (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00463-f004">Figure 4</xref>) and that the turning point was day 109, which was 5 July. The turning point for the UAE was day 100, which corresponds to June 1st, since the UAE was the first country in the Middle East to report a confirmed case of COVID-19 (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biology-10-00463">Figures S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Information SI</xref>).</p>
              <p>Interestingly, although there are different kinetics as per the fitted parameters (<xref rid="biology-10-00463-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), the fraction of unreported cases was similar among the examined countries/city. This assessment supports the notion that transmission rate reduction is more effective than the disclosure of unreported cases. Subsequently, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00463-f005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00463-f006">Figure 6</xref> show the dynamics of the pandemic with several interventions. For example, the number of reported cases drops by <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm109"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>if we use a 14% intervention (with the transmission rate decreasing from 7.1 to 6.1 at the <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm110"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>8</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> scale) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00463-f005">Figure 5</xref>), and that a moderate measure of intervention significantly mitigates the final scale of the epidemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00463-f006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
              <p><italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> represents the average number of people infected by one infectious individual when there is zero immunity in the population. While we recall the strict isolation steps imposed for all of Qatar and the GCC countries in March 2020 [<xref rid="B45-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and we take into consideration the number of unstated cases, the corrected estimate was between two and three for Qatar. This assessment is much lower than the reported values. Let us consider <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm121"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> as the effective reproduction rate resulting from the inclusion of intervention. It is crucial to estimate <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm122"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> regularly to decide whether to ease off or to make the preventive measures stricter. At the same time, we should account for the acquired immunity within the population and the level of preventative measures being implemented to accurately assess <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm123"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. Therefore, our proposed approach suggests that the number of unreported cases would enable a better estimate of the effective reproduction rate (<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm124"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) and a good measure for pandemic control. Thus, we re-evaluated the reproduction numbers while highlighting the existence of unreported cases.</p>
              <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00463-f007">Figure 7</xref>a reports the number of new daily COVID-19 cases reported by Qatar’s authorities during the pandemic between March and July 2020. It shows our estimates of the <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm125"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for the state of Qatar. The early preventive measures, such as remote working and schooling, social distancing, and park and beach closure, taken by the state at the beginning of the spread of the virus led to an <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm126"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of 1.90. This estimate is lower than the reported <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm127"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> at the beginning of the pandemic. Starting from May, subsequent additional measures were taken by Qatar, such as an obligation to wear a mask, which resulted in an <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm128"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of approximately 1.25. Further reduction of <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm129"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> may have been achieved by the mandatory contact-tracing mobile application Ehteraz and limiting the number of passengers per vehicle, effective as of 4 June 2020. The interventions implemented beginning in May began to bear fruit, resulting in a peak of infection and an inflection point in early June, when the number of reported cases began to progressively decline. These measures enabled Qatar to start the safe reopening of business in July, and a progressive return to activity throughout the planned phases of reopening while keeping the <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm130"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> below one. We interpret that this could be achieved by maintaining a constant the level of intervention through mask-wearing and restricted access, in addition to imposing the use of the contact tracing app along with other measures, such massive testing combined with both targeted and random sampling.</p>
              <p>For the Qatari population, when investigating the dynamics of non-pharmaceutical intervention such as quarantine, social distancing, mask-wearing, and symptom monitoring (using Ehteraz App, Doha, Qatar), we find that the effectiveness of symptom monitoring, in addition to mask-wearing and quarantine, in controlling the disease is efficient for reducing the effective reproduction number by 81%, while social distancing and quarantine alone reduced the <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm131"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> by 21%, and mask-wearing with the former intervention accounted for 62% of the reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00463-f007">Figure 7</xref>b).</p>
              <p>For the post-COVID-19 recovery of economies, we propose investing in additional longer-term protection, such as the application of smart anti-viral and anti-bacterial coatings for surfaces that are touched often [<xref rid="B46-biology-10-00463" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This strategy would enable us to provide baseline protection against viral mutation, seasonal flu, and bacterial infections that would greatly help in avoiding overloading healthcare systems. This type of longer-term intervention might play a role in various situations, especially with respect to upcoming major sporting events that the country plans to host, such as the world cup in 2022.</p>

              <title>4. Conclusions</title>
              <p>We applied a modified SIR model with comprehensive consideration of the identification of model parameters using reported case data, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, to model the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic for some of the GCC countries and some representative countries in Europe and New York City, taking into consideration the rate of unreported cases and the importance of its estimation in affecting the actual spread of the virus and the level of measures taken to face it. Thus, we estimated the basic reproduction rates <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm132"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>and</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> The objective of the analysis was to identify the early phases of the epidemics, and to predict the next phase and the shape of their evolution, while incorporating unreported cases into the transmission dynamics. The model also aims to highlight the effectiveness of the implementation of major public policies restricting social movement result in a time-dependent exponentially decreasing number of cases to support a safe reopening strategies in the GCC countries. The model can be generalized for a wider range of countries.</p>
              <p>Our epidemiological model supports the evaluation of COVID-19 management activities in the early pandemic period, mainly when most of the population is susceptible and the public understanding of the symptoms is degrading. The value of this epidemiological model analysis is its ability to view various aspects, providing the impact of unreported cases. Furthermore, this model illustrates the results of preventive strategies more accurately without a prior knowledge of the consequence of disease incursions. However, there is a limitation in the analysis when using the data sourced from early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this study did not take into account the hosts who were immune to COVID-19 either through infection or inoculation, the modified SIR model with a varying number of susceptible hosts at a time can depict the influence in dynamic circumstances.</p>
