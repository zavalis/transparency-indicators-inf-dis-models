              <abstract>
                <p>West Nile virus is a widely spread arthropod-born virus, which has mosquitoes as vectors and birds as reservoirs. Humans, as dead-end hosts of the virus, may suffer West Nile Fever (WNF), which sometimes leads to death. In Europe, the first large-scale epidemic of WNF occurred in 1996 in Romania. Since then, human cases have increased in the continent, where the highest number of cases occurred in 2018. Using the location of WNF cases in 2017 and favorability models, we developed two risk models, one environmental and the other spatio-environmental, and tested their capacity to predict in 2018: 1) the location of WNF; 2) the intensity of the outbreaks (i.e. the number of confirmed human cases); and 3) the imminence of the cases (i.e. the Julian week in which the first case occurred). We found that climatic variables (the maximum temperature of the warmest month and the annual temperature range), human-related variables (rain-fed agriculture, the density of poultry and horses), and topo-hydrographic variables (the presence of rivers and altitude) were the best environmental predictors of WNF outbreaks in Europe. The spatio-environmental model was the most useful in predicting the location of WNF outbreaks, which suggests that a spatial structure, probably related to bird migration routes, has a role in the geographical pattern of WNF in Europe. Both the intensity of cases and their imminence were best predicted using the environmental model, suggesting that these features of the disease are linked to the environmental characteristics of the areas. We highlight the relevance of river basins in the propagation dynamics of the disease, as outbreaks started in the lower parts of the river basins, from where WNF spread towards the upper parts. Therefore, river basins should be considered as operational geographic units for the public health management of the disease.</p>

                <p>West Nile virus is a widely spread flavivirus, which is transmitted from birds to humans by mosquitoes. In humans, the virus can cause West Nile Fever (WNF) and in some cases, it affects the nervous system leading to severe symptoms that may result in death. Human cases have increased in Europe since the large-scale epidemic in 1996, being 2018 the year with the highest number of cases registered to date. We developed risk models based on 2017 cases, and predicted in 2018: 1) the occurrence of the disease; 2) the intensity of the outbreaks; and 3) the imminence of the cases. We identified favorable areas for the incidence of the virus in which environmental and human-related variables had an important role. The outbreaks began in the lower areas of large river basins and spread to higher areas, which highlights the importance of river basins in the propagation of outbreaks. Consequently, the early warning should be based on a basin scale.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging <italic>Flavivirus</italic> (family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>) [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] transmitted by different mosquito species of the genus <italic>Culex</italic> and <italic>Aedes</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle among birds, which are the WNV competent reservoirs [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Humans and equids are the dead-end hosts of the virus cycle [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. When infected by WNV, most humans remain asymptomatic, whereas 20% develop a zoonotic febrile illness [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] that is known as West Nile Fever (WNF). Less than 1% of infected individuals develop severe neurological symptoms, with a 0,1% mortality rate of those infected [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Today there is still no human vaccine or antiviral treatments for WNV, which makes identifying the environmental correlates of the disease more important for prevention [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>WNV is currently spreading in Europe [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. From its isolation in 1937 in the West Nile District of Uganda [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], it is thought to have spread throughout the globe via migratory birds [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is also supposed to have passed in this way from Africa to Europe, where it is circulating since the 1950s, with the first European outbreak in humans recorded in 1962 in the Camargue, southern France [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In 1996, Europe experienced its first major WNV infection epidemic, with 393 cases in Romania, including 17 deaths [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since then, new cases have been reported in eastern, western and southern Europe, with a typical seasonal nature from April to November [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The transmission season of 2018 was exceptional; 1,605 cases were confirmed, which is double the sum of cases registered in the previous three years [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although WNV has been detected widely in birds and horses through Europe [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the distribution of the disease in humans is restricted to the southern and southeastern Europe.</p>
              <p>Understanding the processes that drive the distribution patterns of living organisms in space and time is a main aim of biogeography, which, thus, may provide useful insights to medical geography [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The study of spatio-temporal patterns in the distribution of diseases has recently been termed as pathogeography [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Zoonotic outbreaks may be related to environmental and socio-economic factors that could affect dead-end host, vector and reservoir species [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Pathogeographic models allow the needed multi-level understanding of the temporal and spatial patterns of infectious diseases and, consequently, are useful for predicting the risk of WNF outbreaks [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Given that environmental data are continuous and no clear thresholds can be established to predict a zoonotic disease, fuzzy logic provides a suitable approach for modelling the relationships between disease outbreaks and environmental data [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In fact, fuzzy logic [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] has been already applied to the development of predictive models related to WNV at a biochemical level [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>Here we used fuzzy logic, through the application of favorability functions [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], to assess to what degree certain environmental conditions or particular geographical locations can favor the emergence of WNF, even in places where it has not yet been reported. The ultimate aim of this study was to produce a cartographic model of the risk of occurrence of WNF cases in Europe, which can be useful for the prevention of and early response to future outbreaks. Specifically, we analyzed the geographic variation of the cases recorded in 2017 to model the environmental and spatial factors that determine the future risk of the disease incidence, in terms of its occurrence and prevalence. Then we tested the capacity of the risk models to predict, both in space and time, the apparently unusual pattern of WNV disease cases during the 2018 transmission season.</p>

                <p>The study area consisted of the European continent except for Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova. The total area of study was divided into NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) level 3 [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which were used as operational geographic units (OGUs [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009022.g001">Fig 1</xref>). However, for Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland, the NUTS level 2 were used to increase homogeneity in the size of the OGUs. Similarly, the different NUTS that make up the London area (Outer London—East and North East; Outer London—West and North West; Outer London—South; Inner London—West and Inner London—East) were joined together as a single OGU: London. This resulted in a total of 931 OGUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009022.g001">Fig 1</xref><bold>)</bold>.</p>

                <p>We got epidemiological data from the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC, 2019) for 2017 and 2018. Only confirmed cases of WNF were used following at least one of the European criteria for confirmed cases [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]: a) isolation of WNV from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); b) detection of WNV nucleic acid in blood or CSF; c) WNV-specific antibody response (immunoglobulin M; IgM) in CSF; or d) WNV IgM high titer, detection of WNV IgG and confirmation by serum neutralization test. With this information, we obtained a binary variable defining the presence or absence of cases in each OGU in 2017 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009022.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We also obtained a binary variable for the presence or absence of cases in each OGU in 2018, and another variable with the number of cases in each OGU in 2018, to validate the risk-models predictions regarding outbreak location and intensity, respectively (see below). The temporal pattern of occurrence of WNF cases in 2018 was measured using the Julian week of the first case recorded in the OGUs, which was used to validate the temporal predictions of the risk models produced with information from 2017 (see below).</p>

These variables were selected because they were assumed to have a potential effect on life cycles and body conditions of mosquitoes, birds or humans, or to be at least correlated with more proximal causal factors. In addition, we used the geographical coordinates, latitude and longitude, of the geographical barycenter of each OGU to assess the spatial structure of the distribution pattern of occurrence of WNF cases [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. All these variables were used to build the predictive risk models based on the information recorded in 2017.</p>

                <title>Modelling procedure</title>
                <p>We used biogeographical modelling based on fuzzy logic to analyze, separately, the environmental envelope and the spatial structure of the disease in the study area. The disease environmental envelope model was produced following several steps. First, we assessed the individual explanatory power of every environmental variable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0009022.s001">S1 Table</xref>). This power was established according to the significance of score tests in univariate logistic regressions of the presence/absence of 2017 cases in each OGU on each environmental variable separately [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In order to control the noise effect of multicollinearity among the environmental variables, pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between all the variables. If two variables had a correlation higher than 0.8 and were included in the same subtype (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0009022.s001">S1 Table</xref>), the variable with less individual explanatory power was deleted from the subsequent steps.</p>
                <p>To limit the increase in type I error derived from the number of environmental variables considered, we controlled the False Discovery Rate (FDR) [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To do this, the remaining environmental variables were arranged in decreasing order according to their significance for explaining the distribution of disease cases. Only the variables whose significance in the score test was less than <italic>i</italic>×q/V (where <italic>i</italic> is the position of the variable in the order referred, <italic>q</italic> = 0.05 was the FDR, and <italic>V</italic> was the total number of remaining variables) were used in the following steps.</p>
                <p>A multivariate logistic regression model was then produced via a step-by-step introduction of the subset of variables that went over the previous filters. This stepwise process started with a null model with no explanatory variable, and then a variable was added at each step only if the resulting new regression was significantly improved compared to that produced in the previous step according to the omnibus test. Thus, the environmental variables included in the final environmental model were a parsimonious representation of all the effects imputable to the set of variables analyzed in the stepwise procedure. The values of the parameters of the logistic regression were established by maximum likelihood estimation using a machine learning algorithm. The weight of every variable in the model was assessed with the test of Wald.</p>
                <p>The result of the multivariate logistic regression was, in each OGU, a probability value (<italic>P</italic>) of presenting at least one human case of WNF based on the environmental conditions. <italic>P</italic> values were transformed into favorability (<italic>F</italic>) values using the Favorability Function [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]:

<italic>n1</italic> is the number of OGUs with reported cases, and <italic>n0</italic> the number of OGUs with no case reported. In this way, an environmental <italic>F</italic> value (ranging from 0 to 1) was calculated for each OGU, which represents the degree to which environmental conditions at that OGU favor the occurrence of WNF outbreaks.</p>
                <p>We also produced a spatio-environmental WNF model. Firstly, we analyzed the spatial structure of the disease in the study area in 2017, which may be attributed to contagious biological processes that affect the progression of the disease [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] such as, for example, the chronology of arrivals of the reservoir species or the dispersion of hosts and vectors. For that purpose, a purely spatial variable was constructed based on the coordinates latitude (<italic>La</italic>) and longitude (<italic>Lo</italic>). A polynomial trend-surface analysis [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] was conducted through a logistic regression of the presence/absence of cases in the OGUs on nine different combinations of latitude and longitude (i.e., <italic>La</italic>, <italic>Lo</italic>, <italic>La</italic><sup>2</sup>, <italic>Lo</italic><sup>2</sup>, <italic>La</italic> x <italic>Lo</italic>, <italic>La</italic><sup>3</sup>, <italic>Lo</italic><sup>3</sup>, <italic>La</italic><sup>2</sup> x <italic>Lo</italic>, <italic>La</italic> x <italic>Lo</italic><sup>2</sup>), in backward steps. This produced a probability value of presenting at least one WNF case for each OGU according to its spatial location. Analogously to the environmental model, we obtained the spatial favorability for the occurrence of cases in the study area.</p>
                <p>We used the resulting logit function of the spatial logistic regression as a new variable (<italic>Ysp</italic>), which was included together with the subset of variables selected in the multivariate environmental model to elaborate, through a new forward stepwise logistic regression, a spatio-environmental model, which took into account both the spatial structure and the environmental envelope of the WNF cases in 2017. All modelling processes were run with the IBM SPSS Statistics 25 software.</p>

                <title>Evaluation of the model descriptive capacity</title>
                <p>We evaluated the discrimination and classification capacity of the models as well as their calibration with the data of 2017. The discrimination power of the models was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The classification power, using the value of F = 0.5 as classification threshold, was estimated through the sensitivity, specificity, Cohen’s kappa and correct classification rate (CCR) [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and the over-prediction and under-prediction rates [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The calibration of the models was tested using the Hosmer and Lemeshow test [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which is frequently used in risk prediction models. This test assessed whether the frequency of observed OGUs with WNF cases matched the expected frequency in subgroups of the OGUs, where subgroups were identified as the deciles of fitted risk probability values. Models for which differences between expected and observed numbers in subgroups were not significant were considered to be well-calibrated.</p>

                  <title>Predicting the occurrence of cases</title>
                  <p>We tested whether the favorability for the presence of disease cases in each OGU in 2017 could be used to anticipate which OGUs were more likely to present cases of WNF during the following year. We hypothesized that the spatio-environmental model should be more useful than the purely environmental model for this aim since both the environmental and the spatial characteristics associated to the OGUs should be related with the expected location of cases. In any case, we tested the predictive classification and discrimination capacity of both the environmental and the spatio-environmental models, as well as their calibration, with information obtained in 2018. The discrimination power of the models was assessed using the AUC [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], whereas the classification power was estimated through the sensitivity, specificity, kappa, CCR, and the over-prediction and under-prediction rates, using the value of F = 0.5 as classification threshold [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Hosmer and Lemeshow’s test cannot be used to validate the calibration of the predictive models when the prevalence in the values to be predicted differ from that in the training dataset, as prevalence affects probability values [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The calibration of the predictions was assessed instead using Miller’s calibration line [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which assesses the bias and spread of predictions. Miller’s line has the intercept and slope of the logit of a logistic regression of observations on the logit of predicted probabilities. Therefore, this is of no use with the training data, as perfect calibration (i.e., intercept = 0 and slope = 1) is always attained on the same data that were used for building the model, but it is useful for validating a model when applied to predict other data, such as those of 2018 (Miller et al., 1991). Intercept values different from 0 indicate variation in overall prevalence, whereas slope values are indicative of the calibration of the trend in the predictions.</p>

                  <title>Predicting the intensity of cases</title>
                  <p>We hypothesized that, once WNV has reached a location, the environmental model should be a better predictor of the number of cases per OGU than the spatio-environmental model. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that it is the environmental potential of each region for the development of WNV infections that should favor the internal spread of the disease once the outbreak has started. Nevertheless, in those OGUs with WNF cases during 2018, we tested if there was a correlation between the number of cases in 2018 and both the environmental and the spatio-environmental favorability values, using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. A positive relationship between environmental favorability and abundance of species has already been demonstrated [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] but, to our knowledge, such a relationship has never been confirmed for the incidence of any zoonotic disease.</p>

                  <title>Predicting the imminence of cases</title>
                  <p>We tested the hypothesis that the spatio-environmental favorability of an OGU for the occurrence of the disease could anticipate how early disease cases would occur in the course of the following year. We hypothesised that the higher the spatial and environmental favorability, the earlier the cases would occur. We tested the correlation between the Julian week of the first case of the disease in 2018 and both the environmental and the spatio-environmental favorability (as derived from 2017 data) for the occurrence of disease cases, using Spearman’s correlation coefficient.</p>
                  <p>As the development of the disease occurs through a contagious process highly dependent on the location of the first case, we first grouped the OGUs according to countries to assess the correlation within each country. Furthermore, we also tested if the temporal spread of the disease could be more associated to ecological systems, such as river basins, than to countries, as basins are natural geographic units with well-defined orographic limits and are known to affect the distribution of water-dependent organisms, such as mosquitoes, and birds [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Given the magnitude of the hydrographic basin of the Danube, we tested this hypothesis comparing: on the one hand, the correlation between the environmental favorability and the Julian week of the first case in the OGUs comprised by the entire basin of the Danube, irrespective of the country they belong to; and, on the other hand, the same correlation separately for the OGUs belonging to each of the countries totally or partially overlapping with the Danube basin.</p>

Rain-fed agriculture, as well as poultry and horse livestock were the human activities that also contributed to explain the distribution of WNF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0009022.s002">S2 Table</xref>). The favorable areas in Europe for the presence of WNF cases, according to the environmental envelope, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009022.g002">Fig 2</xref>, with favorability values grouped in four ranges: low (0–0.2), intermediate-low (0.2–0.5), intermediate-high (0.5–0.8) and high (0.8–1). The highest values were located in OGUs that reported cases in 2017, such as the Danube Basin (involving Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Hungary), the Po Basin in the north of Italy, the Greek OGUs around the Aegean Sea, and the south of Turkey (compare Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009022.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009022.g002">2</xref>). However, other OGUs with no cases in 2017 also showed high or medium-high environmental favorability for the occurrence of WNF, e.g., Poland, the Netherland or the south of Spain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009022.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

Remarkably, the models, both environmental and spatio-environmental, had higher kappa, specificity and CCR values as well as lower over-prediction rates when evaluated with the occurrences of the following year (2018) than with the cases with which they were built (2017). The Miller calibration lines for 2018 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009022.g005">Fig 5</xref>) had slopes slightly lower than 1 and intercepts higher than 0. The intercept higher than 0 implies that the models could not predict the increase in overall probability of occurrence, i.e., the higher prevalence of the disease in 2018 was due to causes not included in the models. The slopes close to 1 indicate that the models succeeded in predicting the relative trend of the probability pattern, i. e., the probability gradient throughout the OGUs was well predicted by the models.</p>

                  <p>The number of human cases detected in Europe jumped from 197 in 2017 to 1,605 in 2018. The number of cases per OGU reported in 2018 was more correlated with the environmental favorability (Spearman correlation = 0.35; <italic>p</italic> = 1.2E-5) than with the spatio-environmental favorability (Spearman correlation = 0.26; <italic>p</italic> = 1.06E-3). This agrees with our hypothesis that, once WNV has reached an area, the spatial structure of the disease is of less importance than the environmental characteristics of the OGU for determining the intensity of infections. The OGUs with the highest number of cases tended to have values of environmental favorability higher than 0.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009022.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The OGUs with high environmental favorability (F&gt;0.8) enclosed 60% of the total number of cases reported in 2018, and an additional 25% of cases were in OGUs with intermediate-high environmental favorability (0.5&lt;F&lt;0.8).</p>

                  <p>Contrary to our expectations, the earliness of WNF cases during 2018 was more significantly correlated with the environmental favorability (Spearman correlation = -0.35; <italic>p</italic> = 1.4E-5) than with the spatio-environmental favorability (Spearman correlation = -0.26; <italic>p</italic> = 1.2E-3). Specifically, the Julian week in which the first case occurred was earlier in the OGUs that showed the highest environmental favorability values. This relationship between time of the first reported case and environmental favorability was higher when river basins, rather than countries, were considered as a context. The OGUs inside the Danube river basin showed the most significant negative correlation between the time of appearance of the first cases and the environmental favorability (Spearman correlation = -0.52; <italic>p</italic> = 2.23E-7). However, when the correlations were performed within each country inside this river basin (i.e. Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Austria and Bulgaria), the mean correlation value was much lower (-0.12), and only Romania and Serbia showed significant correlations between favorability and the first occurrence time, with correlation values of -0.54 (<italic>p</italic> = 9.60E-4) and -0.75 (<italic>p</italic> = 8.01E-4), respectively. This suggests that river basins, rather than countries, had the main role in the temporal spread of the disease. This notion is also supported by the fact that most cases within Italy occurred in the OGUs located within the Po river basin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009022.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Furthermore, the Julian week of the first case was correlated with the number of cases per OGU (Spearman r = -0.643, p = 5.802E-19).</p>
                  <p>A low altitude was significantly related with the environmental favorability for the occurrence of WNF cases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0009022.s002">S2 Table</xref>) and, thus, was related with the earliness of cases in the OGUs. However, the role of altitude could be also linked to the relevance of river basins as units of temporal spread, given that basins are typically delimited by mountains. The Julian week of the first cases in 2018 was, in fact, more significantly correlated with the average altitude of the OGUs (Spearman correlation = 0.39, <italic>p</italic> = 5.64E-7) than with the overall environmental favorability; i.e., the OGUs with a higher altitude tended particularly to present later cases along the propagation season than those located at lower elevations. This suggests that mountains could be barriers, or at least filters, for the spread of the disease. To clarify this complex interrelation, we showed the temporal spread of disease cases concerning environmental favorability and elevation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009022.g007">Fig 7</xref>.</p>

Although certain topographical and hydrographic characteristics of the OGUs, as well as some human activities related to agriculture and livestock practices, can favor the occurrence of outbreaks of WNF, climate was the most important factor, as it provided the two most significant predictors of the environmental risk (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0009022.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0009022.s002">S2</xref> Tables). Human density and infrastructures or types of ecosystems did not add significant explanatory power to the model. Precipitation was also non-explanatory, perhaps because potentially more influential features such as precipitation in spring and early summer were not available in the CHELSA database.</p>

                  <title>Human-related predictors</title>
                  <p>Rain-fed crops contributed significantly to favor the distribution of WNV infections. Other studies also showed that the incidence of WNF had a positive relationship with agriculture [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that this relationship could be due to differences in the mosquito communities inhabiting the urban and agricultural environments [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, host diversity could be also behind this association. The relationship between biodiversity and transmission of infectious diseases is known [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A high diversity of birds has been shown to have a negative effect on the prevalence of WNF, acting as a natural buffer to WNV amplification [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This is so because, as the local diversity of bird species increases, the abundance of non-competent hosts also increases, which entails a reduction in the rate of encounters between infected hosts and vectors. The intensification of agriculture is known to contribute to a reduction in biodiversity [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], agricultural areas being usually linked to a low diversity of birds [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Therefore, rain-fed agricultural areas could favor the distribution of WNF cases in Europe by decreasing the local diversity of birds, which prevents the dilution of disease transmission between vectors and competent hosts.</p>
                  <p>Poultry farms seem to favor the occurrence of WNF cases in the OGUs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0009022.s002">S2 Table</xref>). In the same way as other birds, hens and chickens (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) are susceptible to get infected by WNV [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, the presence of poultry farms may be a potential source of virus amplification. Poultry farms would facilitate the establishment of the virus brought by migrating birds. Consequently, a higher number of poultry farms would facilitate the bird-to-bird transmission by mosquitoes, thus amplifying the enzootic cycle, with farms acting as efficient reservoirs of the disease and facilitating transmission to people.</p>
                  <p>Horse density also appears to favor the outbreak of the disease. This may be caused by the fact that equestrian farms provide suitable environments and breeding sites for the proliferation of mosquitoes, water troughs, ponds and purines being the most favorable habitats for the development of mosquito larvae [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> is the principal vector of WNV in Europe [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and the most abundant mosquito species, by far, in equestrian farms [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In fact, in 2018 WNV was for the first time detected in Germany among horses from the Brandenburg and Sachsen-Anhalt region. The following year, WNV was first detected among humans in the country, in the region of Sachsen-Anhalt and in the contiguous regions of Leipzig and Berlin [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, horses may not only be dead-end hosts in the WNV cycle, but their farms may also act as a focus of proliferation of its main vector.</p>

                  <title>The role of temperature</title>
                  <p>The most significant environmental predictor of WNF was the increase in temperature annual range. This could be related to the diversity and abundance of migrant breeding bird species. A higher temperature range implies a higher seasonality in environmental energy and, thus, in the availability of food resources. This may be detrimental for resident bird species, as food availability is less stable, but, precisely because of that, might be favorable for migratory breeding species. A high-temperature range increases the number of summer migrants waterbird species in the European river basins by reducing the number of competing resident species [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, our results suggest that WNV-carrying migratory birds may be attracted by the periodic abundance of food and habitat that competing resident species could not fully utilize.</p>
                  <p>According to our results, the maximum temperature of the warmest month was the second most significant variable for explaining the distribution of cases of WNF in Europe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0009022.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0009022.s004">S4</xref> Tables). The weather has been previously proven to be related to the prevalence of WNF [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], especially high temperatures, which are one of the most important drivers for WNV transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. WNV circulation in northern Europe is probably limited by low temperatures [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Temperature has a significant effect on the virus and the vectors, as high values increase replication rates [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and make mosquitoes transmit the virus earlier by shortening the gonotrophic cycle and increasing the bite rate [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p>
                  <p>This is why climate warming may produce changes in the expansion of vectors, both at higher altitudes and at higher latitudes [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], favoring the establishment of WNV in new regions [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Climate warming is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods or droughts, thus intensifying the interactions between vectors, viruses and hosts [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Droughts, for example, increase the abundance of mosquitoes, ultimately favoring the risk of transmission of WNV to humans [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>

                <title>Spatial risk model</title>
                <p>The spatial model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009022.g003">Fig 3</xref>) is in accordance with other studies that reported a high prevalence of WNF within the Danube and Po basins [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The Danube basin constitutes an important settlement area for migratory birds from Europe, Asia and Africa, and consequently a concentration area for the pathogens carried by migrant birds during their routes along the stopover and feeding areas [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
                <p>For species breeding in Europe and wintering in Africa, there is a strong relationship between the longitudes of breeding and non-breeding sites [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Therefore, migratory birds that overwinter in East Africa mostly use the eastern migration route, either crossing the Danube Basin or breeding in it [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Passerines, in particular, basically follow two broad routes in their Afro-Palearctic migration: the western and the eastern one [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Given the formidable ecological barrier posed by the Sahara Desert, the eastern migration route is predominantly driven along the eastern edge, where the longitudinal extent of the hospitable area is reduced [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Therefore, the Nile River acts as a corridor connecting sub-Saharan Africa with the Palearctic for migratory birds. This may be the reason for the existence of a spatially favorable area for WNF in the Anatolian coast, facing the mouth of the Nile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009022.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Indeed, countries along the Nile Basin (i.e. Egypt, Sudan, South Sudan and Uganda) show a high prevalence of the disease [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p>

                <title>Prediction of cases: Occurrence, intensity and imminence</title>
                <p>The fuzzy concept of favorability allowed us to identify the effects of the intrinsic conditions of the OGUs on the distribution of WNF independently of the prevalence of the disease (i.e. of the absolute incidence of WNF cases) [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thanks to this, not only the risk for occurrence of the disease was predicted for the following year, but also the distribution of the number of cases per OGU that would occur in the next transmission season, as well as the imminence/timing of disease propagation.</p>
                <p>The unusually intense outbreak that happened in Europe in 2018 could be a symptom of a new phase of WNV expansion [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. It could be a consequence of the atypically hot summer of 2018 [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The variable temperature in the warmest month we used in our environmental model was an average of 35 years (1979–2013), which prevented the model from predicting the overall higher prevalence of the disease in 2018. However, the general trend was well predicted, as temperatures were uniformly higher in 2018 than in 2017, so local prevalence was higher, but the differential pattern among OGUSs was maintained.</p>
                <p>The predictive spatio-environmental model was more effective than the exclusively environmental model when classifying and discriminating the OGUs with cases of WNF, both in 2017 and in 2018. The spatio-environmental model considered the potential effects of biotic contagious processes on the distribution of outbreaks, such as the phenology and the routes of migration of the reservoir species, or the dispersion of hosts and vectors. Our results suggest that these processes may restrict the disease to southern and eastern Europe. Therefore, to update the risk map of WNF outbreaks in Europe it is important to efficiently update the spatial distribution of cases.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the environmental model highlights the potential of non-affected areas to develop disease cases if the spatial trend of the disease changes. For example, although WNF cases were not present in Spain in 2017, the environmental model detected favorable OGUs for the disease in southern Spain, where cases and deaths recently occurred [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Inside the affected areas, the environmental model was able to predict the number of cases recorded in the different OGUs. In other words, our environmental model can predict how intensely the cases will occur in the OGUs. This could be linked to the fact that environmental favorability values were also related to the imminence of disease cases in the following year. The greater the environmental favorability of a territory, the earlier the virus manifests, and the more time it has for developing and accumulating cases until the end of the season. This was corroborated by the significant correlation between the number of cases per OGU and the Julian week of the first case.</p>

                <title>The role of river basins</title>
                <p>Our results highlight the importance of river basins as biogeographic units in the disease propagation. An excellent example is the case of Italy, where all the 31 continental OGUs that presented cases in 2018 were completely within the Po river basin, independently of the political unit they belong to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009022.g004">Fig 4</xref>). River basins act as natural geographical units with ecological functions [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
                <p>Rivers, lakes and wetlands are linked through water movements within river basins [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and, thus, are normally affected by similar biogeographical and ecological factors within the same basin, which are diverse in different basins. Birds can pass over boundaries of river watersheds; however, their movements, apart from migrations, predominantly occurs inside the river basin [<xref rid="pntd.0009022.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. That is also true for mosquitoes, as water availability for their breeding is shared within a river basin. Therefore, if river basins affect vectors and reservoir of the virus, the virus could spread more easily within the same watershed.</p>
                <p>The highest parts of river basins are the most unfavorable ones for the presence of WNF, and they are the last to manifest cases. The first cases were reported in low regions, and these were followed by cases in medium-altitude areas, the most elevated OGUs being those that presented the least and latest cases within the river basin. Following this reasoning, the spread of the disease would begin in the lowest areas of the valleys, with the greatest water availability and the highest density of vectors and reservoirs. From there, it would spread gradually throughout the entire river basin occupying firstly the most favorable low-altitude areas and then to the highest and least favorable ones. Therefore, country-specific actions would be insufficient for managing the yearly dynamic of WNF spread, since it may be conditioned by environmental and ecological characteristics that affect all countries within a basin. Thus, decision-making would be more efficient from an ecosystem perspective, considering river basins as operational units, irrespective of political borders. This, together with the awareness of the human and environmental factors that favor the appearance and propagation of WNF outbreaks, may lead to taking early actions in the high-risk areas that could reduce the impact of the disease and the number of affected people.</p>

              <p>Title: Predicting the spatio-temporal spread of the West Nile virus in Europe</p>
              <p>The manuscript describes the development of risk models for spread of one of the most important emerging arboviral infections in Europe. The spatio-environmental model predicts the locations of WNF outbreaks best, and the environmental model predicts the intensity of the cases. The information gained in the manuscript is in-line with the previous knowledge. An English lecturer should read the introduction.</p>
              <p>Minor comments:</p>
              <p>The influence of precipitation in the spring and early summer month would also be interesting to consider. The considered variables in the development of the models are annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality. Are they enough to get a good picture of the influence of precipitation? In addition, the influence of rain-fed agriculture on WNFV indicates, that this could be important to look into.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript “Predicting the spatio-temporal spread of the West Nile virus in Europe ” is an original work aiming to provide insights on how environmental variables can be exploited to predict the spread of WNV in Europe. The topic is of interest. However, the length of the manuscript renders it quite difficult to focus and uncover the most important things. Additionally, several parts of the text are lengthy and irrelevant to the study – e.g. the first paragraph of the introduction, other phrases within that section, etc. The discussion is also rather extended (9 pages) and requires its re-reading several times in order to extract the important findings of this work. I suggest that the authors rearrange their manuscript by keeping only the important parts of it. </p>
              <p>Line 4. “West Nile virus” (and elsewhere in the manuscript). </p>
              <p>Line 5. The term “final hosts” applies for parasites, wherein a “final” host is required to complete the biological cycle. The proper term here is “dead-end” or “incidental”. </p>
              <p>Line 6. “Which affects the nervous system causing the West Nile Fever (WNF), leading to death”. a) The fact that the virus affects the nervous system (a condition called West Nile neuroinvasive disease, WNND) is not the same as fever. b) The way this has been written implies that WNV infection has always a lethal outcome. Please rephrase and use proper medical reports to present this sentence properly. This also applies for lines 31-32.</p>
              <p>Lines 6-8. “Since the circulation of the virus in Europe in the 1950s, human cases have just increased, with 2018 having the highest number of cases registered to date”. The expression “human cases have just increased” is misleading, as “just” should refer to the last 25 years. The first large-scale epidemics in humans occurred in Romania during 1996, with 393 encephalitis cases in humans, including 16 deaths. Lineage 2 was first isolated in 2004 and increased numbers of cases due to this lineage were observed from 2010 onwards. This also applies for lines 32-33. </p>
              <p>Lines 44-54. This paragraph is irrelevant to the present study. The introduction should briefly summarize the current situation as well as what is lacking from literature regarding the studied topic. </p>
              <p>Line 55. “Flavivirus” and “Flaviviridae” should be italicized to comply with ICTV nomenclature rules. </p>
              <p>Lines 60-61. Reference to non-existent vaccines and drugs is not associated with the study. </p>
              <p>Lines 55-64. I suggest to reorganize and simplify this paragraph, by mentioning firstly how the virus is being transmitted, secondly the hosts, and lastly the condition in infected humans. </p>
              <p>Lines 65-77. This paragraph is also lengthy. The authors should help the reader focus to the main targets of their work and introduction should be written in a way to assist to this process. The fact, for example, that WNV took its name by the West Nile district of Uganda is distracting, not to mention that it is widely known. </p>
              <p>Line 119. “WNV-specific IgM”, etc. Use “serum (or virus) neutralization test” instead of “neutralization”. </p>
              <p>Line 275. “Rain-fed agriculture, as well as poultry and horse livestock were the human activities that also contributed to explain the distribution of the WNF” How do the authors interpret the finding regarding horses? Other factors are directly associated with the vector or the propagation of the virus itself (birds). So, could there be an explanation or hypothesis for this finding?</p>
              <p>Line 517. “Horse density also appears to favor the outbreak of the disease. This may be caused by the fact that equids are also dead-end hosts of the virus cycle.” How can this be supported? In horses the virus acts as in humans (dead-end) and mosquitoes cannot get infected by an infected horse. So, the dead-end character of the infection of horses (and humans), which is an accidental thing, is not expected to favor the outbreaks.</p>

                <bold>Key Review Criteria Required for Acceptance?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>As you describe the new analyses required for acceptance, please consider the following:</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Methods</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated?</p>
              <p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p>
              <p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p>
              <p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The objectives of the study are clearly elaborated and developed based on several established hypotheses. To address them, a well-calculated design has been made with several appropriate approaches. Although the methodology presented is extensive, it makes this analysis easier to understand. The population used for the predictive analysis is clearly described, supported by solid databases, with a sufficient sample size so that, in short, it is appropriate for the hypothesis analyzed in this work.</p>
              <p>The statistical analysis used is correct to support the conclusions.</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Results</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p>
              <p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The analysis presented is adjusted to the stated objectives, the results are clearly and completely presented, and the figures (tables, images) are of sufficient quality for clarity.</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Conclusions</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p>
              <p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?</p>
              <p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The limitations of the analysis are clearly described throughout. The conclusions are supported by the data presented, with a subsequent discussion that, although extensive, is well developed, with a good relationship between results and available data on the incidence of WNV and its causes, so it is useful to advance in the prediction of future outbreaks, both of this virus and of other possible zoonotic ones. This work is, therefore, highly relevant for public health.</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>

                <bold>Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend “Minor Revision” or “Accept”. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Minor points:</p>
              <p>- Delete the article in front of WNV and WNF throughout the entire document. Example: on line 4 replace "The West Nile virus ...." with "West Nile virus ....", on lines 46-47 replace "When infected by the WNV ...." with "When infected by WNV .... ", line 48 replace" that is known as the West Nile fever (WNF) "with" that is known as West Nile fever (WNF) ", or on line 312 replace" the WNF cases ..." by "WNF cases ... "</p>
              <p>- line 8: better replace “in Europe” with “the continent” in order not to repeat “Europe” so many times.</p>
              <p>- Replace throughout the document "the Julian week" by "the July week"</p>
              <p>- line 33: “being 2018 the year with…”</p>
              <p>- lines 60-62: (The transmission season of 2018 was exceptional; 1,605 cases were confirmed, which is twice as high as the sum of cases recorded in the previous three years): better “The transmission season of 2018 was exceptional; 1,605 cases were confirmed, which is double the sum of cases registered in the previous three years”</p>
              <p>- line 72: “…are helpful for predicting the risk for WNF outbreaks” replace by “… are useful for predicting the risk of WNF outbreaks.”</p>
              <p>- line 154: (“…added at each step if and only if the resulting new regression was…”) delete “if and”</p>
              <p>- line 243: a comma is needed (“…the higher the spatial and environmental favorability, the earlier the cases would…”)</p>
              <p>- lines 270, 285: delete “Error! Reference source not found.”</p>

              <p>Data Requirements:</p>
              <p>Please note that, as a condition of publication, PLOS' data policy requires that you make available all data used to draw the conclusions outlined in your manuscript. Data must be deposited in an appropriate repository, included within the body of the manuscript, or uploaded as supporting information. This includes all numerical values that were used to generate graphs, histograms etc.. For an example see here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001908#s5">http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001908#s5</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>Reproducibility:</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, PLOS recommends that you deposit laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future.

              <p>Dear Mr. García-Carrasco,</p>
              <p>We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript 'Predicting the spatio-temporal spread of West Nile virus in Europe' has been provisionally accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
              <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. A member of our team will be in touch with a set of requests.</p>
              <p>Please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes, so a swift response is appreciated.</p>
              <p>IMPORTANT: The editorial review process is now complete. PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling, formatting or significant scientific errors from this point onwards. Requests for major changes, or any which affect the scientific understanding of your work, will cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript.</p>
              <p>Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us now if you or your institution is planning to press release the article. All press must be co-ordinated with PLOS.</p>
              <p>Thank you again for supporting Open Access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
