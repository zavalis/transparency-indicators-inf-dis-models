                <p id="P4">The five boroughs of New York City (NYC) were early epicenters of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States, with over 380,000 cases by May 31. High caseloads were also seen in nearby counties in New Jersey (NJ), Connecticut (CT) and New York (NY). The pandemic started in the area in March with an exponential rise in the number of daily cases, peaked in early April, briefly declined, and then, showed clear signs of a second peak in several counties. We will show that despite control measures such as lockdown and restriction of movement during the exponential rise in daily cases, there was a significant net migration of households from NYC boroughs to the neighboring counties in NJ, CT and NY State. We propose that the second peak in daily cases in these counties around NYC was due, in part, to the movement of people from NYC boroughs to these counties. We estimate the movement of people using “Change of Address” (CoA) data from the US Postal Service, provided under the “Freedom of Information Act” of 1967. To identify the timing of the second peak and the number of cases in it, we use a previously proposed SIR model, which accurately describes the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic in European countries. Subtracting the model fits from the data identified, we establish the timing and the number of cases, N<sub>CS</sub>, in the second peak. We then related the number of cases in the second peak to the county population density, P, and the excess Change of Address, E<sub>CoA,</sub> into each county using the simple model <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>N</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CS</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mtext>P</mml:mtext><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CoA</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> which fits the data very well with α = 0.68, β = 0.31 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.74, p = 1.3e-8). We also find that the time between the first and second peaks was proportional to the distance of the county seat from NY Penn Station, suggesting that this migration of households and disease was a directed flow and not a diffusion process. Our analysis provides a simple method to use change of address data to track the spread of an infectious agent, such as SARS-Cov-2, due to migrations away from epicenters during the initial stages of a pandemic.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION:</title>
              <p id="P5">Coronaviruses are large, enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses. Although widespread in animals, they usually cause mild respiratory illnesses in humans [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In 2003, a new coronavirus emerged, which was named SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome – Corona Virus) and which caused a life-threatening respiratory disease in humans, with a fatality rate of almost 10% [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Unfortunately, because its impact was felt only in a few countries and was quickly brought under control, the initial burst of interest in the development of treatment options and vaccines quickly waned. In late 2019 a second coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, appeared in Wuhan, China, and has since caused a worldwide pandemic [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to cause pathology in humans [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The associated respiratory illness, called COVID-19, ranges in severity from a symptomless infection [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], to common-cold like symptoms, to viral pneumonia, organ failure, neurological complications and death [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. While the mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infections is significantly lower than in SARS-CoV [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], it has more favorable transmission characteristics, a higher reproduction number [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and a long incubation period of 4–6 days when the patient may be asymptomatic but infective [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P6">A large amount of consistent worldwide public data at varying granularity is available for the number of tests performed, confirmed cases, and deaths in different contexts, such as locations, comorbidities and complications [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These data provide important sources of information for the development and testing of models that can identify pandemic characteristics affecting viral dynamics, which can help guide policy by predicting the impact of various interventions [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is well known that the count of confirmed cases seriously underestimates the actual number of infections [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This is because not everyone who is infected is symptomatic, tested and identified, and not everyone who dies from the disease is identified [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Even the number of reported deaths may be underestimated because of co-mortalities; i.e. COVID-19 increases susceptibility to other diseases and conditions [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Moreover, the virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic individuals – who comprise a substantial portion of the infected population [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] – militating against accurate estimates of transmission probabilities. Nonetheless, models can provide useful information [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P7">The World Health Organization has identified contact tracing of infected individuals, followed by quarantining their contacts, as a key method to limit the spread of Covid-19 [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In places such as Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and China, where it has been effectively implemented, it has had an impressive impact [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, for a variety of reasons, contact tracing was not implemented effectively everywhere [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the United States, although strongly advocated by the CDC [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], contract tracing has been limited [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P8">In this paper, we focus on a novel method of contact tracing which is available in the US to monitor Covid-19 infections, namely “Change of Addresses” or CoA data, which can be obtained from the United States Postal Service (USPS) under the 1967 “Freedom of Information Act”. We focus on CoA between New York City (NYC) boroughs of the Bronx, New York (Manhattan), Kings (Brooklyn), Queens and Richmond (Staten Island) and the surrounding counties in the tri-state area of New Jersey (NJ), Connecticut (CT) and New York (NY) State. Our working hypothesis is that the excess movement of households from NYC boroughs to these surrounding counties from March-June 2020 contributed to a second wave of Covid-19 infections in these counties, particularly in counties with large excess CoA and high population densities.</p>
              <p id="P9">The first case of Covid-19 in the United States was confirmed on January 21, 2020 and the virus quickly spread to the tri-state area [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The first confirmed cases were registered in NY on March 1, in NJ on March 4 and in CT on March 8. Each of the tri-states responded by declaring a state of emergency (NY and NJ on March 7 and CT on March 10) and issuing a joint mandate that banned crowds of over 50 people, closed casinos, movie theatres and gyms, limited access to bars and restaurants to takeout service and set a night curfew. This was followed by each state ending in-person schooling, closing all non-essential businesses and issuing a “stay-at-home” order in an attempt at full-scale quarantine. All three states stayed in these lockdown conditions until a phased reopening began with Phase 1 (NY on June 8, NJ on June 10, CT on May 20) followed by several additional phases extending through June and July 2020 [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P10">In spite of these mandates, we will show that from March 2020 onwards, there was a significant movement of households between NYC boroughs and the surrounding counties in NJ, CT and NY in the tri-state metropolitan area (map in <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). We find that that the county population densities and the CoA excess from NYC boroughs to these counties correlates strongly with the number of cases in the second peak in the counties. Finally, the timing between the first and second peak in cases in the counties was proportional to the distance of the county seat from Penn Station, NY by car, suggesting that the movement of disease was a directed process, related to the movement of households from NYC to these counties, and not diffusion.</p>

The effect of infective Covid-19 individuals moving into a county would be higher in counties with high population densities and high CoA into the county. The six NJ counties with the highest population densities are Hudson (14,557 people per square mile), Essex (5,409 people per square mile), Union (4,001 people per square mile), Bergen (4001 people per square mile), Passaic (2,718 people per square mile) and Middlesex (NJ) (2671 people per square mile); the three CT counties with the highest population densities are Fairfield (1,510 people per square mile), New Haven (1,414 people per square mile) and Hartford (1,213 people per square mile); and the six nearby counties in NY State with the highest population density are Nassau (8157 people per square mile), Westchester (2247 people per square mile), Rockland (1877 people per square mile), Suffolk (1619 people per square mile), Orange (474 people per square mile) and Putnam (426 people per square mile). <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>–<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">o</xref> show the results for CoA from NYC boroughs to each of these counties.

                <title>Analysis of Covid-19 Daily Cases in NY, NJ, and CT.</title>
                <p id="P22">Seven-day averaged plots of daily Covid-19 cases in NYC, NJ, CT and NY State as a function of time show an initial first peak in daily cases around April 1, 2020, superimposed on secondary shoulders or peaks from mid-April to June (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 6</xref>,<xref rid="SD9" ref-type="supplementary-material">8</xref>,<xref rid="SD11" ref-type="supplementary-material">10</xref>). The first peak reflects the time dynamics of an initial exponential rise in infections in mid-March 2020 followed by a reduction in cases from quarantine and lockdown measures. However, the cause of the second peak has not yet been adequately explained. We propose that these second peaks were, in part, caused by the movement of households out of NYC to these counties, as identified by the CoA data described above.</p>
                <p id="P23">To support our hypothesis, we will show that the number of cases in the second peak, N<sub>CS</sub>, is related to (a) the county population density, P, and (b) the excess CoA, E<sub>CoA</sub>, from NYC into these NJ/CT/NY counties by the relationship <inline-formula><mml:math id="M3" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>N</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CS</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mtext>P</mml:mtext><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CoA</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. To demonstrate this relationship, we must identify the cases in the second peak in each county, which requires subtracting the cases in the first peak. To do this, we use a previously proposed SIR model (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix A</xref>) which was successfully applied to analyze the lockdown/quarantine phase of the Covid-19 daily case load and mortality in eight European countries and the United Kingdom [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The model parameters are obtained by fitting the model to the data for the ascending limb (small time exponential increase) and the first peak in daily cases. Using these two as input, the pandemic parameter, R, is estimated by fitting the model to the entire first peak (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix A</xref> for details of this model).</p>
                <p id="P24">The model described in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix A</xref> was applied to confirmed, seven-day averaged daily Covid-19 case data for each NYC borough and each NJ, CT and NY county (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 6</xref>, <xref rid="SD9" ref-type="supplementary-material">8</xref>, <xref rid="SD11" ref-type="supplementary-material">10</xref>).

                <p id="P25">The results for the location in time, amplitude and number of cases in the second peak, along with the CoA excess for each NJ/CT/NY county are given in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>. If migration of households was responsible for the second peak, the cases in the second peak would be due to an interaction between infective people that moved to the county from NYC and uninfected residents in the county, with higher peaks expected in more densely populated counties. We propose the simplest model for this relationship: <inline-formula><mml:math id="M4" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>N</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CS</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mtext>P</mml:mtext><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CoA</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> where N<sub>CS</sub> is the number of cases in the second peak in a given county, P is the county population density and <inline-formula><mml:math id="M5" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CoA</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the excess CoA into the county from NYC (Columns L, F and O in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>). Taking the log on both sides allows a bivariate linear regression analysis to fit the model to the data. We find an excellent fit of the data to this model (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>) with α = 0.68 and β = 0.31, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.74, F = 38.4, p-value = 1.3e-8, Spearman Rank Correlation = 0.88, p-value = 3.9e-7. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref> show the projection of the fitted data points (crosses) onto the P and E<sub>CoA</sub> coordinates respectively.</p>
                <p id="P26">Finally, we find that the number of days from the first peak to the second peak is proportional to the distance of the respective county seat from NY Penn Station by car (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.37, Pearson Correlation = 0.61, p-value = 1.2e-04). Since the relationship is approximately linear, this suggests a directed movement and not a diffusion process. This observation lends credence to our hypothesis that the CoA excess likely caused the second peak. Although it is somewhat of a speculation, the intercept of ~15 days on the y-axis in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref> may be because of the 14-day quarantine imposed on people moving to new locations in the early days of the pandemic.</p>
                <p id="P27">Finally, as one might expect, the excess CoA is roughly proportional to the county population density (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6e</xref>), so that these two variables are not independent. This makes sense because if the county population density P is low, there are very few cases in the second peak (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>). And likewise, for sufficiently low excess CoA, there are again only a few cases in the second peak (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION:</title>
              <p id="P28">Using household “Change of Address” data (CoA) from the United States Postal Service we have shown that there was a significant exodus of people from NYC boroughs to the surrounding counties in NJ, CT and NY, starting from the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020 and extending through the lifting of regulations in May-June 2020 and beyond (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>–<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 2</xref>–<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">5</xref>). The majority of household moves to these counties were from New York City (Manhattan) (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 2</xref>,<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>,<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">4</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P29">Our hypothesis is that this exodus of households into the counties surrounding NYC was partly responsible for second peaks in daily Covid-19 cases in these counties in May 2020. To test this hypothesis, we needed to identify the second peak in daily cases, both in time and amplitude. This is confounded by the presence of the first peak in daily cases during the initial phase of the pandemic in March-April 2020. Although the second peak in cases in each county is clearly visible in most counties (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 6</xref>,<xref rid="SD9" ref-type="supplementary-material">8</xref>,<xref rid="SD11" ref-type="supplementary-material">10</xref>), we must use a model to subtract the cases in the first peak to estimate the number of cases in the second peak. To do this, we used a previously proposed SIR model (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix A</xref>), which accurately captured the initial pandemic dynamic (solid red lines in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 6</xref>, <xref rid="SD9" ref-type="supplementary-material">8</xref>, <xref rid="SD11" ref-type="supplementary-material">10</xref>), from the early exponential rise in daily cases in March 2020 to the peak in early/mid-April 2020 and subsequent decrease in late April 2020, when the effects of quarantine and lockdown materialized. Although we could have fit the daily case data to some standard functional forms (Gaussian, Poisson, Negative Binomial, Beta function etc.), there is little justification for any of them, whereas our model not only captures the expected dynamics of the first peak but also fits the data very well. Subtracting the model fit to the first peak in daily cases clearly identified the daily cases in the second peak in each county (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 7</xref>, <xref rid="SD10" ref-type="supplementary-material">9</xref>, <xref rid="SD12" ref-type="supplementary-material">11</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P30"><xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref> summarizes our findings. We analyzed the data in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref> under the expectation that the number of cases, N<sub>CS</sub>, in the second Covid-19 peak should be related to the county population density P and the Excess CoA, E<sub>CoA</sub>, into the county from NYC. A bi-variate regression analysis showed that these were related by: <inline-formula><mml:math id="M6" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>N</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CS</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mtext>P</mml:mtext><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CoA</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> with α = 0.68 and β = 0.31, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.74, F = 38.4, p-value = 1.3e-8, Spearman Rank Correlation = 0.88, p-value = 3.9e-7 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig6a</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). A possible interpretation of the exponents in the fit would be that from March-June 2020, the proportion of individuals in each county was ~ P<sup>0.68</sup> and the number of infected/infective individuals that moved into each county was ~ (E<sub>CoA</sub>)<sup>0.31</sup>. We have also tried other types of fits to the data, which turn out not to be as good as the one we report. For example, both the number of cases in the second peak and the CoA could be normalized by either the population or the population density in the county and then one could try a fit of the form: <inline-formula><mml:math id="M7" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>N</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CS</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>P</mml:mtext></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CoA</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>P</mml:mtext></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> which becomes a linear relationship on taking logs. However, this fit has an R<sup>2</sup>~ 0.3. Curiously though, the value of the exponent <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> is still 0.31.</p>
              <p id="P31">We also found that the number of days from the first to the second peak is linearly related to the distance by road of the county seat from Penn Station (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>). This again suggests that there was a non-random (directed) migration of households out of NYC that may have spread Covid-19 to surrounding counties. Although we have no proof, we conjecture that the intercept of 15 days on the y axis in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref> may be due to the required quarantine period imposed after moving between locations during the initial phase of the pandemic.</p>
              <p id="P32">We now list some caveats and limitations of our study, some of which can be mitigated by additional data and future research.</p>
              <p id="P33">First, the USPS CoA data we analyzed did not include data for months when the moves out of or into the county totaled less than 10 per month. We do not expect this to affect our results by much, as the Excess CoA ranges over three orders of magnitude (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>) and the average excess CoA from the 15 counties with the highest population density was 298 changes per month from March–June 2020. A more serious limitation is the fact that the data only reports movements of “households” and does not specify the number of people that moved per household, and the latter will vary from county to county. It may be possible to correct this using data on average household sizes in each county and cell phone use data, especially with voice tagging.</p>
              <p id="P34">A large number of people commute into NYC each day from counties close by [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In particular, there is a lot of commuter traffic into NYC from Westchester, Nassau, Suffolk Counties in NY, Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Hudson Counties in NJ and Fairfield County in CT (Columns P and Q in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>). It is possible that when households relocated out of NYC into these counties, some individuals in these households continued to commute into the city daily possibly because of their status as essential workers. Such individuals would increase the risk of Covid-19 infections into the counties. It should be possible to include this correction into our model by studying commuter traffic data between NYC and the surrounding counties in the period March-June 2020. Unfortunately, this data is not yet available [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P35">An important limitation of our study is that we do not have data on whether an individual who moved was infected or healthy. To our knowledge, accurate data detailing movement of infected individuals does not exist, although confirmed hospital admissions of Covid-19 cases and tracking of their prior movements may provide a method to generate such data. We note however, that the virus spread more pervasively in NYC residents compared to those in surrounding counties, because there was a higher number of daily cases during the first peak in NYC boroughs compared the surrounding counties (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4a</xref>–<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">m</xref> compared to <xref rid="SD11" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 10a</xref>–<xref rid="SD11" ref-type="supplementary-material">e</xref>). This means that households moving out of NYC were more likely to contain infected individuals than households moving in the other direction. An interesting way to extend our study to simulate these effects would be to use the CoA data to seed infected individuals moving into various counties and use fits to the actual location and height of the second peaks to find the fractions of these infected individuals, using the number of cases in the first peak to estimate the initial values for these fractions.</p>
              <p id="P36">We determined the starting point of the second peak as the time when the daily cases in the second peak was near zero and the end point as the time when the case load tapered off to a constant value. Although this is somewhat arbitrary, we have checked that changing these start and end points by a few days is a 5–10% effect and does not change our conclusions.</p>
