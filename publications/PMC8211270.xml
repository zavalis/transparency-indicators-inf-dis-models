              <abstract>
                <p>Understanding the spread of infectious diseases is an extremely essential step to preventing them. Thus, correct modeling and simulation approaches are critical for elucidating the transmission of infectious diseases and improving the control of epidemics. The primary objective of this study is to simulate the spread of communicable diseases in an urban rail transit station. Data were collected by a field investigation in the city of Ningbo, China. A SEIR-based model was developed to simulate the spread of infectious diseases in Tianyi station, considering four groups of passengers (susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered) and a 14-day incubation period. Based on the historical data of infectious diseases, the parameters of the SEIR infectious disease model were clarified, and a sensitivity analysis of the parameters was also performed. The results showed that the contact rate (CR), infectivity (I), and average illness duration (AID) were positively correlated with the number of infections. It was also found that the length of the average incubation time (AIT) was positively correlated with the number of exposed individuals and negatively correlated with the number of infectors. These simulation results provide support for the validity and reliability of using the SEIR model in studies of the spread of epidemics and facilitate the development of effective measures to prevent and control an epidemic.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Infectious diseases are a type of disease caused by various pathogens that can be directly or indirectly transmitted from person to another, one animal to another or between people and animals. Epidemics of infectious diseases are occurring more often and spreading faster and further than ever in many different regions of the world [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Generally, infectious diseases are constantly evolving, emerging, and re-emerging, and an infection that is considered a national or global threat one year could be eliminated the next [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Initially, new infectious diseases could spread only as fast and far as the hosts could travel under their own power; however, in the context of globalization, the growth of trade activity, tourism and human migration is leading to increasingly widespread and rapid movement of disease vectors and, consequently, of the diseases they carry [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Subway stations [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which constitute one of the busiest sites worldwide, involve passenger connections and transfers. Due to the high concentration of passengers in subway stations, the transmission of a virus is more widespread than in other public places [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which poses potential threats to the health and safety of the passengers. On the one hand, with the development of urban rail transit networks, passenger flow continues to increase. For example, in 2019, a total of 40 cities in mainland China opened 6,720.27 kilometers of urban rail transit operating lines, with a total of 968.77 kilometers of new operating lines. The total passenger traffic volume reached 21.07 billion in 2018 [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], a year-on-year increase of 14%, with a total of 13.32 billion passenger trips and a total passenger turnover of 176.08 billion passenger-km (pkm). On the other hand, infectious diseases [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have plagued humans throughout history and have even shaped history on some occasions. The plagues of biblical times, the Black Death of the Middle Ages, and the “Spanish flu” pandemic of 1918 are a few examples [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, it is very important to study the spread of infectious diseases in public places, especially in subway stations, and to determine effective prevention and control measures for infectious diseases in public places.</p>

              <title>Literature review</title>
              <p>The spread of infectious diseases has seriously affected public health and has posed severe challenges to the global public health system. An epidemic of an infectious disease must have three basic elements, namely, an infectious agent, transmission routes and susceptibility. The standard public health emergency measures are usually the most efficient, including isolating the sources of infection, cutting off or interrupting transmission routes, and providing special care for the most susceptible people. For example, since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic started in Wuhan in late December 2019 [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the Chinese government has taken robust measures to curb the spread of the deadly virus, most notably ordering the full quarantine of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and implementing strong control and preventive measures in metropolitan areas such as Beijing and Shanghai as well as other population centers around China.</p>
              <p>At present, infectious disease prevention and control strategies mainly include [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]: (a) immunization; (b) the development of effective treatments and vaccines and other medical prevention and control measures; (c) isolation measures; (d) routine and practical epidemic prevention measures (such as temperature detection, the use of protective masks, ventilation, daily disinfection and epidemic prevention education, etc.); (e) school suspensions; (f) traffic control (blocking traffic, prohibiting traffic) and other nonmedical prevention and control measures. The above measures have played positive roles in preventing the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
              <sec id="sec003">
                <title>The transmission of a virus by transport</title>
                <p>Taking the COVID-19 epidemic as an example, there are three main transmission routes [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], direct transmission, aerosol transmission, and contact transmission. When a host infected with the virus coughs or sneezes, the virus sprays into the air along with saliva, mucus or other body fluids. When the liquid is deposited onto a healthy potential host or the healthy individual touches the surface of an object contaminated by these droplets, that individual may become infected. The virus responsible for COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can also spread through the air in the form of aerosols, but aerosol transmission is not the main route for this virus [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is generally believed that interpersonal interactions while using public transport in large cities may contribute to the spread of influenza because public transport, such as subways or airplanes, involves relatively enclosed spaces and dense traffic flow [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Previous studies have investigated the transmission routes of epidemic viruses, which are briefly reviewed in this section.</p>
                <p>About subway travel, Cooley et al. [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] conducted a simulation study to develop a unique influenza agent-based transmission model for New York City that explicitly represents subway riders as a transmission conduit, and they found that only 4% of transmissions occurred on the subway. The findings suggested that interventions targeted at subway riders would be relatively ineffective at containing the epidemic.</p>
                <p>Regarding school, Lee et al. [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] conducted another simulation study to explore the effects of various school closure strategies on mitigating influenza epidemics with different reproductive rates (R0). The results indicated that any type of school closure may need to be maintained throughout most of the epidemic (i.e., at least 8 weeks).</p>
                <p>Air travel, which involves more than three billion passengers annually, serves as a conduit for the spread of infectious diseases, including emerging infections and pandemics. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used by Boulbene, et a. (2012) [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to simulate the movement of air on a plane, and he found that when a passenger sneezes on the plane, the air flow actually helps spread the pathogen to other passengers. In a subsequent study, Weiss H. et al. (2019) [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] collected 229 environmental samples on ten transcontinental US flights and performed 16S rRNA sequencing. They found that although the microbiomes in airplane cabins had large flight-to-flight variations, they resembled the microbiomes of many other built environments.</p>
                <p>Therefore, based on the above previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], if using public transit is unavoidable during an epidemic, moving around the vehicle should be avoided to minimize the possibility of infection.</p>

              <sec id="sec004">
                <title>Modeling of infectious disease dynamics</title>
                <p>The spread of infectious diseases can be unpredictable; fortunately, modeling techniques can help compensate for imperfect information gathered from large populations under difficult prevailing circumstances [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The infectious disease dynamics (IDD) approach, a mathematical technique, has developed into a rich interdisciplinary field. It is driven both by the desire for fundamental understanding and the need to use that understanding to aid public health decision making.</p>
                <p>Compared with traditional statistical models, the IDD model can not only describe the process of disease development and transmission and predict the state of disease occurrence but also evaluate the effects of various prevention and control measures and provide decision-making support regarding the measures need to prevent and control diseases. At present, IDD models mainly include four types: compartment models (CMs), meta-population models (MMs), individual-based models (IMs), and network models (NMs).</p>
                <p>The main idea underlying the CM model is to divide the population into several compartments, which, respectively represent agents in different disease states, and then dynamic equations of related variables are established by mathematical techniques. Finally, the dynamic process of disease transmission can be modeled. For example, Kermack and McKendrick (1991) [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] predicted the number and distribution of cases of an infectious disease as it was transmitted through a population over time and proposed the classic SR model. The SR model is a compartmental differential-equation model that structures the infected population in terms of the age of infection while using simple compartments for people who are susceptible (S) and recovered/removed (R). Unfortunately, the generalizability of this model is difficult to analyze, and a number of open questions remain regarding its dynamics.</p>
                <p>In a subsequent study, the metapopulation model (MM) was proposed based on the classic IR model. The modeling concept underlying the metapopulation model is to simulate the migration behavior of individuals between populations, and an SIR model or SIS model can be used to simulate the infectious disease transmission process within the population. For example, Watts D. et al. (2005) [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] modeled the movement of individuals between contexts via simple transport parameters and allowed diseases to spread stochastically using MMs. They found that when epidemics occur, the basic reproduction number <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>0 may bear little relation to their final size. Next, Colizza V. et al. (2007) [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] constructed a theoretical and computational microscopic framework for the study of a wide range of realistic MMs and agent-based models that include the complex features of real-world networks. The results provided a general theoretical understanding of the behavior of more realistic MMs.</p>
                <p>The individual-based model (IM) is a microsimulation model that mainly includes a cellular automata model and an agent-based model. The modeling concept underlying the IM model is that individuals are treated as cells or agents with a limited set of state and behavior rules. By defining various rules of behavior, such as individuals’ responses to the etiology of the disease, individuals’ movement in space, and interactions among individuals, the final evolutionary behavior of a complex infectious disease system composed of the etiology, host and environment is eventually simulated. For instance, Milne G. et al. (2008) [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] simulated the transmission of and effectiveness of interventions for epidemic influenza in a community with an IM. The results indicated that multiple social distancing measures applied early and continuously could be effective at interrupting the transmission of the pandemic virus for R0 values up to 2.5.</p>
                <p>Moreover, for the network model (NM), the main underlying modeling concept is to treat individuals in the population as nodes in a network, and the contact relationships between individuals are described by the edges between nodes in the network. For instance, Ajelli M. et al. (2010) [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] conducted a side-by-side comparison of the results obtained with a stochastic agent-based model and a structured, stochastic MM for the progression of a baseline pandemic event in Italy. The results indicated that both models yielded epidemic patterns that were in very good agreement at the level of granularity accessible by both approaches. Riley [<xref rid="pone.0253220.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reviewed the application of four methods (patch model, distance-transmission model, multigroup model, and NM) to four diseases (measles, foot-and-mouth disease, pandemic influenza, and smallpox). The results showed that household demographics have an important impact on the spatial transmission of human diseases, such as smallpox, influenza, and other infectious diseases.</p>

              <title>Simulation method</title>
              <p>Given the characteristics of the spread of infectious diseases based on passenger flow through a rail transit station, passengers in a rail transit station and the SEIR model were chosen as the research subjects and the modeling method, respectively, for this study. Through the simulation of the spread of an infectious disease through the Tianyi station at Ningbo Rail Transit Line 1, the factors affecting the spread of the infectious disease, that is, the contact rate, the transmission ability, and the duration of the infectious disease, were quantitatively analyzed. In the context of rail transit, the speed of the spread of the disease and the infection rate can be affected by multiple factors. The most immediate factors include the number of infectious persons and their distribution among the passengers, the transmission route and the transmissibility of the infectious disease, and the level of immunity. Based on the five routes of transmission, namely, contact transmission, aerosol transmission, water and food transmission, insect transmission and others, this manuscript dissects the external and internal factors and the passenger-related factors that affect the spread of infectious diseases through rail transit systems. The external factors include the above transmission routes, while the internal factors include the temperature, humidity, facility layout, subway stations, air, hygienic conditions, density, and intensity of passengers in rail transit stations. The passenger-related factors include their basic characteristics, physical quality, behavioral habits, immunity, and medical history.</p>

                <title>The SEIR model</title>
                <p>The SIS or SIR model is generally used in studies of the spread of infectious diseases. Based on the SI model, the SIS model can be used to simulate infectious diseases such as common influenza by adding the measurable characteristics of the disease, and considering whether individuals are susceptible or infected. To simulate the production of antibodies after recover and thus the acquisition of immunity to the disease, the SIR model was developed by introducing a third status, recovered. Patients do not exhibit symptoms for a certain period as they move from the susceptible status to the infected status, during which time they do not spread the disease. To simulate the status of exposed but asymptomatic, the status exposed was introduced, and the SEIR model was developed. The SEIR differs from the SIR models in that it adds the duration of the disease and is more suitable for infectious diseases with no infectious potential during the incubation period.</p>

                    <list-item>
                      <p>Passengers choose the shortest routes to purchase tickets and enter and exit the station; all passengers are familiar with the process of entering and exiting the station and can handle basic business transactions independently.</p>

                    <list-item>
                      <p>The number of passengers who meet any given passenger is basically the same, which is expressed by the average contact rate.</p>

                  <p>The distributions of age, gender, health status and daily behavior of passengers in the rail transit station were investigated through a questionnaire survey. These data were combined with previous findings regarding relevant pedestrian behavior characteristics. The incubation period (exposure period) of the infectious disease was assumed to be 1–14 days, the recovered period was 30–60 days, and the transmissibility was 0.01–0.31.</p>
                  <p>The disease spreads through the contact message "infection". Thus, each passenger has four potential statuses: susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered. Passengers are initially susceptible. If they are exposed to the pathogen, they will enter the exposed status, which means that they display symptoms and produce antibodies against the pathogen. After a certain period, they will become susceptible again.</p>

Since There are 4 entrances and exits at Tingyi Station, and 4 entrances and exits are open under normal circumstances. During the survey time, we took 15 minutes as a time interval to count the flow of pedestrians entering the station during working days and non-working days respectively, and finally summarized them in units of 1 hour. Hence, for the convenience of simulation statistics, the number of simulated people per unit hour was set to 1000.</p>

                <p>After the construction of the infectious disease model, the simulation experiments were carried out and repeated several times to obtain different datasets.

The influence of other factors on the spread of the infectious disease due to the contact probability, transmissibility and duration of the infectious disease based on the experimental results was analyzed quantitatively by the control variable method of adjusting the values of the model parameters.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusion and future study</title>
              <p>In this study, the Tianyi rail transit station of Ningbo Rail Transit Line 1 was chosen as an example and used to construct an SIR model of the spread of an infectious respiratory disease in rail transit stations. Then, simulation experiments of the spread of the infectious disease through the passenger flow in the rail transit station were designed and carried out. The simulation results show that the CR, transmissibility, duration of infectiousness and duration of exposure have important impacts on the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
              <list list-type="order">
                <list-item>
                  <p>With increases in the CR and the transmissibility, the peak numbers of infected and exposed passengers also increased, with a shorter time needed to reach those peaks.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>The longer the duration of infectiousness was, the larger the peak numbers of infected and exposed passengers, but there was little impact on the time needed to reach those peaks.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>The longer the duration of exposure was, the larger the peak number of exposed individuals, the smaller of the peak number of infected individuals, and the longer the time needed to reach those peaks.</p>
                </list-item>
              </list>
              <p>Therefore, the peak number of affected individuals in rail transit stations can be reduced by decreasing the CR, transmissibility, duration of infectiousness and duration of exposure.</p>
              <p>The process and mechanism of the spread of an infectious disease through high-density passenger flow in a rail transit station were simulated and analyzed through the construction of this model, which provides theoretical support for the application of similar models in research on controlling the spread of infectious diseases. In addition, the research results can be used as a reference to help rail transit stations and disease control centers thoroughly understand the spread of infectious diseases in rail transit stations and formulate and implement effective disease control and prevention measures in other public places.</p>
              <p>In this study, the process by which infectious diseases spread in rail transit stations were discussed preliminarily. There were still issues need further study, such as changing the facilities and organizational mode in the station and verifying the effectiveness of prevention and control measures. The model setting does not consider the impact of the temperature and ventilation in the station on the spread of the infectious disease. In the future, the model will be improved, and many practical factors will be considered to provide evidence that can be used to inform the development of effective measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.</p>

              <p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript adopts the traditional SEIR model to simulate epidemic spread in Tianyi station at Ningbo city. The authors have conducted lots of numerical simulation, The paper is well organized and it is a interesting topic. The proposed materials and methods are described in detail afterwards. In general, I think that the article fits well into the scope of target journal. However, some revisions are required before the paper can be considered for publication.</p>
              <p>1. Please give more explain for SEIR model, such as perturbation factor.</p>
              <p>2. The discussion in the body of the manuscript is abundant and lack of logic, which makes it harded to understand. The authors need to reorganize the structure significantly.</p>
              <p>3. Please give more explain for "1000 population" in your SEIR model.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The paper simulated the spread of communicable diseases in an urban rail transit station. Data were collected by a field investigation in the city of Ningbo, China. A SEIR-based model was developed to simulate the spread of infectious diseases in Tianyi station, considering four groups of passengers (susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered) and a 14-day incubation period. Based on the historical data of infectious diseases, the parameters of the SEIR infectious disease model were clarified, and a sensitivity analysis of the parameters was also performed. The paper is clearly written and easy to understand. My comments are pointed out as follows:</p>
              <p>1.To enrich your bibliography, some important references about SEIR infectious disease model should be added.</p>
              <p>2. Please polish the quality of English language.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The article contains information technical and innovative that justifies its publication. The problem addressed is current and has technical relevance, which makes it significant. The paper is well organized and convincing. The simulation-based methodology is described as comprehensively. Interpretations and conclusions are justified by the results. The paper is well organized and convincing. My recommendations are：</p>
              <p>1. The abstract can be rewritten to be more meaningful. The authors should add more details about their final results in the abstract.</p>
              <p>2. Running a SEIR model for a 1,000 population without clear definition of the specifics of the problem is useless.</p>
              <p>3. The calibration of the model parameter is not clearly described. Please check.</p>

              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>

              <p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
