              <abstract>
                <p>Dengue is hyperendemic in Brazil, with outbreaks affecting all regions. Previous studies identified geographical barriers to dengue transmission in Brazil, beyond which certain areas, such as South Brazil and the Amazon rainforest, were relatively protected from outbreaks. Recent data shows these barriers are being eroded. In this study, we explore the drivers of this expansion and identify the current limits to the dengue transmission zone. We used a spatio-temporal additive model to explore the associations between dengue outbreaks and temperature suitability, urbanisation, and connectivity to the Brazilian urban network. The model was applied to a binary outbreak indicator, assuming the official threshold value of 300 cases per 100,000 residents, for Brazil’s municipalities between 2001 and 2020. We found a nonlinear relationship between higher levels of connectivity to the Brazilian urban network and the odds of an outbreak, with lower odds in metropoles compared to regional capitals. The number of months per year with suitable temperature conditions for <italic toggle="yes">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes was positively associated with the dengue outbreak occurrence. Temperature suitability explained most interannual and spatial variation in South Brazil, confirming this geographical barrier is influenced by lower seasonal temperatures. Municipalities that had experienced an outbreak previously had double the odds of subsequent outbreaks. We identified geographical barriers to dengue transmission in South Brazil, western Amazon, and along the northern coast of Brazil. Although a southern barrier still exists, it has shifted south, and the Amazon no longer has a clear boundary. Few areas of Brazil remain protected from dengue outbreaks. Communities living on the edge of previous barriers are particularly susceptible to future outbreaks as they lack immunity. Control strategies should target regions at risk of future outbreaks as well as those currently within the dengue transmission zone.</p>

                <p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that has expanded rapidly around the world due to increased urbanisation, global mobility and climate change. In Brazil, geographical barriers to dengue transmission exist, beyond which certain areas including South Brazil and the Amazon rainforest are relatively protected from outbreaks. However, we found that the previous barrier in South Brazil has shifted further south as a result of increased temperature suitability. The previously identified barrier protecting the western Amazon no longer exists. This is particularly concerning as we found dengue outbreaks tend to become established in areas after introduction. Highly influential cities with many transport links had increased odds of an outbreak. However, the most influential cities had lower odds of an outbreak than cities connected regionally. This study highlights the importance of monitoring the expansion of dengue outbreaks and designing disease prevention strategies for areas at risk of future outbreaks as well as areas in the established dengue transmission zone.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Dengue is considered one of the top 10 threats to global health [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], with around half the world’s population living in areas at risk of infection [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Incidence rates have doubled each decade in the past 30 years as a result of increased urbanisation, global mobility and climate change [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. All 4 dengue serotypes are endemic to Brazil, which experiences frequent outbreaks across the country [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Previous studies identified geographical barriers to dengue transmission beyond which regions were relatively protected. This included South Brazil, where seasonal temperatures are too cold for vectors to efficiently transmit the virus, areas of high altitude in Southeast Brazil and remote regions of the western Amazon [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, these barriers are being eroded and the dengue transmission area in Brazil has expanded over the past decade. This expansion is thought to be linked to increased human mobility and changes in climate [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>For dengue to become established in a new region, the environment must be suitable to support the propagation of the dengue vector, <italic toggle="yes">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. There are two vectors present in Brazil capable of transmitting the dengue virus: <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Aedes albopictus</italic>. Currently only <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> are considered responsible for dengue transmission in Brazil [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], however a recent study identified <italic toggle="yes">Aedes albopictus</italic> infected by dengue virus in a rural area of Brazil during an outbreak, which could indicate their involvement in the introduction of dengue to rural areas [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> have evolved to live in urban environments close to humans [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] but there is evidence to suggest they are becoming established in peri-urban and rural regions of South America [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Conversely, <italic toggle="yes">Aedes albopictus</italic> are typically found in peri-urban areas but have been identified in densely urbanised areas such as urban slums in Brazil [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes breed in pools of standing, clean water created by water storage containers or uncollected refuse. These conditions arise when rapid urbanisation occurs without adequate improvements to infrastructure, such as access to piped water and refuse collection [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. There is evidence that areas lacking reliable access to piped water are more susceptible to dengue outbreaks, particularly in highly urbanised areas following drought [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Prior studies have found that extremely wet conditions also increased the risk of dengue outbreaks, thought to be linked to the creation of larval habitat in the short term [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Suitable temperature conditions are required for the mosquitoes to breed and transmit the virus. <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> are unable to survive in temperatures below 10°C or above 40°C [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and can only transmit the virus between 17.8°C and 34.5°C [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Aedes albopictus</italic> are more suited to cooler temperatures and can transmit the virus between 16.2°C and 31.4°C [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Recent outbreaks in temperate cities of South America have shown that epidemics are still possible in regions that experience seasonal temperatures outside of this range due to human movement [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>The expansion of <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> and the arboviruses they transmit into rural parts of the Amazon has been linked to connections to and within the area by air, road or boat [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Despite this, the investigation of spatial connections created by human movement is little explored in the literature and the vast majority of spatial modelling studies of mosquito-borne diseases assume connectivity is based on distance alone [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Brazilian cities are connected to one another within a complex urban network, described within the Regions of influence of cities ("Regiões de Influência das Cidades”, REGIC) studies carried out by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. People often travel great distances to reach large urban centres as they contain important educational, business or cultural institutions. Failure to account for long-distance movements may miss important drivers of dengue expansion, particularly in areas such as the Amazon where the average distance travelled to Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, was 316km. Important cities can have influence over vast areas of Brazil, for example the region of influence connected to the capital city of Brasilia corresponds to over 20% of the country and spans 1.8 million km<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although previous studies have shown the expansion of dengue outbreaks in Brazil [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the association between the dengue transmission zone and climate [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], neither formally investigated the link between this expansion and human movement. In this study, we use the level of influence of cities from the REGIC studies [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] as a proxy for human movement, and aim to better understand how climate suitability, connectivity between cities and socioeconomic factors have contributed to the recent expansion of dengue. It is hoped that by understanding the drivers of dengue expansion in Brazil, we can identify its spatial trends and regions at risk from future outbreaks.</p>

                <title>Epidemiological data</title>
                <p>Brazil is the 6th most populous country in the world with an estimated population of over 212 million in 2020 [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The country can be separated into 5 distinct geo-political regions (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), 27 federal units (26 states and a federal district containing the capital city Brasilia, <xref rid="pntd.0009773.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), and 5,570 municipalities. We obtained monthly notified dengue cases for each of Brazil’s 5,570 municipalities between January 2001 and December 2020 from Brazil’s Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN), freely available via the Health Information Department, DATASUS (<ext-link xlink:href="https://datasus.saude.gov.br/informacoes-de-saude-tabnet/" ext-link-type="uri">https://datasus.saude.gov.br/informacoes-de-saude-tabnet/</ext-link>). Cases were aggregated by month of first symptom and municipality of residence. Dengue cases are considered confirmed if they test positive in a laboratory or, more commonly, based on the Ministry of Health’s syndromic definition Due to its passive nature, the accuracy of the dengue surveillance system differs between municipalities and between periods of high and low incidence [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To reduce the bias introduced by differences in case reporting and health seeking behaviour, we chose to model binary outbreak indicators rather than incidence rates because, as stated by the Brazilian Observatory of Climate and Health, "there is no way to hide an epidemic" [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Between 2001 and 2020, municipality boundaries in Brazil have changed and several new municipalities were created. To ensure data were consistent over the study period, we aggregated data to the 5,560 municipalities that were present in 2001 by combining the new municipalities with their parent municipalities. The data and code used to aggregate the dengue case data are available from <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/sophie-a-lee/Dengue_expansion" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/sophie-a-lee/Dengue_expansion</ext-link> [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>

                <title>Meteorological data</title>
                <p>Monthly mean temperatures (K) were obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’ (ECMRWF) ERA5-Land dataset [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] for the period January 2001—December 2020, at a spatial resolution of 0.1° x 0.1° (~9km). The ERA5-Land database was chosen because of its fine spatial scale, necessary when analysing small administrative units such as municipalities. Temperatures were converted from Kelvin to degrees Celsius (°C) by subtracting 273.15. Mean temperature was aggregated to each municipality using the exactextractr package [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] in R (version 4.0.3) by calculating the mean of the grid boxes lying within each municipality. Grid boxes partially covered by a municipality were weighted by the percentage of area that lay within the municipality.</p>
                <p>Due to its size, Brazil experiences a wide range of climate systems and ecosystems. The northern part of the country lies on or close to the equator, meaning regions experience year-round high temperatures. In contrast, the South and Southeast regions have clear seasonality in temperatures with cooler winters (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>), often falling below the optimal temperature range for dengue transmission (between 17.8°C and 34.5°C for <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> and 16.2°C and 31.4°C for <italic toggle="yes">Aedes albopictus</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). To understand how temperature suitability has contributed to the expansion of the dengue transmission zone in Brazil, we calculated the number of months per year each municipality lay within the suitable temperature ranges (between 16.2°C and 34.5°C). Most of Brazil experiences year-round temperature suitability except for the temperate South and mountainous regions in the Southeast (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>), although the number of months suitable has increased in these regions over the past decade (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). As <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> is the only vector proven to transmit dengue in Brazil, we also tested the number of months considered suitable for <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> transmission (between 17.8°C and 34.5°C) within the model.</p>

                <title>Urbanisation</title>
                <p>We obtained the percentage of residents in each municipality living in urban areas from the 2000 and 2010 censuses via DATASUS. In 2010, just under 85% of Brazil’s population lived in urban areas, mostly concentrated in the large cities of South and Southeast Brazil. The North region, except for some state capitals, has a larger rural population (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). The percentage of residents living in urban areas was converted to the proportion to make interpretation and comparison of model coefficients easier. Data from the 2000 census was used for the years 2001–2009 and data from 2010 was used for the years 2010–2020 to account for changes in urbanisation over the period.

                <title>Hierarchical levels of influence of cities</title>
                <p>As a proxy for human movement, we obtained the hierarchical level of influence of cities from IBGE’s REGIC studies, carried out in 2007 and 2018 [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. REGIC aims to recreate the complex urban network of Brazil using information from surveys about the frequency and reasons for the movement of people and goods around the country. Part of this study involved classifying cities based on their hierarchical level of influence within this network (see <xref rid="pntd.0009773.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref> for more details). Cities were classified into five levels:</p>
                <list list-type="order">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Metropolis: the largest cities in Brazil, with strong connections throughout the entire country. This includes São Paulo, the capital Brasilia, and Rio de Janeiro.</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>Regional capital: large cities which are connected throughout the region in which they are located and to metropoles. This includes state capitals that were not classified as metropoles, such as Rio Branco, Campo Grande and Porto Velho.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Sub-regional capital: cities with a lower level of connectivity, mostly connected locally and to the three largest metropoles.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Zone centre: smaller cities with influences restricted to their immediate area, often neighbours.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Local centre: the smallest cities in the network which typically only serve residents of the municipality and are not connected elsewhere.</p>
                  </list-item>
                </list>
                <p>The REGIC study aggregated data to population concentration areas (“Áreas de Concentração de População”, ACPs), defined in [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Smaller or isolated ACPs consisted of a single municipality, while large urban centres consisted of multiple municipalities. Levels of influence were extracted for each municipality based on the ACP they belonged to, meaning small municipalities neighbouring large cities may have a high level of influence. The distribution of highly connected urban centres is uneven across the country; the South and Southeast regions are particularly well connected, while the North and Northeast contain fewer high-level centres (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0009773.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). To account for any changes in connectivity over the study period, we used the levels extracted from the 2007 study for the years 2001–2010, and levels from the 2018 study for the years 2011–2020.</p>

                <p>To understand how the dengue transmission zone has expanded between 2001 and 2020, we aggregated dengue cases by year and created a binary outbreak indicator. We used an outbreak threshold of more than 300 cases per 100,000 residents, defined as ‘high risk’ by the Brazilian Ministry of Health [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We also tested a ‘medium risk’ indicator, defined as more than 100 cases per 100,000 residents, and a threshold defined as the 75th percentile of the dengue incidence rate between 2001–2020 for each municipality to ensure our analyses were robust to this outbreak definition. The annual dengue incidence rate was calculated using estimates of the annual population for each municipality obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography (IBGE) via DATASUS (<ext-link xlink:href="http://tabnet.datasus.gov.br/cgi/deftohtm.exe?ibge/cnv/poptbr.def" ext-link-type="uri">http://tabnet.datasus.gov.br/cgi/deftohtm.exe?ibge/cnv/poptbr.def</ext-link>). Further details about the dengue surveillance system in Brazil and outbreak definitions are given in <xref rid="pntd.0009773.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>. We formulated a binomial spatio-temporal generalised additive model (GAM) using the binary outbreak indicator as the response variable. We included the number of months per year with temperature suitable for <italic toggle="yes">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes to transmit dengue, the level of influence from REGIC, the proportion of residents living in urban areas, and a ‘prior outbreak’ indicator which took the value 0 until the year of the first outbreak in a municipality and 1 in every year after as covariates. We also considered the number of extremely wet months as a covariate, but we found this did not improve the model (further details can be found in <xref rid="pntd.0009773.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). To account for spatial and temporal patterns in the data, smooth functions of the year and the coordinates of the centroids of municipalities were included in the model (see <xref rid="pntd.0009773.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref> for further details). Inference was performed using an empirical Bayesian approach with estimates calculated using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) as part of the mgcv package in R [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
                <p>Model fit was assessed using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve which plots the true positive rate against the true negative rate at different thresholds to test the predictive ability of the model. The area under the ROC curve was calculated as this gives a measure of predictive ability compared to chance, which would return a value of 0.5. The closer the area under the ROC curve is to 1, the better the model fits the data. The predictive ability of models were also compared using the Brier score [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The Brier score is the mean squared difference between the observed and expected outcomes; a lower Brier score represents a better fitting model.</p>
                <p>To assess the relative contribution of the covariates, we compared the spatio-temporal structured residual terms between the final model and a baseline model, containing only the spatio-temporal smooth terms. If the covariates explained variation in the data, the smooth functions would shrink towards zero in the final model and the difference between the absolute estimates of these functions would be negative. To assess the contribution of the covariates over the entire period, we took the median difference for each municipality. The contribution of each individual covariate was also assessed by taking the difference between the structured residuals from the baseline model and models with each covariate added in turn.</p>
                <p>To understand how the risk of outbreaks have changed between 2001 and 2020, we drew 1000 simulations from the posterior distribution of the response and estimated the probability of an outbreak for each municipality per year. These estimates were aggregated to the first (2001–2010) and second (2011–2020) decades by taking the mean probability for each municipality per decade to observe how the dengue transmission zone had changed after the large-scale outbreak of the 21st century in 2010. The estimated probabilities were then used to determine the current dengue transmission barriers by identifying regions where the average probability of an outbreak lay below 10%, other barrier thresholds were also considered.</p>

              <p>There were 13,860,348 cases of dengue notified between January 2001 and December 2020 in Brazil. The dengue incidence rate has increased across all regions of the country (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) particularly in the Centre-West and Southeast. Outbreaks were more widespread since 2010 with around 80% of all municipalities in the Centre-West now regularly experiencing outbreaks (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Although the South had the highest incidence in 2020, this was still concentrated in a small number of municipalities in Paraná, around the fringe area of the previously identified geographical barrier. The previous barriers to dengue transmission have been eroded over the past decade. This is particularly noticeable in the western Amazon where there are now very few municipalities yet to experience an outbreak. The erosion of the barrier in the South was particularly noticeable in 2020 when it had the highest incidence rate of any region (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>), and many municipalities close to the previous barrier experienced outbreaks for the first time (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). We observed that once dengue was introduced to municipalities, the virus became established and future outbreaks were likely to occur (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>).</p>

                <p>We found municipalities that were highly urbanised, highly connected, and had temperatures suitable for dengue transmission year-round had a significantly increased odds of an outbreak (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0009773.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Municipalities that had previously experienced outbreaks had around double the odds of experiencing another compared to municipalities that were still protected (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.03, 95% credible interval (CI): 1.93, 2.15). This could indicate that the virus becomes established following its introduction, however the increased incidence may be a result of increased surveillance following an outbreak or due to the increased probability of severe cases following the introduction of new serotypes [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Municipalities with year-round temperature suitability had increased risk of outbreaks, whether we consider suitability for both species of <italic toggle="yes">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) or just <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).

This is potentially due to the structure of the urban network which connects smaller cities to larger centres until they converge to metropoles, meaning that regional capitals are important intermediate urban centres, that influences wide hinterland areas [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Alternatively, despite the regional capitals having similar levels of access to basic services as metropoles when aggregated to the municipality level (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>), metropoles have larger economies and greater access to healthcare than regional capitals [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] which may mean improved infrastructure which is not reflected by census variables on this scale.</p>

In particular, the model based on the 75th percentile produced lower coefficient estimates than the fixed threshold models, and the model using a threshold of over 100 cases per 100,000 residents estimated an increased odds following a previous outbreak compared to the primary analysis (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0009773.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).

The inclusion of temperature suitability into the baseline model shrank the structured residuals towards zero for 91.16% of municipalities. This was particularly noticeable in South Brazil (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that the dengue transmission barrier here was a result of lower temperatures. The inclusion of the prior outbreak indicator also shrank the structured residuals towards zero across Brazil (in 94.28% of municipalities, <xref rid="pntd.0009773.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>) showing its relative importance in this model. The relative importance of urbanisation and REGIC levels of influence were less clear; despite the model finding both these variables significantly associated with increased odds of an outbreak, there were fewer municipalities in which the structured residuals had shrank towards (57.5% for urbanisation, <xref rid="pntd.0009773.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>, and 45.08% for REGIC levels of influence, <xref rid="pntd.0009773.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). One potential reason for this is that both variables are only measured once per decade and therefore do not differ annually; there may be changes in municipalities that contribute to dengue transmission but are not captured by these stationary variables. Another potential reason is that these variables are not able to account for within-city variation at this spatial resolution that may contribute to outbreaks of dengue.</p>

                <title>Current barriers to dengue transmission</title>
                <p>To determine the current dengue transmission barriers, we identified regions where the average probability of an outbreak lay below 10% (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>). We chose the threshold 10% as this gave barriers comparable to those identified in a previous study [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). The number of municipalities considered protected declined from 2689 in 2001–2010 to 1599 in 2011–2020. Between 2011 and 2020 there were no municipalities in the Centre-West region that were considered protected, compared to 92 in 2001–2010. Northeast Brazil was the only region that had more protected municipalities in 2011–2020 than 2001–2020 (366 compared to 315). The southern barrier to dengue transmission now begins in the southern part of Paraná and extends through the west of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. Areas of high altitude in Southeast Brazil, mostly found in Minas Gerais, are still considered protected. There are still areas of the Amazon protected from dengue outbreaks, but this barrier is no longer clearly defined. In addition to the previously identified barriers in the South region and Amazon rainforest, we found that there was a protected region along the north coast of Brazil in northern Pará and Maranhão. This barrier was not explained by the covariates in our model indicated by the low values of the spatial smooth function (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). This area is predominantly warm and humid climate, with higher precipitation during winter (‘Am’ type in Köppen climate classification) [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Although temperature and humidity are relatively stable along seasons in this area, the interaction between these variables and increased precipitation may inhibit the mosquito populations [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We found that the expansion of the dengue transmission zone is associated with temperature suitability, connectivity within the Brazilian urban network and urbanisation, and that the odds of future outbreaks significantly increase after both the vector and the virus have been introduced. This study builds on previous literature that showed the expansion of dengue across Brazil [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and has updated the geographical barriers to transmission. The most recent epidemiological bulletins have shown that this expansion has continued in 2021 into previously unaffected parts of Acre, Amazonas, and further south into Paraná and Santa Catarina [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], highlighting the importance of monitoring the erosion of these barriers. To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological modelling study to use the REGIC’s levels of influence and show that there is an increased odds of dengue outbreaks in cities that are highly connected within the Brazilian urban network. However, this increase is not linear; regional capitals are considered less connected than metropoles but we found that the increase in odds were higher in these cities. Further investigation is needed to understand whether this is related to human movement, as people more often travel to regional capitals from smaller cities than metropoles [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], or differences in socioeconomic factors and health-seeking behaviour that we were unable to detect at the municipality level.</p>
              <p>Although this study focuses on Brazil, there is evidence that similar patterns are emerging in other parts of South America. In Argentina, previously protected cities in temperate regions are experiencing regular outbreaks, partially related to increasing temperatures but also as a result of human movement importing cases from other parts of the continent [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Rural parts of the Amazon, which were previously isolated from infected hosts and vectors, are also experiencing outbreaks, thought to be associated with increased connectivity between rural areas and larger cities [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The introduction of dengue into Acre in the Brazilian Amazon has been linked to increased connectivity across the state following the construction of a highway between the two largest cities, Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The impact of this connection can be observed in the data as the outbreak appears to jump from Rio Branco in the south of Acre to Cruzeiro do Sul in the north in 2014 rather than spreading to neighbouring regions which appears to be the case in the South (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). The introduction of dengue into the Amazon is particularly worrying as it is the ideal environment for the virus to thrive: lower than average access to basic services such piped water and refuse collection, and the ideal climate conditions for large epidemics [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although this study extends our understanding of the expansion of the dengue transmission zone in Brazil, there are several limitations. Dengue case data used in this study was taken from Brazil’s passive surveillance system, which has been found to differ in accuracy between regions, and between epidemic and non-epidemic periods [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To reduce the impact of reporting bias in our model, we used an outbreak indicator rather than case data as a response variable. The outbreak indicator used was chosen as it reflects the Brazilian Ministry of Health’s definition [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, the threshold of an outbreak is likely to differ across the country. In regions that historically experienced little or no transmission, even a small number of cases may be viewed as an outbreak. The choice of such a high threshold is likely to produce more conservative estimates of the transmission zone. When our results were compared to a lower outbreak threshold of 100 cases per 100,000 residents, we found the model conclusions were consistent with the higher threshold. We found that both models using a fixed threshold outperformed the model based on the 75th percentile based on the area under the ROC curve (<xref rid="pntd.0009773.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>) and the Brier score. The model failed to pick up some of the temporal trends in the data, which may be a result of using stationary indicators of urbanisation and connectivity measured every 10 years. Information collected at a finer temporal scale may provide more insights into the impact of sudden expansions such as the effect of improved infrastructure in the Amazon [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our model used the level of influence extracted from the REGIC studies [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] to account for the level of connectivity between cities within Brazil as a proxy for human movement. However, this indicator may simplify the process and miss important patterns. The hierarchical model assumed by REGIC assumes each small city is linked to a higher-level urban centre, such as the regional capitals and metropoles. It is evident that large and warm cities may propagate epidemic waves and maintain dengue transmission in their hinterland, while temperate metropoles in the South (Porto Alegre, Curitiba and São Paulo) do not play a relevant role in dengue diffusion in their region. Previous studies have found that imported cases driven by human movement are responsible for dengue outbreaks in temperate cities [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The choice of spatial connectivity assumption and data can lead to very different results and the use of the REGIC levels of influence as a spatial covariate rather than including the direct links may miss some important patterns [<xref rid="pntd.0009773.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Future work will aim to incorporate the complex urban network from the REGIC studies into a statistical framework to account for direct and indirect links between metropoles and regional capitals, and smaller urban centres in their hinterland.</p>
              <p>Despite these limitations, we have shown that the expansion of the dengue transmission zone has continued into the 21st century, driven by increased temperature suitability in the South, a network of highly connected cities, and high levels of urbanisation. The introduction of dengue outbreaks into an area more than doubles the odds of future outbreaks, which is particularly concerning given the expansion has continued into 2021. Given the dynamic nature of the growing dengue burden, the barriers identified here will be outdated very quickly. We have highlighted the importance of focusing control strategies in areas at risk of future outbreaks as well as those within the established dengue transmission zone.</p>

              <p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p>
              <p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors only explored one environmental factor, which is temperature suitability, for explaining the expansion of dengue. Other climatic factors such as rainfall and humidity may also impact the Aedes aegypti vector population. Please explain the rationale behind choosing temperature as the only environmental factor here. </p>
              <p>The study created a binary outbreak indicator based on case counts in the dengue surveillance system in Brazil as the response variable of the GAM model. Please comment on how the surveillance system is sensitive to change in health seeking behavior or access to healthcare over time, and how it may impact the model output.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: The results are clear overall. One minor comment is that under "model result" on line 309, the authors stated that the increased OR suggests that dengue becomes established once the virus is introduced. It would be helpful to present dynamics of the four circulating serotypes otherwise the statement may be a stretch.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Review PNTD The impact of climate suitability, urbanisation, and connectivity on the expansion of dengue in 21st century Brazil </p>
              <p>This study aims at exploring the changes in transmission in Brazilian regions. The goal is to identify the new limits to dengue presence in Brazilian regions and exploring the drivers of dengue expansion using a statistical model. This is a well-written, interesting study with clear assumptions and methodology. I was not familiar with the literature on the association of human transportation networks and dengue spread in Brazil, but the background and approach used were explained very clearly, although I would have liked to understand more what caused differences between urban centers. The analyses and figures are very informative. My only concern is with the choice of threshold as the response variable in the model. I would like to have a better understanding of the choice of incidence chosen, and I would like to see a better comparison between models with different threshold choices. Could we see a sensitivity analysis exploring the impact of 300 cases per 100,000 with other thresholds’ choices (20, 50, etc.) and formal model comparisons? Apart from this I only have a few suggestions. </p>
              <p>A few minor points:</p>
              <p>l.126-7. Reference for rank of country by human population size needed.</p>
              <p>l.140: I could not find the code associated with this link.</p>
              <p>l.254-256: Not sure I understand the choice of threshold explored in this analysis. I would appreciate if this could this be specified in the methodology section and in the figure S9 legend. What is the impact of a lower threshold 30, 50 per 100,00?</p>
              <p>l.273: There are many supplementary figures references. It would be helpful to order the plots in the Supplementary material in the order they appear in the text, e.g., here S8 could be ranked S5 and so on.</p>
              <p>l.279: I’m not convinced figure 5 is useful to support this statement. I suggest either removing the sentence and figure or refer to table 1/figure 6 as they present strong evidence of the impact of previous outbreaks.</p>
              <p>l.306-307: As I said before, my only reserve for this part of the analysis is that it is dependent on the quantitative choice of threshold. I would be interested in seeing a formal quantitative analysis of the relationship between incidence threshold and the likelihood of having more outbreak of similar strength (or at least seeing better support for this choice). </p>
              <p>l.313-314: I’m not sure there is a strong enough evidence of a higher risk of outbreak after an outbreak year. The risk seems to be lower compared to the model with an outbreak any previous year. Could it be outbreaks that overlap over two calendar years instead of a higher risk of outbreak after an outbreak year? A cautious reformulation of this sentence or better explaining the limits of this analysis could help.</p>
              <p>l. 340-349: Could it be that other confounders exists that may affect dengue reporting rates? E.g., regional centers having a higher number of doctors per capita than metropoles? </p>
              <p>l.351-352. I agree that the models reach to the same conclusions, but I do see differences in the parameter estimates where the estimates for some models were not within the bounds of the main model. Also, I am curious what the ROC figure (S9) looks like for the other model formulations (100 per 100,000 incidence, model with each covariate), could they be plotted in dashed or grey-ish line?</p>
              <p>l. 354-358: Very informative part of the analysis! I really appreciate the information and the visualization of the spatially heterogeneous risk of dengue outbreak. </p>
              <p>l. 375: In some instances, “climate suitability” is used but temperature suitability may be more appropriate as the temperature is the only variable used for this parameter estimate (and the words "temperature suitability" are used in the methods section). </p>
              <p>l.407-409: Methods for this analysis? Since the figures for this analysis are presented in the main text the methods, could be found in the methods section of the main text?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Study by Lee et al. built upon previous literature that showed geographic expansion of dengue transmission in Brazil, and it updated the changing geographic barrier to dengue transmission in Brazil. It explored several drivers behind such expansion and provided additional evidence on the impact of temperature suitability and urbanization on dengue outbreaks in Brazil. The manuscript is well-written and has important policy implications.</p>

              <p>Data Requirements:</p>
              <p>Please note that, as a condition of publication, PLOS' data policy requires that you make available all data used to draw the conclusions outlined in your manuscript. Data must be deposited in an appropriate repository, included within the body of the manuscript, or uploaded as supporting information. This includes all numerical values that were used to generate graphs, histograms etc.. For an example see here: <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001908#s5" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001908#s5</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>Reproducibility:</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
              <p>References</p>
              <p>Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript. If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article's retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p>

              <p>Dear Ms Lee,</p>
              <p>We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript 'The impact of climate suitability, urbanisation, and connectivity on the expansion of dengue in 21st century Brazil' has been provisionally accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
              <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. A member of our team will be in touch with a set of requests.</p>
              <p>Please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes, so a swift response is appreciated.</p>
              <p>IMPORTANT: The editorial review process is now complete. PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling, formatting or significant scientific errors from this point onwards. Requests for major changes, or any which affect the scientific understanding of your work, will cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript.</p>
              <p>Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us now if you or your institution is planning to press release the article. All press must be co-ordinated with PLOS.</p>
              <p>Thank you again for supporting Open Access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
              <p>Best regards,</p>

              <p>Dear Ms Lee,</p>
              <p>We are delighted to inform you that your manuscript, "The impact of climate suitability, urbanisation, and connectivity on the expansion of dengue in 21st century Brazil," has been formally accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
              <p>We have now passed your article onto the PLOS Production Department who will complete the rest of the publication process. All authors will receive a confirmation email upon publication.</p>
              <p>The corresponding author will soon be receiving a typeset proof for review, to ensure errors have not been introduced during production. Please review the PDF proof of your manuscript carefully, as this is the last chance to correct any scientific or type-setting errors. Please note that major changes, or those which affect the scientific understanding of the work, will likely cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript. Note: Proofs for Front Matter articles (Editorial, Viewpoint, Symposium, Review, etc...) are generated on a different schedule and may not be made available as quickly.</p>
              <p>Soon after your final files are uploaded, the early version of your manuscript will be published online unless you opted out of this process. The date of the early version will be your article's publication date. The final article will be published to the same URL, and all versions of the paper will be accessible to readers.</p>
              <p>Thank you again for supporting open-access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. </p>
