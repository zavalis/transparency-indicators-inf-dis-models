                  <p>Epidemiological surveillance data for non-human H7N9 avian influenza from April 2013 to April 2020 were used to analyse the regional distribution and spatial correlations of positivity rates in different months and years and before and after comprehensive immunisation.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>H7N9 avian influenza is a disease caused by the novel H7N9 recombinant avian influenza virus, which is mainly characterised by pulmonary inflammation and fever (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In early 2013, human infection with H7N9 avian influenza virus was discovered for the first time in China. Subsequently, birds infected with the virus were found in live poultry markets (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). At the beginning of 2017, a highly pathogenic variant of it was found in poultry flocks in some Chinese provinces, which then caused a number of outbreaks (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In order to control H7N9 avian influenza in commercial flocks, China imposed treatment with a bivalent inactivated vaccine of recombinant avian influenza virus (H5+H7) in September 2017 (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Both low-pathogenic and high-pathogenic strains of H7N9 avian influenza virus coexist and are still evolving at present (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Therefore, the risk of its spread among various animals is not countered fully by vaccination and should not be ignored.</p>
              <p>It is very important to construct predictive models for the early detection of H7N9 outbreaks (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and many studies have established them. For example, Gilbert <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) constructed a spatial econometric model to predict the risk of H7N9 avian influenza infection in live poultry markets in Asia, Young <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) constructed a niche model to predict the prevalence of H5N1 and H9N2 avian influenza in poultry flocks, and Li <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) developed a Bayesian inference system to predict the infection rate of H7N9 also in poultry flocks. Qiang and Kou (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) used the wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) method to predict the transmission of avian influenza virus between humans and various poultry species, Walsh <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) adopted the gradient-boosted tree to build a model for predicting the probability of isolating avian influenza virus from wild bird samples, and lastly, Yang <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) predicted the spread of H9N2 avian influenza with a system dynamics model. Although these previous studies achieved good results, most of them adopted the single-model prediction method. However, avian influenza virus infection is a complex biochemical process, characterised by periodicity, complexity and nonlinearity, which underscore the need for a combined model based on modern prediction theory to improve prediction accuracy (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>
              <p>Continuous monitoring of the distribution and changes in the positivity rates of H7N9 avian influenza virus has been significant for eliminating infection sources (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Positive virus detection indicates viral infection in poultry, and the higher the positivity rate (number of positive results/number of samples), the greater the avian influenza virus infection (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Infected poultry have been the main source of avian influenza virus. After infection, the poultry shed the virus through saliva, nasal secretions and faeces, causing the spread of the epidemic (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Also, it is possible that contacts of domestic poultry with migratory birds, which are natural reservoirs for avian influenza viruses, are a potential source of infection (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Relevant studies have shown that the rate of avian influenza virus detection correlated with outbreaks to some extent, <italic toggle="yes">i.e</italic>. the higher the positive rate, the greater the possibility of an outbreak (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Some studies have used positive samples of H7N9 to analyse the transmission regularity of the virus (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and to judge the effect of closing live poultry markets (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and comprehensive H7N9 immunisation of at-risk animals (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>
              <p>China has been a major exporter of poultry products, the trade in which may spread domestic avian influenza virus to importing countries (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Furthermore, there is a wide range and distribution of bird migrations within and in proximity to China, which possibly causes the spread of domestic avian influenza to neighbouring countries (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The outbreak risk of H7N9 avian influenza related to China has obliged the Chinese government to employ effective preparedness measures, including early detection and timely sharing of surveillance data (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People’s Republic of China has organised provincial veterinary departments to conduct special surveillance efforts against H7N9 avian influenza. Since April 2013, fixed virus monitoring points have been established on each province’s poultry farms and commercial livestock farms and in pig slaughterhouses and wild bird habitats. The collected samples are sent to the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory for testing. When a virus detection in animal or environmental samples occurs, a retrospective investigation is carried out in accordance with guidelines issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs to identify the source of the virus and possible contaminated sites and implement culling or treatment of pathogen-positive poultry flocks (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). As the official monitoring data are relatively authoritative, some studies have tried to use the annual avian influenza monitoring data of the United States (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) or Southeast Asia (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) to predict the prevalence of the virus. This study regards China and also employs national monitoring data for the virus positivity rates to analyse the distribution characteristics of positive samples and construct a predictive model conforming to the trend of changes in the positive rate. We believe that this study has novelty and important practical significance for improving the prediction of major animal epidemics and curbing the spread of the virus. It could also provide an important insight into how the global known and future zoonotic influenza threats may be reduced.</p>

              <title>Material and Methods</title>
              <p>Monitoring efforts for H7N9 avian influenza by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People’s Republic of China involve collecting chicken, duck, goose, wild bird and pig samples from certain sites for serological and pathogenic analysis. It should be noted that since September 2017, China has implemented comprehensive H7N9 immunisation for all domestic poultry operations, and the original positivity rate of serological samples has been replaced by a qualified rate. Consequently, the statistical calibre of pathogenic monitoring data has not changed, so the data could be used as an observation indicator of positivity rates. The rates in samples from surveillance for this pathogen from April 2013 to April 2020 were collected from information published by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (see Supplementary Materials for details of raw data). In addition, the affected species, number of H7N9 avian influenza outbreaks, number of cases, number of fatalities and number of culled animals reported by the provinces were obtained from the animal epidemic monthly report in the ministry’s Veterinary Bulletin (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In order to have a clear understanding of the distribution pattern of non-human H7N9 virus detections in China and to conduct spatial autocorrelation analysis, the monthly positive rates greater than 0 were all set to 1, indicating that H7N9 virus had been detected. A value of 0 means that no virus detections were reported.</p>
              <p><bold>Moran’s <italic toggle="yes">I</italic></bold>. “Spatial autocorrelation” usually describes the correlation among the values of a given variable with respect to a dependence on the relative locations between spatial units (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). If “neighbours” tend to have similar values, it is generally accepted as a positive spatial autocorrelation and it is a negative spatial autocorrelation if they tend to have dissimilar values. One of the most prominent measures of spatial autocorrelation is Moran’s <italic toggle="yes">I</italic> index (MI), which is defined as the ratio between the local and global coherence (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
              <p><bold>Least squares support</bold>-<bold>vector machines model</bold>. Our study adopted ArcGIS 10.2 software (Environmental System Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA) and MI to analyse the spatial correlation between the number of months of H7N9 avian influenza virus detection in different provinces. The MI values ranged from −1 to 1. Standardised statistics of Z and P values are generally used to test the significance of the spatial correlation.</p>
              <p><bold>Wavelet packet decomposition</bold>. WPD is a method for decomposing the high-frequency signal obtained by wavelet transform layer by layer. Theoretically, the effective information in a signal can be extracted by WPD into three layers (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_fig_001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, the signal Y = (0,0) represents the original data of positive rates of avian influenza virus detections. If the original data are non-stationary, they could be mapped into 2<sup>3</sup> subspaces by three-level WPD, from low to high frequency from left to right. Y = (0, 1) and Y = (1, 0) respectively represent the low-frequency and high-frequency components obtained from the first decomposition of the original data. Y = (2, 0) and Y = (2, 1) represent the low-frequency component obtained in the first decomposition, and then the low-frequency and high-frequency components are obtained in the second decomposition, and finally the data are decomposed into a low-frequency trend sequence and a high-frequency trend sequence.</p>

              <p>Least squares support-vector machines (LS-SVM) is a simplified and improved version of the standard SVM model. Its greatest advantage is dealing with non-stationary series and overcoming the problem of overestimated prediction results from traditional prediction methods (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In this paper, Matlab 2018a software (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and LS-SVM lab Toolbox version 1.8 (http://www.esat.kuleuven.be/sista/lssvmlab) were used to model the positive sequence data of avian influenza virus. The algorithm principle is as follows:</p>

              <p>In the formula, σ is the hyperparameter of the radial basis function kernel.</p>
              <p><bold>Particle swarm optimisation algorithm</bold>. The prediction effect of the LS-SVM model is affected by the penalty factor C and the kernel function σ. If the values of C and σ are improper, then overlearning can easily occur, which is not conducive to sample regression. Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is an intelligent algorithm based on population search, which is used to optimise the parameters of the LS-SVM model due to its simplicity and lack of many parameters that need to be adjusted. Our study intended to use the PSO algorithm source code of Matlab 2018a software to optimise the parameters of the LS-SVM model. The algorithm principle of PSO is as follows (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>): a group of random particles is first initialised, and then the characteristics of the particles are represented by position, speed and fitness. The particles update the speed and position according to the formulas, and they are substituted into the optimisation objective function to calculate the corresponding fitness value in order to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages. In each iteration, particles are updated by the individual extremum <italic toggle="yes">Pbest</italic> and the population extremum <italic toggle="yes">Gbest</italic>. The individual extremum <italic toggle="yes">Pbest</italic> is the position with the best fitness value which the particle has had, while the population extremum <italic toggle="yes">Gbest</italic> is the best position which all particles in the group have had. These two extrema are used for the particle to find the optimal position in each iteration process, and then the particle will update the speed and fitness.</p>

              <p><bold>Autoregressive integrated moving average model</bold>. In this article, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was constructed by Eviews 10.0 software (IHS Markit, London, UK) combined with the time series of positivity rates of avian influenza virus. The model is a linear combination of past errors and past values of a stationary time series. It is a classical time series analysis method with high short-term prediction accuracy (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The general mathematical expression is as follows:</p>

              <p><bold>Situation of H7N9 avian influenza epidemic in China</bold>. The first case of H7N9 avian influenza came to notice in Inner Mongolian chickens in June 2017, and a total of 10 outbreaks of H7N9 avian influenza had occurred by April 2020 (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_tab_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among them, there were 4, 5 and 1 outbreak of H7N9 avian influenza in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The epidemic in 2017 was the most serious, with the largest number of cases, fatalities and culled animals. In terms of the number of provinces, the most were affected in 2018. From the perspective of time, H7N9 avian influenza occurrences were mainly concentrated in a March-to-June period, in which June was the month with the largest number of outbreaks, cases, fatalities and culled animals. Chickens were vulnerable to avian influenza, and 90% of the outbreaks were related to this species. Once the poultry got sick, the mortality rate was relatively high, usually approximately 70%.</p>

In 2013, the virus was mainly detected in southeast China, and by 2016 the positive rate had reduced. Due to the large number of live poultry markets and frequent migration of wild birds, the time span of H7N9 virus detections in animals in Guangdong province exceeded six months in each year from 2013 to 2016. In 2017, owing to the coexistence of low pathogenicity and high pathogenicity H7N9 influenza virus strains in various animals, the area of virus detection expanded, and the number of areas with virus detections recorded for more than six months increased to an unprecedented level. In 2018, only three southern provinces were found to be positive for the virus, while in 2019, the detection areas were mainly in Inner Mongolia and Liaoning provinces, and after 2020, no virus was detected.</p>

This pattern indicates that the H7N9 virus was most prevalent in late spring and early summer. Although the temperature increased in this period, there was still a high risk of H7N9 outbreak in animals.</p>

              <p>As can be seen in <xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_fig_005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, before the national animal comprehensive H7N9 immunisation programme began in September 2017, most regions were positive for H7N9 virus, especially Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang. The cumulative positive rate of H7N9 avian influenza virus was more than 10 months in these provinces. After immunisation, the poultry produced antibodies, which reduced the positivity rate. Other than Fujian province, there were no areas where H7N9 avian influenza virus had been detected for more than four months. This indicates that the comprehensive H7N9 immunisation effort had a significant effect on reducing the positivity rate of H7N9 avian influenza.</p>

              <p><bold>Modelling of low</bold>-<bold>frequency trend sequence of positive rates of H7N9 avian influenza virus</bold>. The LS-SVM model parameter optimisation calculation was used on the four low-frequency trend sequences of [3,0], [3,1], [3,2] and [3,3] by the PSO algorithm. The specific steps are as follows: first, the order of the model was adopted to determine the influence of the positive rates for the previous months on the positive rate of the current year. The minimum mean square deviation of the predicted results was taken as the standard for further order expansion. By calculation, the final order of the model was 12, indicating that the current data in the sequence were closely related to the data of the previous 12 months (the 12-month data from before April 2019). Therefore, the data from May 2018 to April 2019 were used as the input values of the LS-SVM model to predict the data for May 2019 to April 2020. Then the PSO algorithm was used to optimise the hyperparameters σ and normalisation parameters <italic toggle="yes">ɣ</italic> of the radial basis function kernel of the model. The search ranges of the two parameters were set to 10<sup>−12</sup>–1012. The optimal combination of the two parameters was obtained which is shown in <xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_tab_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.</p>

Although the LS-SVM-ARIMA model had the advantages of both the ARIMA model and the LS-SVM model, the LS-SVM-ARIMA combined model based on WPD could more comprehensively extract the detailed information contained in the time series, so it better reflected the law of the positive rate change with time, and predicted the positive rate more accurately.</p>

              <p>The LS-SVM-ARIMA combined model based on WPD was a beneficial enhancement for the more accurate prediction of the positivity rate for H7N9 avian influenza virus. However, the prediction results of LS-SVM-ARIMA based on WPD model were not fully consistent with the real values. This difference arises because although the monitoring data of positivity rates are applicable to predicting the presence of avian influenza virus, they are limited by the number of monitoring sites and the effectiveness of sample collection nationwide. In addition, the virus-positive rate is cross-influenced by many factors, so it is difficult for a single data source to reflect the full complexity of the epidemic facts. Astill <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) suggested that monitoring data, internet data and environmental data should be integrated to support the construction of an avian influenza prediction model. Therefore, we can propose a few improvements to the predictive ability for the positivity rate (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Although the combined model has a better predictive ability than the single model generally, more combined models need to be produced and the prediction results compared among them, so as to further verify the effectiveness of the combined model based on WPD (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Expanding the scope of monitoring, increasing the number of monitoring points, and improving the efficiency of sample collection and detection are necessary to make the published data more accurate (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2021-0034_ref_003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Predicting positive rates for the virus in all provinces will gradually facilitate the elimination of H7N9 avian influenza in different regions.</p>
              <p>According to the monitoring data from April 2013 to April 2020, there was a greater risk of epidemics in late spring and early summer. After livestock at risk was comprehensively immunised against H7N9, the positive rates of infection with the virus were significantly reduced. Except for 2015 and December of each year, the positive samples did not have spatial clustering and were randomly distributed. Therefore, it is recommended that live poultry markets be closed in late spring and early summer, comprehensive animal H7N9 immunisation be continued, and monitoring programs strengthened. Although the tested positivity rate of the virus during 2020 was lower than in recent years, H7N9 avian influenza may still threaten the poultry industry in China. Even with the measures of market closure, immunisation, and vigilant monitoring, H7N9 will not cease to be a latent threat and prediction capability is highly desirable for preparedness for this threat. Therefore, our epidemiological survey proposed a combined LS-SVM-ARIMA model based on WPD to improve predictive accuracy. The MAE of 2.4% and RMSE of 2.0% prove the validity of this new prediction method.</p>
