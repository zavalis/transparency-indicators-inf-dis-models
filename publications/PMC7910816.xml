              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p><italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection (CDI) is a major infection associated with health care, and its containment is considered a public health priority.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In health care settings, <italic>C difficile</italic> transmission is believed to occur primarily through the physical interactions among patients, health care workers, visitors, and the environment. Recent guidelines from leading infectious diseases societies recommend several infection control interventions to curtail <italic>C difficile</italic> transmission.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Thus, many institutions have developed CDI prevention bundles, which incorporate multiple intervention strategies simultaneously. Implementing complex bundles with high fidelity requires extensive resources.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> However, infection control programs are markedly underfunded at hospitals, with only half of hospitals budgeting money specifically for an infection control department.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In the setting of known financial constraints, it is crucial to identify and prioritize the most promising interventions to reduce hospital-onset CDI (HO-CDI).</p>
              <p>Prevention bundles for CDI typically include a visitor contact precautions (VCPs) component, which requires visitors to don gowns and gloves when entering the room of a patient with CDI. In a recent survey of 245 North American hospitals, 71% offered education materials to visitors about contact precautions for <italic>C difficile</italic> and 82% had specific contact-precaution policies for visitors of patients with CDI.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The 2014 infectious diseases guidelines consider the use of contact precautions for visitors who enter the room of a patient with CDI as an unresolved issue without substantial supporting evidence; infection control guidelines recommend the use of VCPs for patients with CDI but also note a lack of supporting evidence.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The 2017 infectious diseases guidelines specifically recommend contact precautions for health care workers.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Using contact precautions for patients with CDI when they are cared for by health care workers is essential to reduce transmission from patient to patient and from patient to health care worker. However, visitors, unlike health care workers, do not interact with multiple patients and do not usually participate in the physical care of the patient. Thus, the benefit of VCPs is unclear. Moreover, VCPs may be associated with adverse effects for patients if their visitors are required to don gowns and gloves before interacting with them. Unlike many other infection control interventions, in addition to the cost and resource implications, there may be an association between quality of life and contact precautions.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Some studies have reported increased delirium and depression in patients for whom contact precautions are used; other studies have not found such an association.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> It is possible that adverse effects associated with contact precautions are increased by VCPs because isolating patients from their visiting family and friends could be distressing. Receiving visitors has been shown to be associated with greater satisfaction with health care among patients, but patients under contact precautions may receive a smaller number of visitors.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Any potential benefits associated with VCPs must be considered in the context of detriments in patient outcomes. The risks and costs associated with VCPs in typical conditions may outweigh the benefits for 2 other health care–associated infections: methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus</italic> (VRE) infections. Recent guidelines recommend against VCPs for endemic MRSA and VRE infections because these infections are prevalent in the community.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Data on the association of VCPs with CDI transmission are essential to guide decision-making regarding this intervention. To our knowledge, no study has estimated the association of VCPs with hospital-onset CDI. The purpose of this study was to use simulation modeling to estimate the association between VCPs and HO-CDI. Estimating this association was challenging because it may differ according to hospital and community characteristics. For example, there is likely a differential association of VCPs with the rate of HO-CDI in a hospital where most patients are susceptible to CDI compared with a hospital where a small proportion of the patients are susceptible. Simulation modeling is inherently able to test large numbers of configurations, and as such, it is a useful alternative to conventional epidemiologic studies in this context.</p>

                <p>The model represented the CDI status of the patients using 1 of 9 possible disease states. The model updated the clinical state of each patient in the hospital every 6 hours using a discrete-time Markov chain structure (eTable 1 and the eFigure in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI210023-1-s">Supplement</xref>). Patients in the colonized, infected, recolonized, or recurrent infection states can transmit <italic>C difficile</italic> to other agents and the environment through interactions with them. Visitors, nurses, and physicians who are contaminated with <italic>C difficile</italic> from patients or the environment can in turn transmit <italic>C difficile</italic> to other susceptible patients and the environment. Similarly, any agent interacting with a contaminated environment can become exposed to <italic>C difficile</italic>. The probability of transmission for each interaction depends on the agent types involved and the duration of the interaction.

                <p>The initial model was developed using NetLogo software, version 5.3.1 (Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling, Northwestern University) and subsequently translated into the Java programming language (Oracle Corp) for faster speeds and flexibility as described in the eAppendix and eTables 3-7 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI210023-1-s">Supplement</xref>.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> All experiments were conducted using the Java version of the model.

                <title>Visitor Agent Logic</title>
                <p>On each day in the simulation, there was a probability that a patient received up to 2 visitors. Visitors did not interact with other patients or health care workers in the hospital. Visitors could become transiently exposed to and contagious with <italic>C difficile</italic> through interactions with the patient with whom they visited and with contaminated environments. The probability of visitor exposure to <italic>C difficile</italic> in a patient room increased with the visit duration and depended on the transfer efficiency between surfaces. Visitors could wash their hands after exiting from the patient room according to hand hygiene recommendations regardless of VCP use. Visitors exited the hospital through a ward common room, which they contaminated with probability dependent on their length of stay in the common room. The baseline model assumed that visitors remained in the common room for 5 minutes before exiting. Each ward common room may also have been used by patients staying within the same ward. Therefore, a patient may have become exposed to <italic>C difficile</italic> through a common area contaminated by a visitor. Environment-to-agent contamination was possible through high-touch surfaces, which represent a portion of the room. Common rooms may have been cleaned daily depending on compliance with the bleach cleaning intervention. We assumed that visitors were healthy adults who were not colonized or infected with <italic>C difficile</italic>. Therefore, visitors could not shed <italic>C difficile</italic> but could expose and contaminate the environment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi210023f2">Figure 2</xref> shows the logic governing visitor actions in the simulation, and the eAppendix in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI210023-1-s">Supplement</xref> further describes visitor-agent logic.</p>

                <p>We ran 5000 replications for each scenario to obtain stable estimates. Means and 95% CIs were calculated for all experiments. We used the SciPy Stats package (Enthought, Inc) to build 95% CIs with the Python programming language.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> We considered the association of VCPs with HO-CDI to be negligible if the difference between the control and experimental means was less than 1%.</p>

              <p>The overall baseline rate of HO-CDI when all model input parameters were set at baseline and VCPs were deimplemented was 7.94 per 10 000 patient-days (95% CI, 7.91-7.98 per 10 000 patient-days). This changed to 7.97 per 10 000 patient-days (95% CI, 7.93-8.01 per 10 000 patient-days) with VCPs implemented at the ideal level (<xref rid="zoi210023t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The association between VCPs and HO-CDI rates followed expected trends. For example, an increased proportion of susceptible patients (HO-CDI rate with VCPs deimplemented, 17.18 per 10 000 patient-days; 95% CI, 17.13-17.24 per 10 000 patient-days), lower hand-hygiene compliance among health care workers (HO-CDI rate with VCPs deimplemented, 14.43 per 10 000 patient-days; 95% CI, 14.38-14.48 per 10 000 patient-days), and lower environmental cleaning compliance (HO-CDI rate with VCPs deimplemented, 11.32 per 10 000 patient-days; 95% CI, 11.28-11.37 per 10 000 patient-days) were associated with higher estimated rates of HO-CDI. Across all experiments, VCPs were associated with a change of less than 1% in the rates of HO-CDI (<xref rid="zoi210023t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The experiments varying the proportion of susceptible, colonized, and infected patients at admission, which correspond to assumptions regarding the prevalence of CDI in the community, suggested that the association between VCPs and HO-CDI was negligible across all admission populations. The reduction in HO-CDI rates was less than 1% even in the worst-case scenario.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the association of VCPs with HO-CDI rates. This simulation study suggests that VCPs have a minimal association with the overall HO-CDI rate and that similar benefits could be obtained by increasing compliance with core infection-control interventions. such as health care workers’ hand hygiene or environmental cleaning. The VCPs were not associated with a great reduction in HO-CDI using simulation models with any of the examined hospital configurations or patient profiles. The adaptability of this model may enable these experiments to be run for different hospital configurations and may help estimate the association between VCPs and HO-CDI in specific settings.</p>
              <p>Because no previous study, to our knowledge, has evaluated the association of VCPs with HO-CDI, direct comparison with previous studies was not possible. However, multiple studies<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> have described the harms associated with contact precautions for patients. Previous studies reported increased delirium and depression associated with contact precautions.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Patients under contact precautions also reported lower care satisfaction.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> It is likely that these negative outcomes are associated with the use of VCPs.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Other studies have questioned the effectiveness of VCPs for MRSA and VRE infections.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The 2015 Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) report<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> states that VCPs are an ineffective intervention because of the high prevalence of MRSA and VRE in the community. As community spread is increasingly recognized in the context of <italic>C difficile,</italic> with some studies noting a general increase in community-onset CDI since the early 1990s, a similar phenomenon may explain the potential low impact of VCPs.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The SHEA guidelines<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> also suggest that visitor behavior, particularly that visitors normally do not interact with multiple patients, may be a reason why this intervention is associated with little reduction in rates of HO-CDI.</p>
              <p>High fidelity and sustained implementation of VCPs require considerable resources. The SHEA guidelines<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> report the difficulty of educating visitors and enforcing compliance with contact-precaution practices as reasons against the use of contact precautions among visitors of patients with MRSA and VRE infection. These reasons likely generalize to <italic>C difficile</italic> because the recommended gowns, gloves, and visitor education for MRSA and VRE infections are similar to those for CDI.</p>
              <p>Our findings may have implications for health care institutions, infection prevention programs, and clinicians. The minimal changes to the baseline HO-CDI rate associated with VCPs suggest that any restrictions regarding visitor length of stay or number of visitors allowed may be relaxed with minimal change in HO-CDI rates. Removing VCPs for CDI control may also be associated with decreased health care worker burden related to enforcing and managing compliance with VCPs, allowing additional time and effort to be allocated toward more effective interventions.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> These interventions include hand hygiene of health care workers and environmental cleaning, which have consistently been associated with significant decreases in HO-CDI.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The personal protective equipment (PPE) resources saved by removing VCPs can also be used to improve PPE inventory for use during acute infectious outbreaks. For example, in the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, guaranteeing PPE to health professionals became a challenge, with calls for removing contact precautions for patients with MRSA and VRE infection during the pandemic.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210023r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Minimizing PPE use among visitors to rooms of patients with CDI would provide much-needed additional resources for health care workers at seemingly minimal risks for worsening <italic>C difficile</italic> transmission.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has limitations. First, all data analyzed in this study were generated through simulation and not through clinical experiments. Therefore, any conclusions drawn from this study should at most be used to influence the purpose or design of such clinical experiments. Second, we did not consider the effect of community-onset CDI on hospital visitors. The model assumed that visitors could not be infected or colonized, and thus, visitors were not able to expose patients to <italic>C difficile</italic> spores from the community. This study did not consider the benefit associated with VCPs among visitors. The model also simulated each ward uniformly and did not account for differential CDI risk across wards. We also did not consider how the use or deimplementation of VCPs may affect compliance with other infection control measures, such as hand hygiene or precautions for health care worker contact. It is possible that deimplementing VCPs would suggest to visitors and health care workers a diminished risk of <italic>C difficile</italic>, which in turn may be associated with decreased compliance with other infection-control practices that are highly effective against HO-CDI. A recent study of health care workers found that the use of contact precautions was associated with increased risk-mitigating behavior, such as improved hand hygiene.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> However, another study suggests that a threshold of patients designated under isolation exists at which compliance with contact precautions decreases.<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> These studies suggest interactions between infection control interventions and their perceived importance; further work is required to understand whether such an association could be present after deimplementation of VCPs among patients with CDI. This study also did not examine the impact of VCPs in a pediatric setting, where visitor-patient interactions differ from the adult, acute care hospital setting. However, a previous agent-based model<sup><xref rid="zoi210023r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> of <italic>C difficile</italic> transmission in a pediatric hospital showed little reduction in HO-CDI in association with implementation of VCPs at an ideal level under baseline assumptions. Further research is required to estimate the contribution of VCPs in a pediatric care setting under different configurations. In addition, the assumption that visitors can only contaminate the environment, not health care workers or other patients, may be a limitation. However, given that most visitors do not physically interact with more than 1 patient, it is unlikely that changing this assumption would greatly affect the current model outcomes.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In this simulation study, VCPs were associated with minimal change in HO-CDI rates. In the context of these findings and financial and supply-chain constraints, the infection control community should reevaluate the value of VCPs for patients with CDI. If this model is correct, removing VCPs, which are associated with minimal change in HO-CDI rates, from prevention bundles may allow better allocation of resources for containment.</p>
