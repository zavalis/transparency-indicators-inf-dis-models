                <p>Modelling the spread of coronavirus globally while learning trends at global and country levels remains crucial for tackling the pandemic. We introduce a novel variational-LSTM Autoencoder model to predict the spread of coronavirus for each country across the globe. This deep Spatio-temporal model does not only rely on historical data of the virus spread but also includes factors related to urban characteristics represented in locational and demographic data (such as population density, urban population, and fertility rate), an index that represents the governmental measures and response amid toward mitigating the outbreak (includes 13 measures such as: 1) school closing, 2) workplace closing, 3) cancelling public events, 4) close public transport, 5) public information campaigns, 6) restrictions on internal movements, 7) international travel controls, 8) fiscal measures, 9) monetary measures, 10) emergency investment in health care, 11) investment in vaccines, 12) virus testing framework, and 13) contact tracing). In addition, the introduced method learns to generate a graph to adjust the spatial dependences among different countries while forecasting the spread. We trained two models for short and long-term forecasts. <italic>The first one</italic> is trained to output one step in future with three previous timestamps of all features across the globe, whereas <italic>the second model</italic> is trained to output 10 steps in future. Overall, the trained models show high validation for forecasting the spread for each country for short and long-term forecasts, which makes the introduce method a useful tool to assist decision and policymaking for the different corners of the globe.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>As a novel contagious disease, COVID-19 has reached <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">more than eight millions confirmed cases</ext-link> and more than 400,000 death globally by 14<sup>th</sup> of June 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although there are a number of the statistical and epidemic models to analyse COVID-19 outbreak, the models are suffering from many assumptions to evaluate the impact of intervention plans which create a low accuracy as well as unsure prediction [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, there is a vital need to develop new frameworks/methods to curb/control the spread of Coronavirus immediately [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246120.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p>The epidemic outbreak of COVID-19 in literature is investigated using mathematical compartmental model named Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The SIR model represents a population under three categories: 1) Susceptible (the number of people presently not infected), 2) the number of people currently infected, and 3) the number of people either recovered or died. The model describes as differential equations. The model is completely determined by transmission rate, the recovery rate, and the initial condition, which can be estimated using least square error, Kalman filtering or BMC. The model is sometimes renamed based on the new parameters such as Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) or Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR). The main idea in the version of all SIRs models are four-fold; first, identification and better understanding current epidemic [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], second, simulation the behaviour of the system [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], third, forecasting of the future behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and last, how we control the current situation [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the results of the models including accuracy only valid based on their assumptions in a slice of available data/moment and have their scopes to assist healthcare strategies for the decision-making process.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, agent-based modelling is utilised to explore and estimate the number of contagions of COVID-19, specifically for certain countries [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246120.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Also, statistical methods [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], simple time series modelling [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and logistic map [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] are utilised for similar objectives, whereas [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], focused on modelling the spread of coronavirus based on the parameters of basic SIR in a (3-dimensional) iterative maps to provide a wider picture of the globe. Petropoulos and Makridakis [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] forecasted the total global spread relying on exponential smoothing model based only on historical data. Put all together, the drawbacks of their models are not flexible to fit for each country or region due to the lack of necessary measures, government responses, and spatial factors related to each specific location.</p>
              <p>There are few examples of predictive modelling of the coronavirus spread based on machine learning approaches, whether through shallow or deep models. While it is can be explained due to the limitation of data since the early stage of the outbreak, it remains an essential tool. According to Pham and Luengo-oroz [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], machine learning approaches certainly could assist in forecasting by with improved quality for prediction. One of the few studies is presented by [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They have applied real-time short-term forecasting using the compiled data from 11<sup>th</sup> Jan to 27<sup>th</sup> Feb 2020 collected by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the 31 provinces of China. The data is trained on a deep learning model for real-time forecasting of new cases for the provinces. Their model has the flexibility to be trained at the city, provincial, or national level. Besides, the latent variable of the trained model is used to extract necessary features for each region and fed into a K-means to cluster similar features of the infected or recovered features of patients. Bearing this in mind, there is still a knowledge gap for machine learning models to predict coronavirus cases at a global as well as regional scales [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>While SIR models with their different types, in addition to the aforementioned ones, are essential, the challenges remain in forecasting different regions and countries across the globe with a single model without any assumptions or scenario-based rules, but only with the current situations, features related to countries, and measures amid to reduce the impact of the outbreak. Accordingly, in this paper, we introduce a new method of learning and encoding information related to the historical data of coronavirus per country, features of countries, spatial dependencies among the different countries, and last, the time and location-dependent measures taken by each country amid towards reducing the impact of Coronavirus. Relying on deep learning, we introduce a novel variational Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder model to forecast the spread of coronavirus per country across the globe. This single deep model aimed to provide robust assistance to policymakers to understand the future of the pandemic at both a global level and country level, for a short-term forecast and long-term one. The main advantages of the proposed method are: 1) It can structure and learns from different data sources, either that belongs to spatial adjacency, urban and population factors, or various historical related data, 2) the model is flexible to apply to different scales, in which currently, it can provide prediction at global and country scales, however, it can be also applied to city level. And last 3) the model is capable of learning global trends for countries that have either similar measures, spread patterns, or urban and population features.</p>
              <p>After the introduction, the article is structured in five sections. Section 2 introduces the method and materials used. In section 3, we show model evaluations and the experimental results at country and global levels. In section 4 we discuss our results, compare our model to any existing base models and highlights limitations. Last, in section 5 we conclude and present our recommendation for future works.</p>

                <title>2.1 Hypothesis and assumptions</title>
                <p>The model algorithms are constructed based on four assumptions that we assume the model needs to learn to predict the next day spread: First, the model needs to extract features regarding the historical data of coronavirus spread for a given country bearing in mind the historical values of the virus spread in the other countries simultaneously before it outputs a prediction for a given country. Second, before the model gives a predicted value for each country, it should consider the predicted values of all other countries instantaneously, similar to the first point. Third, the spatial relationship between different countries is multidimensional; it can vary based on geographical location, adjacency, accessibility, or even policies for banning accessibility. The model needs to deal with variations of time and location of the different inputted scenarios while sampling outcomes. Last, apart from the virus features, for each country, there are unique demographic and geographical features that show association to the spread of the virus that may show association with the virus, in which the learning process of the model needs to consider each time before it gives a predicted value.</p>
                <p>The structure of the input data is key for any model to learn. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246120.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the concept of the overall structure of the proposed graph of multi-dimensional data sets for forecasting the spread. It illustrates how different types of data can be linked and clustered for the model to learn the spread of a virus. This data can be seen as dynamic features related to both virus and the location with long temporal scales (i.e. the population data) or short ones (<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>). It shows how local and global trend for a virus can be forecasted for a given country (<italic>n</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub>), with urban features that include both spatial and demographic factors (<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>), that share a spatial weight (<italic>g</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>) with other countries in the graph, whereas government mitigated measures (<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>q</italic></sub>) are applied. Put all together, the model needs to differentiate between factors that characterise countries or regions, and those which characterise the virus spread to understand the patterns of spread at global and country levels.</p>

                <p>To meet these hypotheses and assumptions during the learning process, the architecture of the proposed model is based on the combinations of three main components: 1) LSTM, 2) Self-attention, and 3) Variational autoencoder graph.</p>

                  <title>2.2.1 LSTM cells</title>
                  <p>LSTM represents the main component of the proposed model. It has been shown it is the ability to learn long-term dependencies easier than a simple recurrent architecture [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246120.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Unlike traditional recurrent units, it has an internal recurrence or a self-loop, in which it allows the timestamps to create paths, in which the gradient of the model can flow for a long duration without facing the vanishes issues presented in a normal recurrent unit. Even for an LSTM with a fixed parameter, the integrated time scale can change based on the input sequence, simply because the constants of time are outputted by the model itself.

It is worth mentioning that the input for the LSTM cells is can be seen as a three-dimensional tensor, representing the sample size for both training and testing, the defined timestamps for the model to look back, and the timestamps of the other countries as a global feature extractor.</p>

The spatial weight since the outbreak of the model may look completely different from the initial day to the latest day. These due to different policies and measures that are taken by countries. However, due to its high uncertainty and variation. Inputting the model with a static graph or even a dynamic one based on limited data may exacerbate the learning process. Accordingly. the third vital components in our model represent the variational autoencoder (VAE) component that allows the model to generate information from a given input.

                <p>The first branch is a self-attention LSTM model that feeds by Spatio-temporal data of coronavirus spread per day and per country, the government policies per day and per country, and the urban features per country, in which the vector is repeated to cover the duration of training (The urban features used are three features: population density, urban population percentage and fertility rate, which will be covered in detail in the upcoming section). Each input is reshaped as a 3D tensor of shape (samples, timestamps, number of features X number of countries). The three-input data are concatenated at the last axis of the data (the dimension of the feature) and passed to the first branch of the model through two parts: 1) the self-attention LSTM sequence encoder, and 2) the LSTM sequence decoder.</p>
                <p>The first sequence encodes the input data and extracts features for the second part of the LSTM sequence to output the prediction of the spread for the next day (in case of the short-term forecast) per country.</p>
                <p>The first part consists of three LSTM layers, each consists of 50 LSTM units. The first two layers activated by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and a separated by a Dropout layer of size (0.2) to minimise over-fitness Moreover, a self-attention mechanism is applied after the second LSTM layer. The final LSTM unit is activated by a linear function as the first output for the LSTM sequence encoder part.</p>
                <p>In parallel to the self-attention encoder sequence, the second branch of the model is an encoder of VAE. It is feed by a spatial matrix of dimensions (number of countries X number of countries) and repeated for the entire duration of training and timestamps (In the next section, more details will follow on how it is selected and computed). This encoder part is mainly a convolution structure, which consists of three 1D convolution layers of filters 32, 64, and 128 respectively, in which they are all of a kernel size of 1 and activated by a ReLU function and followed by a Dropout layer of size 0.2. After the dropout, two LSTM layers are followed, in which they contain 100, 494 LSTM cells respectively. The first one is activated by a ReLU function, whereas the second one by a linear function. A fully connected layer of neurons equivalent to the number of countries is applied. Last the latent space is defined with a dimension of 10, in which the z-values are generated from sampling over the Gaussian distribution of the previous inputted layer (As explained in section 2.2.3). To visualise the generated graph for representation purposes, It is worth mentioning that the encoder of the second branch of the model can be decoded to output the generated samples for each predicted sequence by passing it into a decoder VAE, where the 1D convolutions layers are transposed to a final output shape equal to the inputted dimension. As for future work, this could be an interesting approach to understanding the variation of the graph for each predicted day for all countries.</p>
                <p>Both outputs of the self-attention LSTM encoder and the encoder of the VAE are concatenated over the feature dimension and passed to the LSTM decoder sequence, which contains a single LSTM layer of cell numbers equal to the total number of countries. It is followed by two fully connected layers of shape size (1 X number of countries) for predicting the value of the next day, in case of the short-term forecast, or can be shaped to (numbers of future steps X number of countries) for any number of future steps that model needs to output per each country.</p>
                <p>Data sets are split to training and testing on the first dimension of data shape (the total duration of the temporal data), in a way that the model can be tested on the last 6 days. We trained two different models, one as a single-step model for the short-term forecast (one day), whereas the other is trained as a multi-step model (10 days forecast). There are two crucial differences between these two models; The output layer, and the dimension of the y-train, and y-test of the first one is shaped as (1 x n), whereas in the other model is output layer is shaped as (10 X n), despite the number of samples. is the structure of the y-train and y-test. The second issue is the trained and tested sample is not only reduced by the number of timestamps–at the beginning of each sequence- as in the case of the first model but also reduced by the number of future steps -at the end of the sequence- in the case of the second model. Last, based on trial and error, we structured the data based on 3 timestamps for both models to look back for all the input features for each country, in which we found optimal results.</p>
                <p>The weights of the model are initialised by random weights. The model is compiled based on the backpropagation of error of the stochastic gradient descents, relying on ‘adam’ optimiser [<xref rid="pone.0246120.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], with a learning rate of 0.001 and momentum 0.9.

The two reasons for selecting these features are: First, the selection is based on enhancing the model prediction after several trial and errors with and without several features. Second and most importantly, the selected features show a statistically significant association with the spread of coronavirus over time for all countries across the globe. We examined other variables that represent each country or region such as the absolute value of population in 2020, the yearly change in the population, the world share of the population, and the value of the land area for a given country, in which we found them insignificant with the spread of coronavirus over time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246120.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows the outputs of the spearman correlation for the three selected factors. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246120.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, the population density was significant with decaying positive correlation coefficients (rho) for the first 70 days from the starting date. This means at the early stage of the virus spread, the higher the population density, the more likely a higher coronavirus spread. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246120.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, the fertility rates across the globe show a significant association over the entire test duration except for May. The significant results are with negative rho values, which means countries with higher fertility rates are less likely to have a higher spread of coronavirus, except for the spread of the virus in May. This could explain the less spread of the virus in Africa (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246120.g003">Fig 3</xref>), however, this feature may be a time-dependant or due to reporting inaccuracy or the low percentage of virus testing in Africa. Last, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246120.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, the percentage of the urban population started to show a significant association with the spread of the virus with positive rho values only for the period between the end of February till the first week of May. During this period, this means the higher the countries with a higher percentage of the urban population, are more likely to have higher coronavirus spread.</p>

Given, this spatial weight may vary or have a higher degree of uncertainty, the model only self-learns from its representation while it generates various samples with the VAE encoder as discussed earlier, instead of using these data as a fixed and constant factor during training and testing. to be in business-as-usual.

                <p>After 500 epochs, the training and testing curves of the model show a steady output with no sign of over fitness, nevertheless, the MSE losses for both curves are at a minimum, with values less than 0.01, whereas the KL loss for the test set is less than 0.37 for both trained model. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246120.g009">Fig 9</xref>, we show the distribution of the confirmed and predicted cases globally with the single-step model. The total predicted cases per day is a close number to the actual data, with a slightly higher confirmed in Africa than what has been confirmed.</p>

The results are highly accurate at a global level, with a fraction difference between the actual and predicted ones on the last examined day 14/06/2020. Specifically, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246120.g010">Fig 10A</xref> show the accumulated prediction and the actual cases globally in a linear scale of cases counts. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246120.g010">Fig 10B</xref> shows the true and predicted of confirmed cases at a logarithmic scale. It compares the logarithmic prediction and true values. After the initial days- where the initial cases were mainly zero in many countries globally and there was no enough data for the model to learn- the model shows a high validation in learning the overall pattern, in addition to predicting the actual numbers.</p>

                <p>The prediction of the model is nonlinear, however, its output at a given sample when compared to its ground truth is linear. Therefore, fitting a linear regression model between the predicted result and the observed one and providing an r-squared value could be a good indicator for understanding the model strength. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246120.g010">Fig 10C</xref> shows the relation between the confirmed and predicted cases after fitting it to a linear model. It also shows the r-squared value, the root of the MSE metrics (RMSE) and the MSLE for a linear regression fitted model on the predicted and actual values of our single-step model. The computed metrics show a high linear association among them.</p>
                <p>What makes this method more reliable than any simple time-series model is that the predicted global curve to the actual one is outputted without the model learning any explicit rules extracted at the global level to mimic the global spread curve of the virus. The model learns the patterns at country levels, whereas error is minimised at both local and global levels. What makes this a very crucial point to discuss is that changes across the globe are more likely to happen at a country level, whereas the global level is rather an impact of the different countries.</p>
                <p><xref rid="pone.0246120.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> compares the result of the introduced method with and without the adjacency matrix and the variational component of the model. It shows that the introduced method with the variational autoencoder component and the introduced adjacency matrix enhances the prediction by reducing the model loss at a global scale with an RMSE value of 174.3 and MSLE value of 0.472. These results show the significant impact of the introduced method in understanding adjacency between different countries.</p>

After having enough data and after passing the initial days with zero values (the first 40–50 days), the model shows high performance in learning the spread pattern. It is worth mentioning that the distortion in ground truth curves reflects data uncertainty, which accordingly, it impacts the variance of the predicted values. Overall, the model shows higher performance in countries with higher spread whereas the performance of the model decreases with countries with fewer cases over a short period. However, the model shows overall reliable results at a country level for estimating the actual results and their overall patterns.</p>

This model is evaluated per country and step. While the model performance reduces with the increase of the number of steps, compared to the single-step model, the result to a higher degree remains consistent at a country level when we reach the 10-step.</p>

              <title>5. Discussion</title>
              <p>In this article, we introduce a method for predicting the spread of coronavirus for each country across the globe for both short and long-term forecast. It has three main advantages, first, the model learns not only from the historical data but also the applied governmental measures for each country, urban factors, and the spatial graph that represent the dependencies among the different countries. The second advantage of the model is its ability to be applied at various scales. Currently, it can forecast the spread at a global and country, and region level (i.e. the case of China, UK), however, it can also be applied at the city level. Last, the model can forecast short and long term forecast which could be a reliable tool for decision-making.</p>

                <title>5.1 Base model evaluations</title>
                <p>There are different attempts for relying on a simple time-series model whether it is relying on machine learning or a simple mathematical rule for a single country or the total cases globally. However, the drawback in such methods is: First, by fitting an exponential smoothing function to a model with no controlled point would mean the virus will continue to spread, regardless of the number of a population, the action is taken. Second, if a simple rule for a given country works for the last days, till when this logic will continue works? What happens when values remain constant, decrease, or even increase at a different rate? There are different possible scenarios that such an approach could not answer. Third, despite the first two arguments, how many rules are needed to fit each country globally at a longer period? Subjectively, a simple time-series model without considering the factors that characterise countries or policies taken to find “general rules and features” would mean finding simple rules for each country at a given time. In most simple ways, when the curve is only increasing at the initial spread time.</p>
                <p>Last, even if these previous issues are solved, the world is connected, the spatial weights may vary from country to country or day to day based on the restrictions and measures are taken. If there are simple rules that ultimately can fit the entire countries, the challenges would remain in how to weight the changes around the world. Most importantly, one single case in one region could influence the spread elsewhere.</p>

                <title>5.2 Deployment and online inference</title>
                <p>The model is trained on data from different countries, with different measures applied at a different pace. It has also seen data before, during and after lockdown measures of different regions. Moreover, the model has seen data before and after travel restrictions (from January to June) for certain countries. Accordingly, even if measures and restrictions change in the future, this could allow the model to predict future cases by understanding and inferring the change in the measures and their effects in a given country. However, as for the future improvement of the model, more data types, when they are available, could be fed into the model. Besides the policies and restriction that would vary from country to country, real-time mobility data or mobility indices could help the model to forecast new cases in the post-lockdown periods.</p>
                <p>Building on how the model could be used for future inference, deploying the model in an online platform is a possible application of this research. This application could assist policy-makers to have a better overview picture of the status of the spread of the virus across the globe to help implement or eliminate a given policy. In <xref rid="pone.0246120.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, we show the run-time required for the different tasks on a single GPU. We show that updating the data, computing adjacency, fusing the data, and re-training the model would require less 5 min, whereas utilising the model for inference will require less a second to predict a future step (multi-steps) for all countries.</p>

                <title>5.3 Limitations and future work</title>
                <p>The generative graph of the model along with the other factors has generated good predictions for each country globally (based on trial and errors). However, it remains a challenge that countries with spread over a longer period are more likely to be predicted more accurately than countries with no prior cases, despite how large or small the numbers of cases are. Based on our experiments, the model still understands the pattern in countries that are perceived as outliers, but with lower accuracy. For example in case of Sri Lanka, the strength of the model performance, in term of r-squared, decreases by 23% or the logarithmic error increases by 2.5 folds in comparison to the model performance in predicting spread cases in the United States (see <xref rid="pone.0246120.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Re-training the model with more data in the future would yield better results at both global and country levels. Besides data improvement, there are three main ways in which the model algorithms can be advanced in future work. First, finding more significant spatial or demographic factors that show significant associations with the spread may enhance the forecasts of the model. Second, applying the same concept and goals of the model to other subjects of coronavirus could lead to a better understanding of its future. This may include estimating deaths or recovery, bearing in mind the health system capability and capacity, in addition to the governmental responses. Currently, the model is capable of forecasting 10 steps in the future with acceptable accuracy, in which it is validated. With more data on more factors, the introduced method could also lead to better long-term forecast for each country based on the lesson learned from the global and country-level trends.</p>
                <p>Last, the method introduced can be used for polices evaluation by changing a given policy for a given country and date to show how the prediction in future is affected. Accordingly, as for future research, exploring the effect of the different urban factors and governmental measures at both global and country levels can be tackled to assist policy-makers to reach optimal measures amid toward reducing the spread of coronavirus. for reaching optimal measures.</p>

              <title>6. Remarks and lessons learned</title>
              <p>In this article, we introduced a novel variational-LSTM autoencoder to predict the spread of coronavirus for different regions/countries across the globe. The introduced learning process and the structure of the data are keys. The model learned from various types of dynamic and static data, including the historical spread data for each country, urban and demographic features such as urban population, population density, and fertility rate, and government responses for each country amid towards mitigating coronavirus outbreak. Also, the model learned to sample different conditions and adjustments of a spatially weighted adjacency matrix among the different infected countries. Overall, the model shows high validation for forecasting the spread at global and country levels, which makes it a useful tool to assist decision and policymaking for the different corners of the globe.</p>
              <p>There are several lessons learned while conducting this research. First, concerning urban features, we found several associations of several factors with the spread of coronavirus globally for a specific period of the tested duration. Most significantly, countries with a higher density of population in one km<sup>2</sup> and larger portion of the population living in urban areas are associated with higher coronavirus spread with different coefficients, and levels of statistical significance during the examined duration, whereas countries with higher fertility rates are associated with fewer spread cases at the given studied period (22/01/2020-14/06/2020). However, we also found an association with other factors that not used in this research such as migration nets. We found that countries with higher migration flows are associated with higher spread which could also be explained with their likelihood of having a higher influx of job opportunities. Second, concerning the computed adjacency matrix graph, we found that at very short distances among the different infected countries with coronavirus spread, Western European countries (such as Germany, Italy, Spain) are fully or partially connected relative to other countries globally that are same distance they are completely isolated. This can be reflected on the relatively shorter distance–as a physical attribute-as among these countries when it compares to other countries, or the non-physical accessibility of the European market which could lead to a higher influx of migration and accordingly higher spread cases.</p>

              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Ibrahim,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>The paper shows a model that is interesting (see comment of reviewer 1). However, the manuscript makes extravagant claims. It also misleads by using linear scale whose results in the most part appear as being close with the real data while in reality are far in a log scale (see comments of reviewer 2). I recommend to rather apply log scales and to claim more realistic discourse closer to the data, emphasizing the limits of the model</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jul 30 2020 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>

              <p>The paper shows a model that is interesting (see comment of reviewer 1). However, the manuscript makes extravagant claims. It also misleads by using linear scale whose results in the most part appear as being close with the real data while in reality are far in a log scale (see comments of reviewer 2). I recommend to better apply log scales and to claim more realistic comments closer to the data, emphasizing the limits of the model</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The study reports a model that predicts trends of spread of coronavirus at a country level which will be of immense utility value for policymakers and public health planners.</p>
              <p>An added utility is that it is based on machine learning and will complement other mathematical and statistical models.</p>
              <p>The novelty of the model is that it includes historical data, location, demographic data, and more importantly government measures to mitigate the epidemic (e.g. cancelled public events, travel restrictions, closing of work-places, closure of international travel etc.) and spatial dependence of states to each other. This improves the validity of the model to higher levels of precision. The use of country-specific data has enhanced its relevance and applicability to policymakers at a country level. Its flexibility and ability to refine to the city level is a distinct advantage, because the epidemic often begins in localities and spreads within cities.</p>
              <p>The paper is well written and easy to understand. The tables and figures are excellent. The references are up-to-date.</p>
              <p>Two points could be explored. How would the model respond to further data on the effectiveness of measures (e.g. travel restrictions as a measure vs. real-time mobility data as an outcome of the measure)? How well would the model fit with countries that are outliers (e.g. Sri Lanka has had less than 1350 cases as of 26th May and 10 deaths. This includes 650+ cases detected within a navy camp and about 300 in Sri Lankan returnees who were working overseas, especially from the Middle East. This demonstrating that their strict policy of curfews coupled with detect, trace contacts, quarantine has essentially limited the spread to clusters with almost zero community spread (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://epid.gov.lk/web/">https://epid.gov.lk/web/</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript discusses the application of a Long-Short Term Memory autoencoder in the data of Covid-19 with the goal of producing a short (next day) and a longer (10-day) term forecast.</p>
              <p>Indeed, the model makes a prediction of the outcome of the coronavirus cases in several countries. However, and given the results shown by the authors themselves, it does not seem to produce the desirable effect and most of the projections seem to be far from acceptable.</p>
              <p>My overall comments are the following:</p>
              <p>The results are projected in linear figures, while it is obvious that the logarithmic scale is the one which is of interest. Where the results to be transformed in a logarithmic scale (which is of interest for projecting the cases in the next few days) the results from the authors would in many countries show differences from real data. For example, the prediction for Italy would show, in a logarithmic figure that the cases would flatten out soon, while the real data (and the ensuing history which is now known) would have shown the opposite. Countries like Russia, France, the UK and more from the ones mentioned in here, have the same (I would say almost systematic) type of behavior. That is, the model shows almost all of them with a significantly lower estimate of expected cases. Though the actual difference is small, the trend is significantly different. And the trend is more important than the actual number as it is what allows (or enforces) additional measures to be lifted (or taken).</p>
              <p>Additionally, the manuscript makes extravagant claims such as the possibility for a 1-3 month prediction by using this method. I feel that the forecasts made in the manuscript are not as good to support such a claim.</p>
              <p>On a separate issue, I feel that the reality has taught us that only the initial few cases of a specific country depend on how other countries are going. Upon quarantine measures are taken into effect the evolution of cases in any country depends on the strictness and enforcement of the measures taken. Countries like South Korea and the USA have had (and still have) a totally different history and under no circumstances does the case of one affect the other.</p>
              <p>Overall, I feel that the manuscript makes extravagant and largely unsupported by the results and reality claims. It also misleads by using linear scale whose results in the most part appear as being close with the real data while in reality are far in a log scale.</p>
              <p>As such, I cannot recommend publication of this manuscript.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Editor and reviewers, </p>
              <p>Thanks for your comments and feedback. We have modified several aspects in the article:</p>
              <p>1- We have updated the data to June, to make the article up-to-date.</p>
              <p>2- We have applied a logarithmic scale for the outputted data alongside the actual scale (linear scale). We believe that both have very different applications. Understanding the pattern is one thing while giving the ability to predict actual values is also vital for many applications. </p>
              <p>On a side note, a logarithmic function tends to smooth out any given function, by reducing the data dimensionality and removing outliners. This makes it simpler to forecast than the actual number, unlike what reviewer 2 mentioned (In fact, a log output would tend to show a better performance of our model than the actual data). Please, see the added figures. The log functions tend to widen the difference of the earlier points of low values, whereas close the different at the end of the curve. This shows how the model learns the pattern of the data after the initial zero cases of most countries (after having enough cases to extract patterns).</p>
              <p>3- Besides our evaluation metrics, we have added also a Mean squared logarithmic error (MSLE) to compare the results of different countries. It is a relative error, which could be a good indicator for comparing the performance of the model in different countries despite how large or small the values of the cases in a country. </p>
              <p>4- We have added two new discussion points: to discuss outliners, and the online inference of the model and its flexibility to different data sources as suggested by reviewers 1</p>
              <p>All figures including maps are within our copyrights, we did not use google maps or any copyrighted software to visualise them. We created them using open-access python libraries- Basemap and Matplotlib. </p>
              <p>Please, see a detailed response to each comment below.</p>

Understanding the pattern is one thing while giving the ability to predict actual values is also vital for many other applications that require a short-term forecast of accurate estimation per day.</p>
              <p>We also discussed more points to emphasise the limits of the model in the discussion section.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: </p>
              <p>The study reports a model that predicts trends of the spread of coronavirus at a country level which will be of immense utility value for policymakers and public health planners.</p>

              <p>Two points could be explored. How would the model respond to further data on the effectiveness of measures (e.g. travel restrictions as a measure vs. real-time mobility data as an outcome of the measure)? </p>
              <p>This is an interesting and valid point for discussion. The model is trained on data from different countries, with different measures applied at a different pace. It has also seen data before, during and after lockdown measures of different regions. Moreover, the model has seen data before travel restriction and after travel restriction (from January to June) for certain countries. Accordingly, even if measures and restrictions change in future, this could allow the model to predict future cases by understanding and inferring the change in the measures and their effects in a given country. However, as for the future improvement of the model, more data types -when they are available- could be feed for the model. Besides the policies and restriction that would vary from country to country, real-time mobility data or mobility indices could help the model to forecast new cases in the post-lockdown periods. </p>
              <p>Building on how the model could be used for future inference, deploying the model in an online platform is a possible application of this research. This application could assist policy-makers to have a better overview picture of the status of the spread of the virus across the globe, nevertheless, implement or eliminate a given policy. In table 3, we show the run-time required for the different tasks on a single GPU. We show that updating the data, computing adjacency, fusing the data, and re-training the model would require less 5 min, whereas utilising the model in the inference model will require less a second to predict a future step (multi-steps) for all countries. </p>
              <p>We have added a discussion point in the discussion section, addressing how the model can be used for online inference in a data stream. </p>
              <p>How well would the model fit with countries that are outliers (e.g. Sri Lanka has had less than 1350 cases as of 26th May and 10 deaths. This includes 650+ cases detected within a navy camp and about 300 in Sri Lankan returnees who were working overseas, especially from the Middle East. This demonstrating that their strict policy of curfews coupled with detect, trace contacts, quarantine have essentially limited the spread to clusters with almost zero community spread (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://epid.gov.lk/web/">https://epid.gov.lk/web/</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>This seems to be an interesting case. We have discussed the limitation of the model to outliers, in the discussion section. We also added the case of Sri Lanka in the results of the single-step and multi-step models to show the performance of the model and how the model performs in countries with fewer cases.</p>
              <p>Overall, the model would perform less accurately in countries with fewer data points for a given country (countries with a spread that started at a very late stage). However, the model would not be affected by how high or low the values per day as long as there are enough data points for a country to learn its pattern. </p>
              <p>Based on our experiments, the model still understands the pattern in countries that are perceived as outliers, but with lower accuracy. For example in case of Sri Lanka, the strength of the model performance, in term of r-squared, decreases by 23% percent or the logarithmic error increases by 2.5 folds in comparison to the model performance in predicting spread cases in the United States (See table 1). We further discussed this issue in 5.3 Limitation and future work</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: </p>
              <p>The results are projected in linear figures, while it is obvious that the logarithmic scale is the one which is of interest. Where the results to be transformed in a logarithmic scale (which is of interest for projecting the cases in the next few days) the results from the authors would in many countries show differences from real data. For example, the prediction for Italy would show, in a logarithmic figure that the cases would flatten out soon, while the real data (and the ensuing history which is now known) would have shown the opposite. Countries like Russia, France, the UK and more from the ones mentioned in here, have the same (I would say almost systematic) type of behavior. That is, the model shows almost all of them with a significantly lower estimate of expected cases. Though the actual difference is small, the trend is significantly different. And the trend is more important than the actual number as it is what allows (or enforces) additional measures to be lifted (or taken).</p>
              <p>Given that understanding the pattern is important as well as the true values, we have plotted the results in true figures and logarithmic scale. It is up to the readers- or policy-makers -to apply the model in whichever form that suit the application. </p>
              <p>Concerning the trend more important than the actual numbers: Understanding the trend is one application of a predictive model and could be important for drawing policies or remove certain regulation, which we have provided in the new figures for each country which the model shows a good understanding of the pattern. Since that log function tends to reduce the dimensionality of data, many countries will follow the same trend, even if they have an extremely different count of cases. This also can be seen as misleading information. For instance, if you trying to estimate how many bed or ventilations in the hospitals that are needed in the next days, then the actual number per day is more vital than the pattern. Even if the log scale is transformable to a normal scale, the small loss at a log scale- if the model is trained in it- would lead to a large loss in normal scale. Nevertheless, the latter (Estimating numbers in normal scale) is missing in the literature as most of the model would rather project a pattern, than provide a predictive model that able to predict day by day.</p>
              <p>Additionally, the manuscript makes extravagant claims such as the possibility for a 1-3 month prediction by using this method. I feel that the forecasts made in the manuscript are not as good to support such a claim.</p>
              <p>We mentioned in the early manuscript in future work section: “Put all together, more data, more factors, different forecasting models could also lead to better long-term forecast (1-3 months) for each country based on the lesson learned from the global and country-level trends of spread.”</p>
              <p>We have re-stated our statements to make sure that the scope and the limitation are clear, and how this could be reached in the future using our model. </p>
              <p>Concerning the statement: “I feel the forecasts made in the manuscript are not as good”, we have provided several empirical methods to quantify the losses and the accuracies of our model, in the addition to the descriptive analysis of the plotted figures and maps which shows with more data in the future- similar to any machine learning models- the model would be capable of forecasting the long term pattern if fed with more data on the upcoming months, which supports our statement of the long-term forecasts.</p>
              <p>On a separate issue, I feel that the reality has taught us that only the initial few cases of a specific country depend on how other countries are going. </p>
              <p>We are not sure if we fully understood this statement. Initial cases could be a good indicator of how a given country can lead to- for understanding other countries. However, what happens when a country that has similar initial cases to another country, took different measures? We don’t think initial cases is enough to predict the complexity of reality as we mention in the articles each country has unique factors, measures, spread patterns, and adjacency link to other countries. Only, the combinations of this, or even more factors, could lead to better prediction. </p>
              <p>We have clarified that in the new submission. </p>
              <p>Upon quarantine measures are taken into effect the evolution of cases in any country depends on the strictness and enforcement of the measures taken. </p>
              <p>We agree that strictness of the measure during the quarantine time could be an indicator however, it is never be quantified or supported by empirical methods. Nevertheless, there are other factors, even with strict enforcement that could lead to the evolution of cases in a given country. For instance, the effect of going to grocery stores is not yet measured, whereas it takes place in every country despite the enforcement of the quarantine measures and could lead to exposures. Second, the number of testing per day -despite how strict the enforcement of measures could lead to adding more numbers of cases in a given country, despite how strict the measure is. Third, people moving by car or bus to adjust countries, which we think it is the case in the EU countries, despite how strict the measures countries are taking. </p>
              <p>Based on our empirical findings, understanding adjacency of countries has improved the prediction of the model – in comparison to without the adjacency of countries- and we have mentioned that in our method.</p>
              <p>Countries like South Korea and the USA have had (and still have) a totally different history and under no circumstances does the case of one affect the other.</p>
              <p>We agree that countries have different patterns due to their demographics features, urban features, spread historical data, and applied policies and measures. We never mentioned anything regarding South Korea and the USA having a similar history. However, one case elsewhere is enough to cause spread in another country by mobility despite the different nature of each county –the reality has taught us that. Understanding the adjacency between countries means including factors due to mobility that is not necessarily based on travel by flights. It could, for instance, travel by car (which could be the case across Europe, or across the US states), even during the US taking an international strict measures, but moving around the country or adjacent countries was not yet limited. Even if cases are few, they remain as important risk factors that could be neglected.</p>

              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Ibrahim,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>==============================</p>
              <p>Thanks for having improved the explanations and output of the model. It remains some minor remarks from the 2 reviewers.</p>
              <p>Reviewer 1: asks to mention other possible variables (maybe at the end of the paper in conclusion to explain why the model fitted lower with some cases and give future possible improvements)</p>
              <p>Reveiwer 2: be more modest on the result and improve the Log graphs by putting "real values": Also I would add that log graphs must have the background of lines with uneven distances, which shows  obviously at the first glance that it is log (do you see what I mean? If it is not clear I can send you an example of these kinds of graphs by email: please contact me directly)</p>
              <p>Please see below the details of the feed-back of the 2 reviewers. I hope that you will be able to address these last remarks quickly</p>

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors have responded to the point raised by the reviewers. The paper clearly states the aims, the methods used, the results obtained and discusses the results while indicating the drawbacks of the study. As regards to urban features, the authors mention the presence of "...a wide range of factors, however, we only selected three factors; 1) Population density, 2) fertility rate and 3) urban population". It would be good to mention some of the other urban features that were ignored due to lack of a correlation etc.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: I believe that the authors have taken into account my comments and suggestions, albeit, not all of them exactly as they were intended.</p>
              <p>Specifically, my point was to have the presentation of the results in a log-normal fashion. The trend up to then would have been misleading to a reader in some cases (e.g. Russia, France, Romania, and Italy with the previous data). Thus, I had only expected the authors to show log-normalized versions of their linear analysis results. The log normal representation would emphasize on the points where there is a change in the trend. E.g. in countries where you were far from the logarithmic "plateau" (Russia) you could foresee that the situation was not coming under control anytime soon in a log normal representation, while in your forecasts this was not obvious. A log normal representation of your RMSE results would have shown that you were unjustly predicting a "plateau". Also, in general, the trend changes in the beginning of all actual country cases real data could not be seen in linear scales, while in log normal trend changes were clearly shown.</p>
              <p>The log-normal analysis with the new MSLE presented in the revised version, gets results that seem much more confident in the end of their set. However, the results show very bad confidence in the beginning. By using more recent data, most countries now exhibit smaller changes in the curvature of their cases lines, especially given the much bigger training set usable for the method. Additionally, indeed, as the authors point out the logarithmic value of a number suppresses the dimensionality of the results. The effort to "flatten the curve" though by many countries wanting to control Covid-19, was meant for the log-normal cases lines (same amount of new cases per day) and not for the linear ones (which would mean no cases at all per day).</p>
              <p>I feel that the method presented is not very accurate in following abrupt changes in the curvature of a cases line (my point to begin with). This comment can be made even for the linear analysis (RMSE), where changes are followed always with a delay by the forecast. This, in my opinion, reduces the strength of the analysis greatly. It essentially translates to an inability to forecast reliably in any point in time, other than that where only linear or almost linear changes occur. Forecasting only the linear part of a line, or very smoothly changing lines, is not a major achievement and this part of the manuscripts' analysis is not very appealing in my opinion.</p>
              <p>Despite this, and given that a comment is included that the method fails to predict abrupt changes (even more for small datasets), the analysis can indeed present valid results for all other cases, and the technical standards used are high enough for it to warrant publication in PLOS. It is simply not ground breaking research in my opinion.</p>
              <p>My only other suggestion now is that the log normal figures of the manuscript should be presented in their y-axis as is standardized in such cases (1,10,100,1000, 10K, 100K, etc), and not in their logarithmic results (now used 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectfully).</p>
              <p>I urge the authors to check what has been done for example for Covid-19 in the worldometers website. They can perhaps even see how different the log-normal (mentioned as logarithmic in there) results are than the linear ones (especially early on for each country), and how the log-normal representation pointed to moments where trends changed significantly.</p>

              <p>Dear Editor and reviewers, </p>
              <p>Thanks for your comments and feedback. We have addressed the two comments raised by the reviewers. </p>
              <p>Reviewer 1: asks to mention other possible variables (maybe at the end of the paper in conclusion to explain why the model fitted lower with some cases and give future possible improvements)</p>
              <p>We have added discussed the variables that we found insignificant in section 3.1.2 Urban features data.</p>
              <p>Reviewer 2: be more modest on the result and improve the Log graphs by putting "real values": Also I would add that log graphs must have the background of lines with uneven distances, which shows obviously at the first glance that it is log (do you see what I mean? If it is not clear I can send you an example of these kinds of graphs by email: please contact me directly)</p>
              <p>We have modified the interpretation of the result to be more modest by removing unnecessary words. We have changed all the logarithmic graphs to be with an unevenly distributed y-axis.</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>
              <p>The authors.</p>

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: I believe that all of my previous comments have been addressed and thus I feel that the manuscript can be published in the journal.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The paper presents a model to predict coronavirus spread based on machine learning and it could be another important tool in the hands of policymakers to better attempt to control the epidemic spread.</p>
              <p>The model uses historical data, location, demographic data to feed the model and more importantly it uses government measures to control the epidemic and interdependency of the countries/cities to address the influence of each in the state of the epidemic of the others.</p>
              <p>The paper is well written and is easy to understand and to the best of my knowledge is a good contribution to the COVID research landscape.</p>
              <p>However I think some points should be more highly discussed.</p>
              <p>The authors claim that the use of demographic data is one of the advantages of the proposed method. In section 3.1.2 the authors present the factors from the demographic data they included in the model and how it is correlated with the covid cases spread over time, but afterwards no result is presented confirming the impact of these factors in the prediction. I have the intuition that some if not all of these factors of demographic data are somehow present in the COVID-19 confirmed cases data.</p>
              <p>Following the same line of thinking, the interaction between countries, that I think is one of the most important considerations of the paper, does not explore its impact on the results of the model. I think some comparative results may be included considering different adjacency matrices, like the ones presented in section 3.1.4, and the absence of it.</p>
              <p>Also regarding interaction between countries and adjacency matrices, in some early papers of COVID-19, for instance the ones presented by Vittoria Colizza on risk of importation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30411-6/fulltext">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30411-6/fulltext</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003193">https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003193</ext-link>) is used the data of air travel as a proxy of the interaction. Why is this not considered in this model?</p>
              <p>Another important advantage of the model is the inclusion of governmental mitigation measures. In the paper (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30785-4/fulltext?fbclid=IwAR3tcQgOb7CUa3bAxgOL7bsqRPj5jJn-UZI4KcpzTBfIEgt98YWucuZU2Zg">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30785-4/fulltext?fbclid=IwAR3tcQgOb7CUa3bAxgOL7bsqRPj5jJn-UZI4KcpzTBfIEgt98YWucuZU2Zg</ext-link>) it is shown that most measures have an impact on the reproduction number, and therefore in the cases after 7-14 days. Considering that the predictions of the model are somehow validated to be good till 10 days in advance there is any result that supports that the prediction is being influenced by the measures?. Could it quantify the change in the behavior of the prediction after a governmental measure is taken?.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear editor and reviewers,</p>
              <p>We would like to thank you for your time and effort to review this article for the third round. </p>
              <p>We added a new table (Table 1) to explore the impact of the adjacency matrices and variational autoencoder components on the global results of the model as suggested by Reviewer 3. </p>
              <p>Reviewer 3 has suggested different discussion points with reference to several articles that have been published in July or even last month (October), whereas this presented article was submitted to the journal in April. Given the length of time our article has been under review and the unprecedented pace of progress in this field, we believe it is unfair to require us to substantially modify the paper to account for new literature at the third review round.</p>
              <p>The article has been through three different minor revisions since the first submission and all the raised comments were minor comments from different reviewers that focus on addressing viewpoints and discussion. While we believe all of the raised comments are valuable and valid discussion points, they do not contribute to the advancement of the introduced method which is our main contribution in this article. </p>
              <p>Please find our detailed responses and, where we feel it is necessary, rebuttals for the raised discussion points below. We would appreciate it if the journal makes a final decision concerning the presented article. </p>
              <p>Regards,</p>
              <p>Authors</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The paper presents a model to predict coronavirus spread based on machine learning and it could be another important tool in the hands of policymakers to better attempt to control the epidemic spread.</p>
              <p>The model uses historical data, location, demographic data to feed the model and more importantly it uses government measures to control the epidemic and interdependency of the countries/cities to address the influence of each in the state of the epidemic of the others.</p>
              <p>The paper is well written and is easy to understand and to the best of my knowledge is a good contribution to the COVID research landscape.</p>
              <p>However, I think some points should be more highly discussed.</p>
              <p>The authors claim that the use of demographic data is one of the advantages of the proposed method. In section 3.1.2 the authors present the factors from the demographic data they included in the model and how it is correlated with the covid cases spread over time, but afterwards no result is presented confirming the impact of these factors in the prediction. I have the intuition that some if not all of these factors of demographic data are somehow present in the COVID-19 confirmed cases data.</p>
              <p>It has been mentioned in the article (Section 3.1.2) that there are two main reasons for selecting these factors: 1) their correlation with the spread, and 2) their enhancement of the model outcomes based on trial and error. The impact of the factors has been seen during the creation of the model and how the model becomes more reliable. In other words, these factors provide a unique set of features for the different countries that the model self-learn from it through the introduced algorithm. This also has been mentioned in Model Hypothesis, see section 2.1 Hypothesis and assumptions.</p>
              <p>Following the same line of thinking, the interaction between countries, that I think is one of the most important considerations of the paper, does not explore its impact on the results of the model. I think some comparative results may be included considering different adjacency matrices, like the ones presented in section 3.1.4, and the absence of it.</p>
              <p>We have added a new table to compare the results with and without the introduced adjacency matrix at a global scale. The results of the introduced method with the variational autoencoder component and the introduced adjacency matrix reduces the losses of the same model without these components with an RMSE loss value of 174.3 (See table 1). Also, for further analysis, the below figure shows the outcomes of the model without adjacency similar to the one introduced in the article with adjacency matrix and VAE (Figure 9). It also confirms how the results improved by applying the adjacency matrix. </p>
              <p>Also regarding interaction between countries and adjacency matrices, in some early papers of COVID-19, for instance, the ones presented by Vittoria Colizza on the risk of importation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30411-6/fulltext">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30411-6/fulltext</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003193">https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003193</ext-link>) is used the data of air travel as a proxy of the interaction. Why is this not considered in this model?</p>
              <p>At the time of writing the article, it was not possible to obtain open access flight data at the global level in a timely fashion. Moreover, there are many more transportation modes that may be used for international travel at the continental level that would not be captured in the flight data. Attempting to collect this data on the global scale would sacrifice the timeliness of our research in a rapidly evolving situation. Therefore, we developed our method to infer mobility from the data. The purpose of using a variational autoencoder in this model along with the adjacency matrix (as explained in the paper) is to generate different weights between the countries that represent the mobility flow, not only air travel but all types of mobility. The data taught us that even when there were air travel restrictions, cases remain increasing in certain countries, for instance, among Western European countries, given that distances are shorter and people can travel with cars and coaches. Cargo flights were still active, etc. Accordingly, using air travel alone as a proxy could be a limitation as well as an advantage.</p>
              <p>It worth mentioning that this article has been submitted to the journal in April, whereas the second article you refer to was published on July 17, 2020. Given the rapid pace of developments in this field, we feel it is a little unfair to be asked to consider new literature at the third round of review that were not mentioned in previous rounds. </p>
              <p>Another important advantage of the model is the inclusion of governmental mitigation measures. In the paper (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30785-4/fulltext?fbclid=IwAR3tcQgOb7CUa3bAxgOL7bsqRPj5jJn-UZI4KcpzTBfIEgt98YWucuZU2Zg">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30785-4/fulltext?fbclid=IwAR3tcQgOb7CUa3bAxgOL7bsqRPj5jJn-UZI4KcpzTBfIEgt98YWucuZU2Zg</ext-link>) it is shown that most measures have an impact on the reproduction number, and therefore in the cases after 7-14 days.</p>
              <p>Again, the suggested article is published on October 22, 2020, whereas our paper has been submitted to the journal in April. The findings of this research were not available when the article was submitted or after previous rounds of review, nor affect the introduced method presented in this article.</p>
              <p> Considering that the predictions of the model are somehow validated to be good till 10 days in advance there is any result that supports that the prediction is being influenced by the measures?. Could it quantify the change in the behaviour of the prediction after a governmental measure is taken?.</p>
              <p>We think this is a good idea which we have discussed in future works. The introduced method focuses on predicting the spread cases globally, as a novel method to predict spread cases bearing in mind urban factors, governmental policies, and the adjacencies among different countries with deep learning.

              </p>
              <p>1. If the authors have adequately addressed your comments raised in a previous round of review and you feel that this manuscript is now acceptable for publication, you may indicate that here to bypass the “Comments to the Author” section, enter your conflict of interest statement in the “Confidential to Editor” section, and submit your "Accept" recommendation.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: All comments have been addressed</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>2. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>

              <p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
