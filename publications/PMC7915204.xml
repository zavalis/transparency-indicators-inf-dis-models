                  <title>Simple Summary</title>
                  <p>Two different mathematical models are proposed in order to describe the spreading of COVID-19 through the different provinces and regions of Spain and Italy. The models will divide the populations of both countries in three categories: the subpopulation susceptible to be infected of the disease, the subpopulation which is already infected and thus is infectious, and the subpopulation which has already recovered from the disease so is considered immune. The transmission rate is calculated within these models while considering the different locations and, more importantly, the lockdown measures implemented during 2020. The efficiency of these measures is compared between the areas of infection and the different levels of lockdown.</p>

                  <title>Abstract</title>
                  <p>Two discrete mathematical SIR models (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) are proposed for modelling the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) through Spain and Italy. One of the proposed models is delay-free while the other one considers a delay in the propagation of the infection. The objective is to estimate the transmission, also known as infectivity rate, through time taking into account the infection evolution data supplied by the official health care systems in both countries. Such a parameter is estimated through time at different regional levels and it is seen to be strongly dependent on the intervention measures such as the total (except essential activities) or partial levels of lockdown. Typically, the infectivity rate evolves towards a minimum value under total lockdown and it increases again when the confinement measures are partially or totally removed.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>The advance of the disease caused by the corona virus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) surprised world population in the early 2020 as its rapid spread and virulence affected the lives of millions of people and caused thousands of deaths. Given the importance of this situation, a great number of mathematical models explaining the spread of the disease have been proposed [<xref rid="B1-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], with a set of prescribed characteristic parameters defining the infection over time in a given population. While there is a great number of different models we can use to describe a disease like this [<xref rid="B4-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], due to the limited data at the time of writing this paper, we have chosen a SIR model, which fits better the available data. Another reason to use the SIR model, is that it has shown a great range of versatility for many types of epidemiological studies [<xref rid="B7-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Usually, the network of interactions that define the spread of an infectious disease is modelled with differential equations. It involves different types of infected subpopulations, or susceptible to be infected [<xref rid="B13-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], as well as the transitions between them. These transitions and the dynamics that derives from them depend on the type of disease and the circumstances in which the infection occurs. Unfortunately, the countries suffering from COVID-19 are not coherently documenting the state of the disease: the data regarding the impact of the epidemic on the society has shown a great variation depending on the different methods of diagnostics, treatment and surveillance of the affected population [<xref rid="B16-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Even the politics may play a part in the transparency of the provided data [<xref rid="B17-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This paradoxical situation of the data acquisition, plus the inherent difficulties for designing a proper mathematical model, is specially relevant when there is a need to define the infectivity rate. The infectivity rate (<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), can be explained by defining first the force of infection <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, which is the rate at which susceptible individuals contract the infection per capita. This way, the rate at which new infected appear is <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm3"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, being S the value of susceptible subpopulation. This force of infection is proportional to the number of infectious individuals so we define the transmission rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm4"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> as <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm5"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, which will depend on the average number of contacts an individual encounters during certain time and the probability of transmission of the disease in a contact between an infectious individual and a susceptible one [<xref rid="B14-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This is the parameter we can infer from the dynamics of the infected subpopulation. Although traditionally the biggest determinator of the virality of a disease is the Reproduction number [<xref rid="B14-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], we have chosen to study the infectivity rate due to its direct relation to the parameters involved in the strategies for controlling the disease [<xref rid="B20-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The time scale of the data presented in this paper is more adequate with the rapid changing values of the infectivity rate rather than a more traditional not so fluctuating reproduction number. By selecting different countries with similar economy, internal politics, health care system, population density and age and social interactions, the possible interference related to these factors, that may affect the spreading of the disease in a population, are reduced to the minimum. Thus, we have chosen Spain and Italy as they share many of these characteristics rather adequately [<xref rid="B22-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Two different discrete SIR models describing the different regions of Spain and Italy at different organization entity levels (Provinces, Regions or Autonomous Communities and Countries as a whole) will be proposed, taking into account the different stages in which they have experienced the spread of the disease: From the principal one to the following de-escalating lockout stages, or phases. While it is possible that different strains of the virus are spreading at the same time, the general assumption will be that others aspects of the disease, such as the average time of incubation of the virus and the average recovery of an average infectious individual is the same through all of the time measured. Then, the only parameter which is really available to control and comparable between different healthcare strategies and social distancing will be the infectivity rate and it will be calculated in their different lock-down stages given these two models. This paper is structured as follows: In the first two sections, we have done this small introduction and present the SIR models which we will use during our analysis. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-biology-10-00121">Section 3</xref> we will explain the methods for obtaining the infectivity rate and the rest of parameters from the given data. Finally, the results and conclusions derived from them will be presented in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-biology-10-00121">Section 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-biology-10-00121">Section 5</xref>.</p>

              <title>2. The Models</title>
              <p>Two different SIR models will be proposed in this section. In these models, the total population is divided into three different subpopulations: susceptible, infectious and removed subpopulation, as seen in the following transition scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f001">Figure 1</xref>):</p>
              <p>The susceptible and the infectious or infected subpopulation, as their names suggest, correspond respectively to the individuals that are susceptible to be infected and the individuals already infected. The removed subpopulation, also known sometimes as recovered, corresponds to the non-susceptible and non-infected individuals, because they acquire immunity or die. The transition rates governing interactions between the three subpopulations will be described thoroughly by discrete equations representing the proportion of individuals in each subpopulation in one day. The values of the recovery rates (transition from I to R) will be obtained by taking into account medical records from the data acquired from early medical cases [<xref rid="B26-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], while the infectivity rates (transition from S to I) parameters of these models will be later adjusted to the real data.</p>

                <title>2.1. Non-Delayed Model</title>

The main difference would be that in this situation the exposed individuals are not affecting the dynamics in any way different than the susceptible subpopulation.</p>

              <p>An estimation of the value of the infectivity parameter will be made through linear regression using the data provided by the health authorities of Spain and Italy.

Although the territorial divisions in Italy and Spain are different, with 20 and 17 regions/autonomous communities and 107 and 50 provinces respectively, more than <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm28"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>75</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of the regions/autonomous communities are in the range of 500–1500 k inhabitants and <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm29"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>75</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of the provinces of both countries are in the range of 200–1000 k inhabitants, and both of them present a density and population numbers quite similar compared to other countries in Europe. We will study the effect of the lockdown and the prophylactic measures, such as the different levels of social distancing and the probability of infection, on the infectivity rate parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm30"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. The actual data provided from official sources cannot always be used directly to study this parameter as the novelty of the situation does not provide a standardized method for discharging a patient and/or find a reliable exact number of infectious individuals at any time. We will take the values of the accumulated total cases and the daily new infections and new recovered ones, which are the easiest data to find in the official repositories, from the governments of Spain and Italy [<xref rid="B31-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Covid-19 data are available from 24 February for Italy, and the data available for Spain is from 1 January, but we have decided that the first analysis period will be from 18 February to 3 May, when a considerable rise is observed in new daily cases. The analysis in both countries ends at 13 September. The total cases will include the infected, recovered and death individuals, and the current susceptible ones will be all that are left from the total population, which will be 1 as it is normalized.

              <p>The infectivity rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm45"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> will be then calculated in two ways by linear regression assuming the intercept is null: First, the infectious rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm46"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> will be calculated with the data available in each phase of the social distancing measures adopted by the territorial government.

In this way, a graphical representation of the infectivity rate is obtained as if it were a continuous parameter from the day 15 to the last day of the data, which may give more insight of the fluctuations of the infectivity rate in each phase, as well as it show the changes of the lockdown strategies right away.

              <p>In this section we will show the parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm50"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> adjusted by linear regression for the different regions of Spain and Italy based on the SIR models which derive the Equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD8-biology-10-00121">8</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD10-biology-10-00121">10</xref>) respectively. The data for the spreading of Covid-19 disease are available from 24 February for Italy, so the first analysis period of 15 days ends on 9 March when the first calculated infectivity rate is assigned. The data available for Spain is from 1 January, and we have decided that the first analysis period will be from 18 February to 3 May, when a considerable rise is observed in new daily cases. The analysis in both countries ends on 13 September. Additionally, another value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm51"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is daily calculated as the average value for the last previous 15 days. In every case, the curves describing the cumulative and direct values of the infected individuals are smoothed through weighted moving average [<xref rid="B37-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], in order to filter out the possible noises in measurements and bureaucratic errors when publishing the results. The range of the graphs are limited, and out of range values will be considered an outliers. Those values may appear at the beginning of the pandemic when the new cases grow fast and also along summer, when the low number of infectious individuals causes that a little number of new cases increases the rate of infection.</p>

                <title>4.1. Non-Delayed SIR Model</title>
                <p>For the non-delayed SIR model, we get <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f002">Figure 2</xref> from the data obtained from the Italian ministry of health [<xref rid="B38-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
                <p>We can see the different continuous and average infectivity rates calculated for each of the 20 regions of Italy depending on the lockdown stage at which they are in time. A more clear visualization of this fact is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Here the particular value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm52"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for the more than 100 provinces of Italy are also calculated through linear regression for the diverse stages of the lockdown. Then, an histogram for the distribution of the values is made. We can see it more easily at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f003">Figure 3</xref> that the lockdown reduces the infectivity rate for most of the provinces, compared to the normal final state at September.</p>
                <p>The statistics from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f003">Figure 3</xref> are displayed in the following <xref rid="biology-10-00121-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
                <p>Statistically significant differences are observed in the histograms through the use of Z test [<xref rid="B39-biology-10-00121" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], as the size of the samples is large enough. The change in transmission rate has changed significantly between two stages when the <italic>p</italic>-value of the test is low enough. In the corresponding tables for each histogram, the <italic>p</italic>-value indicates the result for the Z test between each stage and the previous one. We can see the influence of the high infectivity rate after the lockdown affecting to all provinces if we look at the mean value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm53"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. The effects of the strict isolation measures are eventually reflected in the mean value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm54"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> at phase 1. Moreover, the variance of the infectivity rates obtained from different provinces of Italy shows that the lockdown induces an homogeneous effect in the populations. The histogram <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="biology-10-00121-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> show that there are significant differences in the value of the infectivity rate at the different phases and normality. In Spain, the same method is used to get the continuous and average infectivity rates for the 17 Autonomous Communities, which are shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f004">Figure 4</xref>.</p>
                <p>Again, as in Italy, we will show the distribution of the infectivity rates of the different provinces of Spain (50) in an histogram for each stage of the lockdown.</p>

                <p>Additionally, we can observe the homogeneity of the infectivity rate from the lockdown. The decrease of <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm55"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> during lockdown is clear, as it can be seen in the mean values and confidence intervals from pre-lockdown and lockdown period.

                <p>As in the previous model, the individual values of the 107 provinces of Italy are also calculated through linear regression for the diverse stages of the lockdown.

                <p>The homogeneity of the values of <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm63"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> at the diverse regions of Italy in the lockdown is maintained as it is in previous model (seen in <xref rid="biology-10-00121-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Also, the effect of social isolation can be seen in phase 1, and there is significant difference between the infectivity rate from the phase 1 and normality. For Spain we will get, as in Italy and the previous model, the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f008">Figure 8</xref> for the infectivity rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm64"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> at each stage of lockdown and each region</p>

              <p>Although the dependence of the values of the infectivity rate on the different stages is not clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f008">Figure 8</xref> it is seen in all the results how the <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm67"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, which is proportional to the average contact rate between individuals, was generally spiking at the early stages, much higher than during the lockdown, and eventually rose again, when the social distancing measures were relaxed. We observe a clear contrast between the delayed and non-delayed models, in such a way that the <italic>p</italic>-values are lower in the delayed model: the differences in <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm68"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> between each stage are more defined that in the non-delayed. In Spain, significant differences of <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm69"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> are observed between the pre-lockdown and lockdown stages, and between the last phase of lockdown de-escalation and the new normality. From the first easing of the measures to the end of the alarm state period, it can not be concluded that there are evidences that the <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm70"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> has changed. On the other hand, in Italy, the transmission rate varies more significantly during the de-escalating phases. Take note that from Equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD8-biology-10-00121">8</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD10-biology-10-00121">10</xref>), the <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm71"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is not only dependent on the new cases of infected individuals, but the total number of infectious people, which is a estimation of the total number of infected individuals presented in the population. Thus, the continuous <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm72"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (blue lines) at the end of summer is not always completely dependent of the new infected individuals (red dotted lines). Observe that in regions such as Abruzzo, Veneto and Calabria in Italy or La Rioja, Asturias in Spain, from Mid-June to Mid-July there are are not many new cases, so the number of total infectious individuals decreases to low levels. Even if it is observed a little growth in new cases, as there is a little number of total infectious individuals, the transmission rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm73"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> calculated is high. For this reason, during the periods when there are few cases, the transmission rate is usually more variable and its value can be higher than during the periods with a bigger number of new and total infectious cases. This situation is observed in the mentioned regions. If <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm74"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is high that does not necessary mean that new cases should be high. We must take into account the number of total infectious there is On the other hand, observe <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f010">Figure 10</xref>a,b where a comparison is made between the infectivity rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm75"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of two provinces and the average of their respective countries. Although Madrid and Bergamo have been specially affected by COVID-19, their <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm76"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> suggest that the initial number of new cases per population was lower than it potentially could be. After the initial lockdown, however, the infectivity rate specially increased in both provinces, suggesting a deficiency or over-relaxation of the measures of social distancing. The contrasts of values of <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm77"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in the different stages of lockdown is even more pronounced in the case of Spain than in the case of Italy: The spike of the infectivity rate is higher during the pre-lockdown stages, and then back to lesser values later, when the prophylactic measures have been implemented. Observe also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f009">Figure 9</xref> that during the lockdown, specially in Spain, when the social interaction was equally restricted in all provinces the variance of the values for <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm78"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is smaller than during the rest of the stages. It is at such times, as the net of social interactions is more prominent, that the diversification of the density of population and the idiosyncrasy of each area is specially poignant.</p>
              <p>We can see at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-10-00121-f009">Figure 9</xref> that the lockdown was specially effective in Spain, as it reduced the average infectivity rate to half in both models.</p>

              <title>6. Conclusions</title>
              <p>We have seen the impact of the limitations of social interactions and prophylactic measures, such as the use of face masks, in the rate of infection within the population of Italy and Spain during the different stages of spreading of COVID-19.</p>
              <p>While there is a clear distinction between the pre-lockdown stages and the lockdown stages, and the “new” normality, authors agree that it is more difficult to establish a contrast between the different intermediate phases, suggesting that the relevant measures affecting the value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm79"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> are not taken during the different phases between the high point of the lockdown and the new normality. Also, it suggest that other factors not measured, such as the use of masks and new habits of public hygiene are also important, as it can be seen in the difference of <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm80"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> between pre-lockdown phases and “new normality”.</p>
              <p>It can be seen from the histograms from Spain that during the stage of minimal social interaction in the strong lockdown, affecting the whole country in sync, the infectivity rate is not only minimal, but much more homogeneous in all provinces than in any other moment. From this evaluation it can be deduced some kind of average “minimum social interaction”, independent of the idiosyncrasy of the province, probably related to the average number of individuals per household and the sanitary infrastructure of a country, which would be quite homogeneous. Even though the results are not as coherent in Italy as they are in Spain, it is feasible that this is due to the fact that early lockdown was not implemented in all the country at the same time, but gradually as the cases increased to uncontrollable numbers. Also, the limitations and social distancing We hope that new data from other countries such as Portugal, France, Sweden, etc... being currently processed will provide us new insight over this problem. Also, new system of classification regarding the data in which the prophylactic measures implemented in society is advised as, more advanced models such as one with multiple subpopulations, related to their asymptomatic or strong reactions to the disease, or SEIR models in which the exposed subpopulation is taken into account will be also studied in further works.</p>
