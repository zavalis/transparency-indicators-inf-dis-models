          <body>
            <p>A novel coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city of Hubei Province, China. Chinese authorities identified that the causative agent was a new coronavirus, and later, the disease was officially named by the World Health Organization (WHO) as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which received considerable global attention.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> On January 30, 2020, WHO announced that it would list the new coronary pneumonia epidemic as an âemergency public health event of international concernâ.<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> As of June 23, 2020, a total of 85,098 confirmed and 4647 deaths had been reported in China.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> And a total of 9,081,678 people are infected worldwide.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
</p>
            <p>Epidemiological evidence shows that COVID-19 has a strong infectious ability.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The mild patients infected by the novel coronavirus are the main source of infection; asymptomatic patients can also be infectious sources, and they are not easy to find.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> These characteristics bring challenges for the prevention and control of the epidemic.</p>
            <p>In the early stage of the epidemic in China, most of the confirmed cases in areas other than Wuhan had a history of travel to or residence in Wuhan and its surrounding areas within 14 d before the onset of the disease.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The total number of cases reported from each province in January 2020 was strongly associated with the total number of travelers from Wuhan.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> These studies suggested that population migration from Wuhan increases the risk of epidemic transmission to other places in China.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Further spread of COVID-19 was of great concern in view of the upcoming Spring Festival 2020 (January 25), during which there are typically 3 billion travel movements over the holiday period.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Output risk assessment from Wuhan to other places in China is beneficial to analyze and control the COVID-19 epidemic.</p>
            <p>To stop transmission of the virus, the Chinese government implemented a series of intervention measures. On January 20, 2020, the management of COVID-19 was upgraded to the highest level pertaining to class A infectious diseases. On January 21, 2020, the Health Commission officially started to release daily disease information on the website. To control the epidemic in Wuhan and delay the spread of the epidemic progression to other regions, Wuhan New Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Epidemic Prevention and Control Headquarters issued Circular No. 1 that from 10:00 on January 23, 2020, public transportation in Wuhan was temporarily suspended, and the passage away from Wuhan was temporarily closed.<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Other public health interventions were also implemented. However, in the early days of the outbreak, the effectiveness of these interventions was questionable, especially the travel restrictions of Wuhan city.</p>
            <p>As recognized by the WHO, mathematical models have played a key role in outbreak forecast and informing evidence-based decisions by health policy-makers.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> A large number of infectious disease dynamics models have so far been publicly released for this epidemic, which can be used for prediction of epidemic trend, development of policy, and evaluation of measures.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> However, few models have been applied to estimate the risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections to evaluate the effectiveness of the travel restrictions of Wuhan city in early epidemic of China. Hu et al. estimated the risk of Wuhan output based on the number of reported cases and the emigration index without model study.<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The previous studies assessed the risk of Wuhan output without considering the infectivity of asymptomatic patients.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>
</p>
            <p>To provide scientific basis for prevention and control in the initial stage of COVID-19, the present study estimated the output risk quantitatively and evaluated the effectiveness of travel restrictions of Wuhan city based on the modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) infectious disease dynamic model and migration data.</p>

                <p>Data were extracted from the following sources: official websites of the National Health Commission of the Peopleâs Republic of China and provincial Health Commissions, WHO Coronavirus Disease Dashboard, and published literature. Data information included the reported cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed cases, deaths, and discharges. The confirmed cases were diagnosed according to <italic>the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Version 3-4)</italic> issued by the National Health Commission of the Peopleâs Republic of China.<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> A case is a confirmed case if the patient has 1 of the following etiological findings: a positive result of COVID-19 nucleic acid test using real-time fluorescent reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) a genetic sequencing result highly homologous to the known COVID-19 virus. Asymptomatic infections are defined as those with no clinical symptoms whose specimens test positive for the pathogen of COVID-19 or serum specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibody.</p>
                <p>In addition, we obtained daily indexes and the proportion of emigration from Wuhan to 30 provinces in China (excluding Hubei, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, China) released by Baidu Migration (<uri xlink:href="https://qianxi.baidu.com/?from=shoubai">https://qianxi.baidu.com/?from=shoubai</uri>, from December 31, 2019 to January 30, 2020).</p>

              <p>Evaluation and response of risk of crucial are of importance for infectious disease threats planning and control. In this study, we assessed the epidemic risk coefficients of each province based on the modified SEIR model and the Wuhan-to-province migration index provided by Baidu Migration. The response measure of output risk, travel restrictions of Wuhan city, was evaluated by the epidemic risk coefficients.</p>
              <p>The epidemiological characteristics of infectious diseases are the basis for prevention and control of infection. The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 are partly different from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Asymptomatic infections are 1 of the infectious sources, accounting for 15.5%-20.2% of cases.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The length of the infectious period and the ability of infection of asymptomatic patients need to be further studied.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>
<italic>The Pneumonia Prevention and Control Plan for New Coronavirus Infection (Third Edition)</italic> issued by the National Health Commission of China stated that COVID-19 asymptomatic infections would be included in prevention and control management.<sup><xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> On April 1, 2020, the Chinese authorities implemented a daily report system for asymptomatic patients to find these people to the greatest extent and reduce infection risk.<sup><xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> We added asymptomatic infections and their output risks of patients and asymptomatic infections to increase the accuracy and application of the risk evaluation.</p>
              <p>Forecasting and analyzing the spread of infectious diseases by dynamic model have demonstrated value in recent outbreaks by informing policy and epidemic management decisions in real-time outbreak response.<sup><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Although many approaches to epidemic modeling exist, SEIR model was chosen for simplicity and speed of deployment.<sup><xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Given substantial uncertainty regarding input parameters for more complicated models and the need to communicate and iterate rapidly with decision makers, we opted not to incorporate social networks to model transmission dynamics. The results of this study showed that the theoretical predictions in January were quite different from the actual incidences due to uncertainty in diagnosis and other issues related to patient presentation at the beginning of the outbreak. There are some differences in the model parameters of the initial epidemic in published literature, setting of which are mainly based on theory and fitting based on the number of confirmed cases reported.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>â<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> The information in early outbreak is limited and circumstances can evolve rapidly. However, estimating risk must be produced within a short time period. To accurately simulate the epidemic, we estimated the parameters based on published literature and the number of confirmed cases reported in the initial stage of the epidemic.</p>
              <p>Wuhan is the location of a central hub in Chinaâs rail and aviation networks. The results of previous studies showed that the total risk coefficients of each province had a high correlation with the reported cumulative numbers of confirmed cases, which had effectiveness of risk evaluation on the initial situation of the outbreak.<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Hu et al. estimated the output risk of Wuhan based on the number of reported cases.<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> It would be lower due to many COVID-19 cases being undocumented in January 2020.<sup><xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> The previous studies assessed the risk of Wuhan output without considering the infectivity of asymptomatic persons.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The output risk factors may be underestimated by approximately 15.5-20.2% without asymptomatic infections.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Jia et al. developed a risk model that leveraged population flow from Wuhan, gross domestic product, and other variables to identify high risk regions.<sup><xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> However, this study treated the risk of daily population migration as homogeneous. Our study assumed the risks of the same number of population moving out were obviously increasing, with the increase of the number of infections in Wuhan.<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In this study, the risk of asymptomatic infections was lower than other published estimates.<sup><xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Note that our value depends on the asymptomatic infections of epidemiological investigation instead of model simulation.</p>
              <p>Earlier studies suggested that population movement would increase the risk of epidemic transmission. The export risks of COVID-19 varied from Wuhan to other provinces of China.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Indeed, our model identified some provinces with a higher-than-expected level of infection, which suggested more community transmission, which was under-performing compared with the benchmark derived from the outflow population from Wuhan. On the other hand, the over-performing provinces with lower trends than expected might have implemented highly successful public health measures. Nevertheless, they may be prone to inaccurate data reporting.</p>
              <p>This study showed that the total risk coefficients of the epidemic lagging by 5 d in each province that had the highest correlation with the reported cumulative numbers of cases reported. The result is close to the research of Hu et al.<sup><xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> The lag time may be related to incubation period, and the time from onset to diagnosis. The assessment of the output risk provides a scientific reference for prediction and warning of the epidemic in each province. And the lag time is conducive to the timely management of epidemic prevention protocols and medical workers, planning of epidemic prevention materials, and implementing the containment strategy.</p>
              <p>The results showed that, whether the implementation of travel restrictions of Wuhan city was delayed for 3 d, 5 d, and 7 d, the output risk would increase by approximately 40%, 55%, and 65%, respectively. In particular, the daily risk coefficients were the highest from the January 23 to the 28. The cause may be that this period is approaching the Spring Festival, and the travel intensity was higher. A series of public health measures, including travel restrictions of Wuhan city effectively, reduced the spread of the epidemic in a timely manner and curbed the development of the new spike in infections.<sup><xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> On the basis of no new cases in Wuhan for a week, Wuhan lifted the traffic control measures on April 8, 2020.<sup><xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>We focused on the relative strength of the epidemic risk in each province rather than the absolute number of cases, although we simulated the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan by using reported data to calibrate the parameters. A contribution of our approach is to robustly characterize the relative risk and geographical distribution of COVID-19 over time. Moreover, our approach is generalizable to other datasets of population emigration. This method can facilitate policy decisions, such as the dynamic monitoring and allocation of resources and manpower.</p>

              <title>Limitations</title>
              <p>This study has some limitations. First, the modified SEIR model is based on the assumption that Wuhan is relatively closed. So, it may impact on the accuracy of epidemic simulation. Second, the estimation of parameters of modified SEIR model is based on the official daily reported cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, which is relatively limited, such as when the pandemic started and the number of people infected at that time. The assessment should be updated in light of new evidence over time. Third, this study only considers the output risk from Wuhan city and does not consider the migration between other provinces and even countries. Fourth, our results are based on the assumption that the number of infected people is uniformly distributed in the out-migration population from Wuhan. Fifth, we do not consider other prevention and control measures other than travel restrictions at the beginning of the epidemic in Wuhan except the travel restrictions of Wuhan city, which may overestimate the output risk coefficients. Finally, this study was conducted on a provincial spatial scale and cannot be applied to smaller spatial scales.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The present study estimated the output risk quantitatively and evaluated the travel restrictions of Wuhan city based on the modified SEIR infectious disease dynamic model. The export risks of COVID-19 varied from Wuhan to other provinces of China. This study demonstrated that the travel restrictions of Wuhan city had reduced the export risk and controlled the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in China effectively in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The implementation of the measure may provide a reference for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic all over the world.</p>
