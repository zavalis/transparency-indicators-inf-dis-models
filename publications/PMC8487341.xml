                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Lockdown measures are the backbone of containment measures for the COVID-19 pandemic both in high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, in view of the inevitably-occurring second and third global covid-19 wave, assessing the success and impact of containment measures on the epidemic curve of COVID-19 and people’s compliance with such measures is crucial for more effective policies. To determine the containment measures influencing the COVID-19 epidemic curve in nine targeted countries across high-, middle-, and low-income nations.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Four HICs (Germany, Sweden, Italy, and South Korea) and five LMICs (Mexico, Colombia, India, Nigeria, and Nepal) were selected to assess the association using interrupted time series analysis of daily case numbers and deaths of COVID-19 considering the following factors: The “stringency index (SI)” indicating how tight the containment measures were implemented in each country; and the level of compliance with the prescribed measures using human mobility data. Additionally, a scoping review was conducted to contextualize the findings.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Most countries implemented quite rigorous lockdown measures, particularly the LMICs (India, Nepal, and Colombia) following the model of HICs (Germany and Italy). Exceptions were Sweden and South Korea, which opted for different strategies. The compliance with the restrictions—measured as mobility related to home office, restraining from leisure activities, non-use of local transport and others—was generally good, except in Sweden and South Korea where the restrictions were limited. The endemic curves and time-series analysis showed that the containment measures were successful in HICs but not in LMICs.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The imposed lockdown measures are alarming, particularly in resource-constrained settings where such measures are independent of the population segment, which drives the virus transmission. Methods for examining people’s movements or hardships that are caused by covid- no work, no food situation are inequitable. Novel and context-adapted approach of dealing with the COVID-19 crisis are therefore crucial.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par13">Soon after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, many countries followed the Chinese example to put emphasis on transmission control through quarantine of infected persons, the isolation of contacts, and then the lockdown of the entire population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The theoretical background was based on a mathematical prediction model about the expected epidemic curve showing that without transmission control, the curve would be very high and stiff but with “non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)”, it would be prolonged but with lower case numbers and thus manageable by the health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Strict lockdown measures were particularly undertaken in the high-income countries (HICs) of Europe and then carried forward by low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), often leading to economic recession, human suffering and public unrest due to job and income loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, there were some different approaches with less stringent lockdown policies such as in Sweden and South Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This provides an opportunity to analyse counter-measures and the level of compliance to such measures leading to the highest impact on the shape of the epidemic curve, five months after the start of the pandemic. Additionally, it enables to investigate if the real-life experience in different countries confirms the previously defined prediction model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and intends to show “when” and “how much” containment measures are successful in low and high income countries which will help to take up evidence based policy decision according to the local context.</p>

                <p id="Par14">Four HICs (Germany, Sweden, Italy, and South Korea), two better-off MICs (Mexico and Colombia), and three LICs with lower economic power (India, Nigeria, and Nepal) were selected in order to reflect the measures and impact of the covid-19 pandemic in countries with different levels of wealth, size and population densities. Academic contacts in these countries facilitated the data collection. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows that large (India, Nigeria, and Mexico) and small countries (Sweden and Nepal) with high (South Korea and India) and low population densities (Sweden and Colombia) were included. The percentage of children within the total population was less in countries with a high Human Development Index (European countries and South Korea) and more if the index was lower (Nigeria, Nepal, and India). Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows that countries with a high Gross Domestic Product (GDP) have a low informal economic sector and the LMICs have a high proportion of “self-employed” or “vulnerable employment” who will suffer most by the lockdown measures. The only exception was South Korea, with a high GDP but yet a considerable informal economic sector, due to its recent history of moving from a LMIC to a HIC.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic, geographic, and developmental characteristics of the 9 target countries</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Country</th><th align="left">Total population (thousands)</th><th align="left">Population density (persons per km<sup>2</sup>)</th><th align="left">Percentage of children (0–14 year) (%)</th><th align="left">Human Development Index (value)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Germany</td><td align="left">83,517</td><td char="." align="char">240</td><td char="." align="char">14</td><td char="." align="char">0.939</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Italy</td><td align="left">60,550</td><td char="." align="char">206</td><td char="." align="char">13</td><td char="." align="char">0.883</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sweden</td><td align="left">10,036</td><td char="." align="char">25</td><td char="." align="char">18</td><td char="." align="char">0.937</td></tr><tr><td align="left">South Korea</td><td char="." align="left">51,225</td><td char="." align="char">527</td><td char="." align="char">13</td><td char="." align="char">0.906</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Colombia</td><td align="left">50,339</td><td char="." align="char">45</td><td char="." align="char">22</td><td char="." align="char">0.761</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mexico</td><td align="left">127,576</td><td char="." align="char">66</td><td char="." align="char">26</td><td char="." align="char">0.767</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Nigeria</td><td char="." align="left">200,964</td><td char="." align="char">221</td><td char="." align="char">45</td><td char="." align="char">0.534</td></tr><tr><td align="left">India</td><td align="left">1,366,418</td><td char="." align="char">460</td><td char="." align="char">26</td><td char="." align="char">0.647</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Nepal</td><td align="left">28,609</td><td char="." align="char">200</td><td char="." align="char">29</td><td char="." align="char">0.579</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data Sources: United Nations: World Population Prospects 2019 (online: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/">https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/</ext-link>);

                <p id="Par15">To complement our findings, a scoping review of the scientific literature was conducted with the following question: “What measures can influence the COVID-19 epidemic curve among the nine targeted countries?” The scoping review, as an ideal approach to determine the scope of a body literature on covid-19 while examining emerging evidence in a short period of time, was the prime choice in this study.</p>
                <p id="Par16">On May 9, 2020, a search was conducted in online databases, PubMed and Cochrane library with key search terms such as “COVID-19”, “measures”, and “factors”. The inclusion criteria were scientific articles with information on influencing factors of COVID-19 epidemic curve and public health measures adopted by nine targeted countries. Observational and intervention studies including qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methodologies, as well as scoping reviews and full text papers in English or Spanish language were included. Preprint scientific studies were included due to the urgency of the pandemic. The excluded articles were letters to the editor, opinions, guidelines, commentaries and editorials. The study selection was done independently by three researchers (TRR, MAC, and RCS). The three sets of literature were then compared. Disagreements on the inclusion or exclusion of literature were solved through discussions or by including a fourth researcher (AK). The search was carried out in three stages. First, titles were evaluated according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Second, the same criteria were applied to the abstract section of the articles retained in the first stage. Third, full text articles and articles without abstract availability in the previous stages were evaluated. However, after completion of the scoping review, new publications came up which will be presented in the “<xref rid="Sec24" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>” Section.</p>

Each country’s national confirmed and deceased cases were collected through a data hub of COVID-19 datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, the COVID-19 related situation on a sub-national level was analyzed. Targeted regions were: Västra Götaland (Sweden), Lombardy (Italy), Baden-Württemberg (Germany), Daegu (South Korea), Kathmandu (Nepal), Nuevo León (Mexico), Abuja (Nigeria), North Santander (Colombia), and Kerala (India). For European regions, data was obtained from the above mentioned repository [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], however, non-European areas were not accessible through the repository, and thus collected through each country’s national or regional official health service websites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Rates of infection and deaths per 100,000 population were estimated for all nine countries based on the study period from January–May 2020 and the corresponding mid-year population size as the denominator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par18">To assess the intensity of lockdown measures in the target countries, the ‘Stringency Index’ (SI) of the strictness in governmental policies was calculated using eight indicators: closure of schools, workplaces, public events, and/or of public transportation; restrictions on gatherings, internal movements, and international travels; and the quarantine requirements. Computation of the index followed the methodology described by Hale et al., which estimated the intensity of governmental measures into a scale from 1 to 100, with 100 indicating the maximum application of all indicators mentioned above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The mean (SD) and percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th) of the SI were computed for each country and sub-country.

                  <p id="Par21">To better understand the impact of the SI on the incidence and mortality as core outcome variables, an interrupted time-series analysis of mortality and morbidity rates was conducted independently per country and sub-country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The SI is the analysis predictor; in order to transform its continuous format into a meaningful intervention measure before processing the time-series analysis, the median value of SI in each country was defined as “intervention one,”. This was based on observations that the SI was able to demonstrate an impact in relation to the baseline values (both the minimum and 25th percentile) at the 50th percentile. A sensitivity analysis was performed to test this assumption; an exception was made for Sweden where the 10th percentile value was used as “intervention one” due to their relatively low stringency measures. Second and third points of interventions were defined based on 75th and 95th percentiles, respectively. In this analysis some countries managed to implement all three interventions, whereas other countries implemented one or two interventions. When two percentiles revealed small differences (&lt; 10%), the higher percentile was used in the regression. “Baseline trend” refers to the change in rate prior to intervention one; “change at first, second, or third interventions” refers to the change in rate immediately after each intervention; “trend after each intervention” refers to the continuous change in rate after the current intervention and until the next intervention; and the “overall trend after all interventions” refers to the change in rate due to all interventions. These four trends were presented as “rates of change per 100,000 population” together with their p-value at 5% significant cut-off.</p>

                  <p id="Par22">A study in Italy demonstrated that the containment measures reduced the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The time lag between implementing measures to the reduction of COVID-19 growth rate was approximately 7–10 days. The analysis in different Italian regions showed that the earlier the measures were taken, the lower was the cumulative incidence. The importance of implementing early measures was also observed in 25 European countries: as countries with the highest mortality (Italy, Spain, and France) were late to implement national restrictions. Sweden adopted fewer restrictions compared to other neighbouring countries and suffered a higher mortality rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par23">Various modelling studies analysed different scenarios to control the spread of COVID-19. A study assessed the effectiveness of social distancing in Italy based on the level of adherence to quarantine. They predicted a three-persons household with each level of complete, nearly-complete, medium, and no quarantine to have 7, 8, 12 and 20 secondary infections, respectively, during 14 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In large households with 6 persons, 16, 19, 29, and 43 secondary infections in 14 days respectively were predicted for each of the quarantine completion level, suggesting that a higher adherence to quarantine and a smaller household contribute to a lower number of secondary cases. In South Korea, during the outbreak, there was a positive correlation of compliance with lockdown measures and a decline in the confirmed cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Likewise, “home office” and the delay of school opening led to a marked transmission reduction.</p>
                  <p id="Par24">Choi and Ki simulated the epidemic in South Korea and predicted nearly 5 million COVID-19 cases without any measures, while the lockdown could reduce the transmission rate by 90% to 99% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The combination of different mitigation measures seems to be crucial for reducing infections and deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], just as the increased compliance with the measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In Veneto, Italy, seventeen days after the lockdown strategy, 658 hospitalized cases (95% CI 618–698) could be prevented and the peak of the curve was delayed by 3 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In Italy, measures such as “red zone” (lockdown in ten towns in Lombardy) effectively contained the spread of the infection and the general lockdown had a positive effect in other regions of Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par25">A modelling study in India found that within 21, 42, and 60 days lockdown periods, the number of cases (378,036 infections without intervention) was reduced to 70,424 after 110 days in the 21 days lockdown-scenario, and was additionally reduced to 42,950 in the 42 days scenario, but no additional reduction by prolonged lockdown of more than 42 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Another modelling study in France showed that the isolation of individuals with no or mild symptoms was not sufficient to reduce the number of confirmed cases, however, both in France and North-Italy, a substantial case reduction could be achieved by a large-scale reduction of social interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A study in South Korea estimated the effective reproduction number (<italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>) to be 1.5 (95% CI 1.4–1.6), the intrinsic growth rate to be 0.6 (95% CI 0.6–0.7) and the “deceleration of growth” to be 0.8 (95% CI 0.7–0.8), which indicate for sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>

There are mainly two types of epidemic curves; in Germany, Italy, and South Korea, a quick increase in cases can be seen followed by a slow-down of the transmission, while there was almost a linear increase in Sweden. In the LMICs, we see an exponential increase of cases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Containment measures were implemented as a response, which in some countries happened before the first case was confirmed (minus values in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), while some were shortly after the first case, and others occurred later in time. In five countries, which had already reached the peak of the wave before May 31, the length of the critical period (from the start of the wave to its peak) was between 44 days (South Korea and Italy) and 90 days (Sweden), with Germany (61 days) in the middle. All LMICs did not reach the peak until 31 May 2020, because they had particularly long critical periods from 90 to 130 days (Colombia, Mexico, Nigeria, India, and Nepal).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases (“cases of infection” or “cases”) and deaths.

                <title>Effective containment measures: scoping review</title>
                <p id="Par46">Main messages from the scoping review about the effect of containment measures on infection rates were that containment measures, particularly when initiated early, could reduce the progression of the disease transmission (Italy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], reduce the basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub> from 2.3 to 0.15 (India) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and delay the peak of the epidemic by 3 days in modelling studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A combination of containment measures is more effective, leading to a reduction of secondary cases by 90 to 99% in South Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In Spain and Italy, particularly the second intervention, when added to the first one, led to the reduction of infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, the lockdown of mild and asymptomatic cases alone did not have much effect in modelling studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and prolonged lockdown beyond 42 days did not have an additional benefit (India) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, fever checking in airports needs a very high coverage to be effective, particularly considering all asymptomatic arrivals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Finding from our review came to the same conclusion—that containment measures ware effective in reducing the transmission dynamics, but only in HICs and only minimal in LMICs.</p>

                <title>Wealth and disease burden</title>
                <p id="Par47">Our participant countries represented a range of income groups whereby Germany, Sweden, South Korea, and Italy belong to the high-income category in contrast to the LMIC group, which engulfs the rest of the countries. The country’s wealth status has apparent implications, which is reflected in the distribution of the cumulative infection and death rates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Higher income nations displayed a sharp increase of both infection and death rates at the early stages of the pandemic, which slowed down 4 to 6 weeks later, with the exception of Sweden which had a less-pronounced decline due to the “relaxed” containment policy. Among the LMICs, the increase of infections was stiffer and started earlier in time and continued throughout without reaching the peak during the observation period. This difference warrants further investigation.</p>

                <title>Assessing the containment measures in LMICs and HICs</title>
                <p id="Par48">The SI as a summary measure of the different components of the containment strategies implemented over time revealed the following (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). High and long lasting SIs were found particularly in LMICs (India, Nepal, and Colombia) and lower SIs and/or shorter duration were observed in HICs, particularly in Sweden, South Korea, and Germany. Mobility data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) reflecting the compliance of people with the lockdown measures also seem to show that populations in LMICs were more compliant than those in HICs.</p>
                <p id="Par49">In South Korea, Germany, and Italy, the containment measures were successful in reducing infection rates and deaths, particularly when several restrictions were combined. In Sweden, the effect was also present but not statistically significant, which is explained by the minimal changes of lifestyle during the epidemic. Conversely, the effect in LMICs was disappointing in relation to strict containment measures imposed, particularly in India, Nepal, and Colombia. Despite the fact that peoples’ compliance with the measures appears satisfactory, these countries have achieved minimal and only temporary reduction of infection rates or deaths. Also at the sub-country level, no apparent or sustained success could be observed. For instance, in Kerala, India, containment measures were particularly strict but only a minimal transient effect on transmission reduction could be observed.</p>

              <sec id="Sec27">
                <title>Likely causes for the unsuccessful containment measures in LMICs</title>
                <p id="Par50">Data from LMICs are usually less reliable than those from HICs. Systematic testing is rarely being done, not even in symptomatic cases, and the number of infections and deaths is mainly health service based. However, the information on the sharp increase of new infections and deaths is worrying enough although the real burden is most likely to be much higher.</p>
                <p id="Par51">We assume that the high proportion of people working in the informal economic sector, particularly those in vulnerable employments (India, 74.5% vs. Germany, 5.7%), explains why lockdown measures are impossible to comply with in poverty areas. “No work, no food” illustrates that the majority of people in these areas cannot afford to stay at home. This is not captured by our human mobility analysis which rests on the ownership of a smart phone and does not reflect the movements of the poor. In other words: the lockdown measures are not followed by a large population segment which drives the virus transmission.</p>

              <sec id="Sec28">
                <title>Comparison with similar studies from across the world</title>
                <p id="Par52">The additional literature search after completing the scoping review and the analysis of data at the earlier stages of the pandemic added the following information: A study including 41 countries showed that containment measures including non-pharmaceutical interventions were effective in reducing Covid-19 transmission, with some measures greater than others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A recent study from India found that the time-varying reproduction number (<italic>R</italic> (t)) was reduced in several states as a result of various containment measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It was shown that the reproduction number increases with higher population density as it facilitates the transmission of the virus. Thus, mobility restrictions could markedly bring down the COVID-19 spread in densely populated regions (see also Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> on population density) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, such restrictions could not be implemented for a long period in LMICs, where the proportion of people belonging to the informal sector is high, as discussed above.</p>
                <p id="Par53">Other studies showed the impact of containment on mobility. A study by Barbieri et al. found in ten countries a decrease of private mobility during the first wave of the pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]: people abstained from walking (11.3% reduction in Iran), cycling or driving a car (10.2% and 13.7% reduction, respectively in Ghana). Also, the use of public transportation decreased the most significantly in Iran (18.7% less use of trams) and Australia (7.2% less use of trains) and Norway (decreased use of buses, −19.4%, and airplanes, −4.9%).</p>
                <p id="Par54">Another recent study which summarized guidance for low-income countries said that authorities in African countries could learn from China to improve emergency responses to pandemics, be more proactive, and be committed to planning and performing long-term plans for coming pandemics. Furthermore, there should be a promotion of hygiene and public participation as a routine application in all communities in Africa. Liaising with medically sophisticated countries will facilitate real-time information, assuring that gaps between advanced countries and LMIC like Africa are reduced. African countries should also increase their capacities to make their anti-epidemic elements such as personal protective equipment and testing kits to flatten the curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par55">These study results were in line with the results of the here presented study (reduced mobility during the lockdown, population density as a risk factor for COVID-19 spread), but did not distinguish between rich and poor countries.</p>

              <title>Study limitations</title>
              <p id="Par56">This study has utilized existing records of national and sub-national infection and death cases as reported by established sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], including the pragmatic measure of SI and Google mobility data as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Just like the case of data reporting for other diseases, the authors acknowledge the possible incorrect disease classification of diagnosis particularly in LMICs including the frequent underreporting of mortality and morbidity data. However, information sources in the current study have been most useful in several recent epidemiological studies. In addition, the SI is deemed as a novel index to be applied in research, but our results suggest plausible interpretations of this index which appear to follow what was expected in the corresponding countries. Since the Google mobile data is prone to several limitations as acknowledged by their providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], we attempted to interpret this information more cautiously and only integrated their records in the descriptive statistics to aid the study discussion.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par57">Compared to HICs, the transmission dynamics seem to follow different paths in LMICs requiring different and more context-specific strategies in order to contain the spread of the virus and protect the most disadvantaged societies. This is certainly a novel challenge for the global health community and experiences from local settings will likely help to shape national and global policies and find new ways of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and its disastrous impact on peoples` lives.</p>
