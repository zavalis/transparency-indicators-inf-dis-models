                <p id="Par1">Recent research shows an increasing interest in the interplay of social networks and infectious diseases. Many studies either neglect explicit changes in health behavior or consider networks to be static, despite empirical evidence that people seek to distance themselves from diseases in social networks. We propose an adaptable steppingstone model that integrates theories of social network formation from sociology, risk perception from health psychology, and infectious diseases from epidemiology. We argue that networking behavior in the context of infectious diseases can be described as a trade-off between the benefits, efforts, and potential harm a connection creates. Agent-based simulations of a specific model case show that: (i) high (perceived) health risks create strong social distancing, thus resulting in low epidemic sizes; (ii) small changes in health behavior can be decisive for whether the outbreak of a disease turns into an epidemic or not; (iii) high benefits for social connections create more ties per agent, providing large numbers of potential transmission routes and opportunities for the disease to travel faster, and (iv) higher costs of maintaining ties with infected others reduce final size of epidemics only when benefits of indirect ties are relatively low. These findings suggest a complex interplay between social network, health behavior, and infectious disease dynamics. Furthermore, they contribute to solving the issue that neglect of explicit health behavior in models of disease spread may create mismatches between observed transmissibility and epidemic sizes of model predictions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par7">In an increasingly globalized world, we face risks of outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, or new strains of influenza. Human behavior is known to have major influence on infectious disease dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Examples are how we interact with one another when we are sick, whether we break social ties over the course of infections, what we believe to know about health risks, and how we derive actions from this information.</p>
              <p id="Par8">Past studies show an increasing interest in this interplay of health behavior and infectious diseases in both sociological and epidemiological scholarship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Mao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], for example, emphasize that neglect of health behavior may create mismatches between observed transmissibility of diseases and epidemic sizes of model predictions. Based on a 2-layer network (contact, information) they predict lower epidemic sizes when more individuals adopt preventive behaviors disseminated through communication networks. Further integration of health behavior, the authors argue, is necessary and requires an interdisciplinary approach combining social sciences, health psychology and epidemiology.</p>
              <p id="Par9">From studies in health psychology we know, for example, that perceived risks of infections may cause people to avoid social gatherings during times of increased risks of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Despite the widely recognized importance of incorporating dynamical aspects in epidemiological contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], many studies on infectious diseases consider social networks to be static, implying that health behavior does not affect social behavior. Static relations, however, do not describe the dynamic nature of our social networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], while disease dynamics is known to be sensitive to topology changes in adaptive networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Leung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] recently addressed the problem of lacking social network dynamics. Using a formal model of disease spread, they showed that social distancing implemented by stochastic rewiring of network ties, rather than dropping edges, and thus keeping average degree constant, has an immediate effect on the epidemic size. High rewiring rates of susceptible agents when connected to infected peers result in a lower epidemic size than in static networks. Moderate rewiring rates, in contrast, result in larger epidemic sizes. The authors propose, however, that individual decision-making is a non-stochastic, but highly complex health behavioral process waiting to be formally integrated into epidemiological social network models. We posit that a more realistic description of epidemics is possible by integrating social network dynamics based on health behavior into epidemiological models. This paper identifies the necessary theories and provides a general model to fill this gap.</p>
              <p id="Par11">Considering health behavior, Funk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] argue that people need to become aware of disease-related information (e.g., personal observations, public information campaigns) to change their behavior. Further, two systematic reviews on airborne diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] conclude that subjective risk perception with regard to (i) the perceived probability of getting infected and (ii) the perceived severity of a disease is the main reason for health-related behaviors in the context of infectious diseases. Thus, a person perceiving risk to be high may prefer to avoid social contacts during a wave of influenza, while a person perceiving risk to be low may not alter social behavior at all [see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The model by Poletti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] also suggests effects on epidemic impact depending on perceived risks and the corresponding behavioral reaction (lowering probability of infection), even for small reductions in contact numbers. Finally, Bish et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] argue that the number and severity of symptoms are significant factors for the duration and degree of separation from social contacts.</p>
              <p id="Par12">The elaborations above demonstrate a complex co-evolution of infectious disease dynamics and social network dynamics mediated by risk perceptions of actors. It remains, however, unclear how this co-evolution comes about. We therefore ask: <italic>How does health behavior shape the co-evolution of epidemics and dynamic social networks?</italic> Despite the enormous increase in the number of studies of disease spread in social networks since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic [e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], we are not aware of any study explicitly considering a choice-based model including health behavior and interdependent dynamics of social networks and infectious disease spread. Modeling such network-related health behavior allows to compare the effects of different control measures against epidemic outbreaks, a crucial factor for policy-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, our work adds to the rich literature on co-evolution between social networks and different types of behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">To answer the question, we provide a general model for the co-evolution of dynamic social networks and infectious diseases mediated by risk perceptions of actors. The model follows an interdisciplinary approach and combines theories of social network formation from sociology and economics, infectious diseases from epidemiology, and individual health behavior from health psychology. Furthermore, rather than using purely stochastic rewiring processes or artificially lowering transmissibility [see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], we address two crucial shortcomings of contemporary models to couple the dynamics of social networks and disease behavior based on a more explicit theoretical mechanism: (i) the integration of dynamic network structure in consideration of (ii) behavioral changes due to infection risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">We first identify the minimal requirements for such a model with solid footing in the literature (“<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Theory</xref>” section), including theory from epidemiological scholarship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and theory on how people form social ties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In addition, we use psychological theory to describe health behavior and how people translate the exposure to health risks into action. We integrate these theories to propose a general model describing the co-evolutionary processes of dynamic social networks and infectious diseases (“<xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">The networking during infectious diseases model (NIDM)</xref>” section). A specific model case (“<xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">A specific model case</xref>” section) implemented as agent-based simulation (“<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Simulation</xref>” section), serves to illustrate how the general model can be tied to specific types of social networks (here: 10 to 50 individuals, such as groups of friends, school classes, extended family, small companies, or teams within larger companies), and how different social, psychological, and disease-related conditions affect the course of epidemics within these networks (“<xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Results and discussion</xref>” section).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> We conclude with the implications of our study and opportunities for further research “<xref rid="Sec20" ref-type="sec">Conclusion and implications</xref>” section.</p>

                <title>Infectious diseases</title>
                <p id="Par15">Infectious diseases differ in many aspects, such as transmission routes (e.g., airborne, sexual contact, animal vectors, food contamination), the symptoms they cause (e.g., fever, coughing, fatigue, diarrhea, muscle aches), the body parts they affect (lungs, skin, inner organs), virulence, the cause of infection (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites), the course and duration of the disease, and many more. However, despite the numerous differences between specific infectious diseases, there are also commonalities that apply to all. The infection rate, or probability of an infection per contact, is central for the spread of any infectious disease and thus an important factor whether the invasion of an infection may turn into an epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, the stages individuals go through during an infection are similar. This progress typically starts with an individual being susceptible to a disease. After being infected with a pathogen, the susceptible individual becomes infectious and possibly symptomatic. Finally, the individual either recovers or dies from the infection. Recovered individuals may either be immune or once again become susceptible to the disease.</p>
                <p id="Par16">This general course of infectious diseases can be translated into the well-known compartmental <italic>SIR model</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], which divides a population into three different compartments according to disease states (<underline>S</underline>usceptible, <underline>I</underline>nfected, and <underline>R</underline>ecovered). Depending on transmission and recovery rates, ordinary differential equations allow predicting different properties of infectious disease dynamics, such as the total number of infected, peaks and duration of epidemics, and effects of vaccines. Models are designed depending on, inter alia, which states of the infection are considered or whether recovered individuals may die, become immune, or become susceptible again.</p>
                <p id="Par17">Despite the undisputed importance of compartmental models in epidemiology, Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] describe the lack of theoretical foundation in behavioral responses and social mixing as a pitfall. Especially the assumption that individuals have the same probability to get in contact with others is delusive, as people get more likely in contact with others who are close to them (spatially, emotionally, characteristically) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. More recent studies addressed this issue by dividing populations into spatially distinct groups, so-called <italic>meta-populations</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], or using network approaches to study the effect of network topology, interpersonal relationships, informational exchange, or protective behavior on disease spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. While static networks provide good approximations when networks change at a much slower pace than diseases spread, an increasing number of studies are concerned with network dynamics and disease dynamics occurring on similar timescales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Model studies on adaptive networks allow unique insights on the non-trivial feedback loop between infectious disease spread and spontaneous changes in human behavior. Game-theoretic approaches study, for example, the conditions that make social distancing a beneficial response to infection risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Studies to model temporary interruption of contacts between infected actors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] show that pausing relationships during epidemics increase the epidemic threshold. The underlying network structure in these studies, however, remains static. In a study to model epidemic dynamics in adaptive networks, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] showed that disease spread is inhibited when susceptible actors choose to distance themselves from infected others. Furthermore, they showed that depending on rewiring rate and initial state of the system, healthy and endemic states can coexist.</p>
                <p id="Par18">While all these approaches impressively show that network dynamics may alter the course of epidemics, they neglect modeling health behavior explicitly.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> We therefore seek to identify the relevant theories to describe how people form their networks and how this behavior differs when being at risk of getting infected with a disease.</p>

As a result, individuals consciously change their networks to their personal advantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par20">Benefits in our general model are considered personal well-being, a combination of social and physical well-being, as suggested by <italic>Social Production Function</italic> theory [<italic>SPF</italic> theory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].

                <title>Health behavior and risk perceptions</title>
                <p id="Par23">Health behaviors affect many everyday decisions including nutritional issues, personal and sexual encounters, or substance use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Regarding infectious diseases, Bish et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] classify health behaviors into three categories: (i) preventive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, mask wearing, vaccinations); (ii) avoidant behaviors (e.g., work absence during a wave of influenza), and (iii) management of disease behaviors (e.g., consulting medical experts). All these behaviors lower or even eliminate the risks of getting infected. Here, we focus on avoidant behaviors, as we expect it to have the greatest effect on social network structures. For social networks this translates to <italic>avoiding potentially infectious social connections</italic>. Such social distancing can be achieved through either choosing not to form a tie to, or breaking an existing tie from, an infectious other. Empirical studies support that social distancing successfully reduces infection risks through link removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], voluntary quarantine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], or avoidance of public places [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] show further that social distancing at the workplace reduces epidemic size. But how do people choose to avoid others when being at risk of infections?</p>
                <p id="Par24">In their systematic review of 30 articles on SARS and avian influenza, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] describe that independent of how different studies conceptualize risk (i.e., subjective expected utility vs. psychometric), the main commonality among all studies is that risk perception is the driving factor for health-related decisions. Further, risk perception is affected mainly by the perceived susceptibility to and the perceived severity of a disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A systemic review by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] emphasizes the subjective nature of perceived susceptibility: people typically make inaccurate predictions about health risks and thus actual and perceived risks of getting infected may differ greatly. While the findings for severity are not as consistent, there is also abundant evidence that the perceived severity of a disease (e.g., expected harm for health, expected fatality) has a major effect on risk assessment as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par25">A behavioral model that describes how individuals make health-related decisions based on the aforementioned considerations is the ego-centered <italic>Health Belief Model</italic> [in short: <italic>HBM</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].

We use the truncated version implying that only benefits of connections at distances 1 and 2 are considered rather than also providing benefits for longer distances. The model represents that people do not only benefit from direct contacts by receiving help, support, information, etc., but that they can also obtain benefits indirectly from others connected to direct contacts.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Note that the CM is a model typically describing social contexts of limited group size, such as groups of friends, school classes, extended family, small companies, or teams within larger companies. Furthermore, while the CM is an ad hoc choice, it contains characteristics relevant for infectious diseases. Consider a sick person, who receives care by direct friends (doing groceries, taking over chores). In addition, friends of friends may be beneficial, for example by enabling the friend to help (taking over his/her chores) or in the form of practical matters (borrowing an inhaler, providing information on care).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> Additionally, the model provides an interesting example for the co-evolution of social networks and infectious diseases as networking behavior depends on benefits from direct and indirect connections, while diseases are transmitted only between actors in direct connection.</p>

These parameters fall into two categories: (i) ego-centered utility parameters and (ii) network parameters. We decided on a minimal but expressive selection of parameter variations that allows to investigate the effects of each model component on overall behavior. That is, we varied only one parameter per term in the utility function (i.e., benefit of indirect ties for social benefits, cost increase for infected direct ties for social maintenance costs, disease severity as property of diseases and risk perception as property of agents for potential harm of infections), and selected settings that allow strong variations in dynamics. Further, we used a limited number of fixed values rather than randomized values for each simulation run. This allows to disentangle model behavior with regard to parameter settings and stochastic processes of the simulations, and to exercise more control over the parameter combinations we believe to be of interest.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overview of CIDM parameters</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Parameter</th><th align="left">Admissible</th><th align="left">Used</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="3">I.

To understand how network dynamics shape the course of epidemics, we use regression analyses of simulation data [cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] with regard to: (i) the proportion of recovered agents at the end of each simulation (<italic>final size of the epidemic</italic>, or short: <italic>final size</italic>) and (ii) the number of time steps until all once infected agents have recovered (<italic>duration of the epidemic</italic> or short: <italic>duration</italic>). To disentangle how much of our results are driven by parameter settings and how much is due to stochasticity of the simulation, we use two-level random-intercept regressions (level 2: 360 parameter combinations; level 1: 100 simulation runs). Random elements in the simulation are: (i) agent who is initially infected; (ii) order of agents that change their disease states on network connections; (iii) which network connections are considered and in which order. Furthermore, we create four models, each based on the previous model: (i) <italic>Empty</italic>, (ii) <italic>CIDM effects</italic>, (iii) <italic>Network effects</italic>, and (iv) <italic>Interaction effects</italic>. The Empty model shows how much unexplained variance is due to stochasticity between and within the same parameter settings. It further allows to compare the reduction of unexplained variance when controlled for the varied CIDM model parameters (CIDM effects model). The Network effects model further controls for network measures (network density, degree of patient-0), while the Interaction effects model adds statistically significant interaction effects of all previously described main effects.

The statistical model estimates how the logit of final size can be approximated linearly by a combination of the parameters. Further, we use two-level random-intercept linear regression to analyze the model with regard to duration of the epidemic.</p>

              <p id="Par64">For visual inspection of the progression of epidemics we generate SIR model plots, a method commonly used to display the temporal development of compartments during epidemics. We plot only time steps relevant for the epidemics. That is, rather than showing all simulated time steps, plots begin 10 time steps prior to the introduction of a disease (epidemic stage) and display 80 time steps in total. Next to showing the dynamics over all simulations, we also report the dynamics for networks in which agents change relations as a consequence of the introduction of a disease next to the dynamics for simulation runs in which this does not happen. Although we never actively turned off the option to change ties, there are quite some parameter constellations in which actors do not have a reason to change ties. A comparison between networks with and without tie changes therefore allows a clearer picture of the effects of network dynamics on epidemics.</p>
              <p id="Par65">To relate the network and disease dynamics to some overall network characteristics, we compute several characteristics of networks at different moments during the simulation. Density is computed as the proportion of all possible connections present in the network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref> p. 101 ff.]. Clustering is calculated as the average proportion of closed triads over the number of all possible triads per agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Finally, closeness is computed by reversing the normalized average distance between any two nodes in the network; network size (<italic>N</italic>) is imputed as distance for pairs of nodes that are not connected through any path in the network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, p. 163].

Column 1, for example, shows the progression of epidemics over time. While in both cases (rows 2 and 3), after the introduction of the disease at time step 10, the proportion of infected agents increases and peaks at approximately time step 21 (orange line), the peak for simulation runs with network changes is significantly lower. At the same time, average degree drops from about 6 to below 5 ties per agent in row 2, while average degree remains stable in row 3. Considering that networks were pairwise stable before the initial infection, the average number of 3.41 network changes per agent (sum of dissolution and creation of ties) is caused and mainly driven by the presence of infectious agents. Additionally, we observe that even more network changes were initiated by agents trying to connect to others (on average 18.00 tie requests per agent).

That is because higher social benefits may outweigh the potential harm of infections, and thus agents are more likely to stay connected. This causes more agents to get infected. Furthermore, the results of our model suggest that higher numbers of infected require more time for all agents to recover. Note that the longer duration is not an inevitable consequence of larger final sizes, as more intense epidemics may create many simultaneously infected agents without significant impact on duration.</p>

That is because more severe diseases and higher costs for infected ties reduce the net benefit of a relationship to such a degree that potential costs of infections or existing costs exceed the social gains of the relation to an infected agent. Consequently, more agents disconnect from their partner, causing less agents to be infected, which in turn requires less time steps for the disease to disappear.</p>
                <p id="Par73">Finally, larger networks result in higher proportions of infected agents and longer lasting epidemics. The effect on duration is straightforward, as more consecutively infected agents require more time to recover. The effect on final size, however, is not intuitively comprehensible on its own.

The positive effect of higher degrees for patient-0 can be explained with statistical probabilities.

                <p id="Par75">Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> shows a negative relationship between network size and density. Hence, larger networks have a lower proportion of actual connections compared to potential connections. Network size, however, has a positive effect on average degree. In other words, when networks grow larger the overall number of connections increases while fewer potential connections are formed. Applying the previous argument of statistical probabilities in context of average degree, we observe that a larger total number of connections increases the chance for a disease to spread.

As a result, more connections remain in larger networks providing more potential transmission routes. Consequently, in large networks agents simply cannot dissolve enough ties to distance themselves from the disease sufficiently resulting in almost all agents getting infected in every simulation run. A comparison of disease dynamics between simulation runs with and without network changes during epidemics (Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> in <xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>) shows that the differences of final size and duration of epidemics between different network sizes is largely driven by agents cutting ties and not merely an effect of higher average degrees in larger networks.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Disease and network dynamics by network size. Column 1 shows plots for the median proportional changes of agents according to disease states (yellow, orange, and blue lines), changes in median average network degree (gray lines), and interquartile ranges (shaded areas around median lines) over time.

                <p id="Par77">Furthermore, we observe a negative effect of network size on the duration of epidemics when combined with density and degree of patient-0 (<italic>Network effects</italic>, Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). That is, epidemics last longer when: (i) network size decreases, (ii) the network is less dense, or (iii) patient-0 has more ties. At first sight, these results may not seem plausible. In fact, networks with 10 agents have the lowest average duration of epidemics (18.406 time steps, see Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), while networks with 25 agents have the longest lasting epidemics on average (21.999 time steps). The largest simulated networks with 50 agents, however, show a decrease in average duration of epidemics (20.971 time steps). This non-linear effect for the duration of epidemics is explained by two opposing factors: first, the larger a network gets (assuming constant average degree) the more time is needed to infect the entire network. Second, the larger the network the larger the average degree (see Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). As discussed earlier, larger average degrees result in higher chances to spread a disease. Consequently, larger average degrees increase the likelihood for disease transmissions per time step and therefore facilitate faster disease spread than lower average degrees. Networks up to 25 agents approximate the tipping point of these opposing effects: smaller networks are large enough to slow down disease spread stronger than average degree speeds it up.</p>
                <p id="Par78">Note that the relation between network size, network density, and average degree is an artifact of the CM. Although implications of degree scaling with network size become more unrealistic the larger the networks get, it illustrates that dynamics can significantly change with network size. Furthermore, it shows the importance of choosing appropriate network formation models for specific model cases.</p>

              <title>Conclusion and implications</title>
              <p id="Par85">The role of social networks in the spread of infectious diseases has gained more attention in recent years. Networks are commonly considered static or network dynamics are modeled as random processes devoid of health behavioral foundations [see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We know, however, that people deliberately seek to distance themselves from diseases in social networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], or are instructed to distance themselves from others at times of increased risk of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par86">To address this, we propose the <italic>Networking during Infectious Diseases Model</italic> (<italic>NIDM</italic>), a highly adaptable steppingstone model for the co-evolution of social networks and infectious diseases. This model combines theories of social network formation from sociology, infectious diseases from epidemiology, and individual health behavior from social psychology. We argue that networking behavior in the context of infectious diseases is a trade-off between the social well-being a contact creates, the costs required to maintain a social tie, and the potential physical harm infectious contacts create. Furthermore, we created a specific model case of the NIDM based on the truncated version of the <italic>Connections Model</italic> [<italic>CM</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], a model typically describing social contexts of limited group size, including a multi-agent simulation in which agents deliberately distance themselves from infectious contacts in social networks whenever the potential harm of getting infected through a tie outweighs its social benefit.</p>
              <p id="Par87">Based on our simulations, we gain a number of theoretical insights: we find average degree as a major determinant for epidemic size and duration of epidemics. That is, larger numbers of connections provide more opportunities for disease spread, thus causing more agents to get infected and shorter epidemics. Furthermore, we see a highly interdependent process between the properties of agents, diseases, networks, and epidemics: the higher the (perceived) risks of a disease, the lower the net benefit of a tie, the stronger the social distancing, and consequently the lower the epidemic size. While these results align with our expectations, we gained more surprising insights thanks to our novel network approach. First, networks with benefits for social connections that induce many ties per agent, provide large numbers of potential transmission routes, and consequently allow the disease to travel faster. Second, higher costs of maintaining ties with infected others reduce final size of epidemics only when benefits of indirect ties are relatively low. Third, we find that small changes in social behavior have large effects on the epidemic, which may be decisive for whether the outbreak of a disease turns into an epidemic or not.</p>
              <p id="Par88">Our theoretical outcomes are in line with empirical observations and other model studies, inter alia, from Ahmed et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and Danon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. The former is a review of empirical studies that showed reduction in the number of infections and lower epidemic peaks due to workplace social distancing. The latter is an epidemic network model considering the social structure of populations suggesting that high average degrees result in increases of final size of epidemics. Similar to Poletti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], our results suggest that even small reductions in contact numbers can reduce epidemic impact. While in line with the results of Leung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] (strong stochastic rewiring creates small epidemic sizes, moderate stochastic rewiring creates large epidemic sizes), our model can provide a more explicit theoretical mechanism for their findings. More precisely, our model provides a tool to improve models of infectious diseases by adding network formation processes based on theories from sociology and health psychology, rather than using purely stochastic rewiring processes or artificially lowering transmissibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Additionally, our model has proven to be useful to reveal previously unknown and less intuitive mechanisms (e.g., higher costs of maintaining ties with infected others reduce final size of epidemics only when benefits of indirect ties are relatively low). Furthermore, we contribute to solving the issue that neglect of health behaviors may create mismatches between observed transmissibility of diseases and epidemic sizes of model predictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although some of our theoretical insight could help to understand earlier empirical findings, the empirical validity of our new predictions needs tailored empirical testing in subsequent studies.</p>
              <p id="Par89">It is most important to stress that our general model, the NIDM is a highly adaptive steppingstone to capture the basic characteristics of the co-evolution of dynamic social networks and infectious disease dynamics, which allows many opportunities for extensions and specifications in each part of the model. First, social utilities, and thus resulting network structures, can be modeled with regard to context (social, disease, cultural). HIV, for example, is typically modeled using sexual contact networks (benefits for direct contacts only) that allow great control over single contacts (large <inline-formula id="IEq234"><alternatives><tex-math id="M497">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Second, diseases can be defined according to their objective risks (lethality, stigma, financial), disease states, and treatments. As there is no cure yet for HIV, infected individuals do not recover but remain infected until death. Adoption of preventive behaviors (e.g., intake of PrEP) lowers or may even eliminate the probability of transmission.

              <p id="Par90">It is furthermore important to stress that any specific model case of the NIDM will come with limitations depending on the modeling choices made. While our current model case, for example, the <italic>Connections during Infectious Diseases Model</italic> (<italic>CIDM</italic>), provides an interesting interplay of social and infectious disease dynamics, the CM is designed and typically used to describe small networks. Our simulations suggest that the CM is not feasible for network sizes of 50 and above, as average degree grows with network size ultimately causing all agents to get infected. One approach to realize larger plausible social networks could be the extension of the CM with an explicit saturation term for the number of social relations. Another approach is to design a different baseline utility to describe the utility of social relations for a specific context. Especially the choice of social contexts need to be considered carefully. In friendship networks, for example, we would expect to observe triadic closure, and thus increasing network density and clustering, when indirect contacts are beneficial. Thus, professional networks, as studied by Ahmed et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], seem more plausible as an application for the CM as baseline utility, as indirect contacts may provide benefit through access to rare information unavailable through direct contacts, without the same likelihood for closing the triad. Further, while it seems plausible that agents assess health risk on local information, the assumption that agents have complete knowledge about the contacts of potential new network partners is not quite realistic. Still, we think that in a realistic process of network formation, people investigate into relations before establishing certain ties. Our assumption can also be interpreted as a simplification of this process, assuming that people indeed are able to obtain this information if they want to establish a relation. Alternatively, one could investigate alternative assumptions, such as random creation of new ties followed by dissolution if the relation is not satisfactory. Furthermore, due to low value and variance of network clustering in the CIDM, we cannot make inferences on how networks with dynamic clusters affect the course of epidemics. Empirically, we know that social networks are typically highly clustered (a property that hardly emerged in our networks) while having small average path lengths (<italic>small worlds</italic>) and that these properties can facilitate disease spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Furthermore, people differ in how they perceive risks and translate this into action. It follows, that an outbreak in a cluster of individuals perceiving risks to be high may prevent an epidemic, while a few low-risk individuals in a high-risk population may accelerate disease spread.</p>
              <p id="Par91">In conclusion, our theoretical insights suggest that modeling health behavior explicitly in network models of disease spread can help to gain a broader theoretical foundation and deeper insights into the co-evolutionary processes of dynamic social networks and infectious diseases. Furthermore, the steppingstone model we propose—the <italic>Networking during Infectious Diseases Model (NIDM)</italic>—has proven to be a valuable tool for such an undertaking.</p>

A comparison of the two figures shows that epidemics in networks where ties are being cut (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) have a significantly lower final size and mostly shorter duration across all network sizes. Furthermore, epidemics without network changes show hardly any variance in final size or duration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Variance in epidemic measures is therefore not merely an effect of average degree in different network sizes, but sensitive to network changes of agents trying to distance themselves from the disease. An integrated discussion of these results can be found in section Network properties.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Disease dynamics by network size in network with network changes.

It turns out that in a considerable portion of the simulation runs, agents do not see reasons to change their ties given their anticipated benefits and costs of ties even though some of their neighbors are infected by the diseases. By comparing these simulations with the ones in which agents do indeed change ties to distance themselves from others (see I.II. and I.III. in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>), we observe that in the runs with network changes attack rate is on average <inline-formula id="IEq238"><alternatives><tex-math id="M505">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

One must realize that within the CM-model, density hardly varies given network size and as a result if we analyze data for one network size only and we do not control for the degree of patient-0, there is no effect of density. However, if we control for degree of patient-0 for a given network size, the negative effect can be interpreted as a compensation for the overestimation of the effect of patient-0 for the whole network. If we analyze data for different network sizes simultaneously, the density effect interferes with the effect of network size discussed above.</p>
