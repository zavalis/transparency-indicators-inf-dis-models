                  <p>COVID-19 test sensitivity and specificity have been widely examined and discussed, yet optimal use of these tests will depend on the goals of testing, the population or setting, and the anticipated underlying disease prevalence.

                  <p>Increasing testing frequency was associated with a non-linear positive effect on cases averted over 100 days. While precise reductions in cumulative number of infections depended on community disease prevalence, testing every 3 days versus every 14 days (even with a lower sensitivity test) reduces the disease burden substantially. Pooling provided cost savings and made a high-frequency approach practical; one high-performing strategy, testing every 3 days, yielded per person per day costs as low as $1.32.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>As schools and businesses re-open and attempt to stay open, promptly detecting people with infectious COVID-19 is essential, especially as the risk of transmission may be expected to increase as contact networks increase in size and complexity [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248783.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recommended actions to attenuate spread include symptom checking, monitoring underlying community prevalence, and responsive policy adjustment. In addition to robust public health measures, successful return to normalcy will be accelerated and hopefully sustained by optimal COVID-19 testing strategies. Despite being commonly recommended, little guidance suggests the right approach to testing and how best to balance cost, test selection, results delays, the value of sample pooling, and how changing local disease prevalence should inform strategy adjustments.</p>
              <p>Throughout the pandemic the number and variety of tests for detecting active infection have steadily increased [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Current tests include nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) such as reverse-transcription or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), template mediated amplification (TMA), nicking enzyme amplification reaction (NEAR), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), nucleic acid hybridization, viral metagenomic sequencing, and CRISPR-based assays. Most Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) tests are approved for symptomatic patients, but not all are validated in an asymptomatic population [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite these scientific advancements, there is scant guidance on how to apply a specific technology in the context of the underlying population and the goal of testing, such as diagnosis of an individual versus surveillance of a group. Cost, turnaround time, accuracy, and convenience in sample collection all play a role in achieving a rate of testing that achieves a goal of detecting and preventing transmission in a cohort. A testing strategy is not feasible if the cost per test at the individual level is too high, or the time to obtain results is too long, resulting in possible transmission while positive test results are in transit or missing an opportunity to attend work or school if the result is negative. To increase test processing efficiency and reduce cost, pooling of samples is a potential solution provided there is minimal degradation in test performance due to dilution, but a strategy should be devised carefully. Successful pooling strategies rely on a clear understanding of the test’s limit of detection (LOD), sensitivity, specificity, and the prevalence of disease in the population being tested [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Testing in large cohort settings such as schools and businesses that require continued surveillance can ensure that facilities remain open safely for the greatest number of people. We model various scenarios of test sensitivity and specificity, testing frequency, cost, and pooling to illustrate the range of practical and sustainable surveillance strategies.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>To compare the effects of test sensitivity and specificity, test frequency, and the impact of pooling we considered a classical epidemiological susceptible, infectious-asymptomatic, infectious-symptomatic, removed (SIR) compartmental model for the tested population. That is, individuals move from one compartment to another as they transition from susceptible to infectious to removed. To account for the introduction of infections from the surrounding community, we added a time-dependent term which represents the rate (in people/time) of infections from outside interactions continuously in time. With frequent testing, this external forcing drives the behavior of the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248783.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Schematic representation of the model.</title>
                  <p>The model simulates testing for a common group of people who mix continuously in an institution (i.e., in a school or office) and are subject to the introduction of infection from the surrounding unmonitored community. The framework couples regular testing, described by a handful of tunable parameters, to a disease model. The disease model is dynamic in time, and infections may originate both from inside-the-institution mixing and from the surrounding community at varying rates depending on prevalence.</p>

              </fig>
              <p>We examine two scenarios for this forcing. The first is a relatively low and more-or-less constant rate of introduced infections, with data from the 7-day rolling average of the case count in Fayette County, Pennsylvania for the 100 days beginning March 26, 2020, as reported in the <italic>New York Times</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This low-growth profile is reported as panel (a) in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248783.g002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248783.g004">4</xref>. The second scenario used for high-growth external community prevalence is the seven-day rolling average of daily case counts in Miami-Dade County, Florida, for the 100 days beginning June 16, 2020. This profile is shown in panel (b) in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248783.g002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248783.g004">4</xref>. In both profiles, we scaled the cases given by the relative population in our model, which we chose to be 1,500. It should be noted that the case counts in Miami-Dade County over this time period are outliers compared to case counts in other counties across the US over the past ten months. These cases are chosen for illustration to show the widest array of possible scenarios. To model symptom checking we solve the forced SIR model each day, and, at the end of the day, we remove the appropriate fraction of individuals from the infectious-symptomatic compartment. To model pooled testing with symptom tracking, when <italic>τ</italic> divides the day, in addition to removal due to symptom tracking from the infectious-symptomatic compartment, there is removal from both infectious compartments due to positive tests. The initial test is on day zero. To account for possible delays in receiving test results due to laboratory processing, we also allow for a delay parameter, <italic>d</italic>. When pooling samples, we adjust for test sensitivity and applied a linear deduction for pooling of 0.00323, consistent with minimal sample dilution or degradation in a nasal or nasopharyngeal sample [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Other deductions may be more appropriate in different settings, such as saliva sampling [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our model allows for a varied percent of those that are infected to choose to comply with isolation protocols; in the scenarios presented, we set this tunable assumption to be perfect compliance. We assume the basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub> is 2.5 and the average period of infectiousness is 4.5 days [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>

              <p>We do not include an “exposed” category as is often done for compartmental models but account for the shorter time a person is infectious rather than the longer period of time they are infected. Our model includes symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious individuals with daily symptom tracking. In the results that follow we assume 40% of infections are asymptomatic [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and symptom tracking will catch 66% of symptomatic infections [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Individuals can move directly from asymptomatic to removed or from asymptomatic, to symptomatic to removed.</p>
              <p>The initial conditions are chosen from the average of population-scaled new confirmed cases reported by the <italic>New York Times</italic> for September 23, 2020 in a sample of counties scaled by average number of infectious days. This results in a starting value of 0.675 infections for a population of size 1,500. We take the conservative approach of assuming no one in the population has immunity to the virus based on previous infection. In the tests that follow we vary the testing frequency (<italic>τ</italic>), delay in the return of results (<italic>d</italic>), number of samples pooled (<italic>m</italic>), sensitivity of the test on one sample, and specificity of the test. We computed the cost of each testing strategy at the per person per day level, over 100 days. When pooling (<italic>m</italic>&gt;1), we assumed a simple 2-stage Dorfman testing process in which each individual in a positive pool is retested individually using a high-sensitivity diagnostic test at $100 per test. We then calculated the expected number of tests required to complete each round of testing. The complete scientific code is available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0248783.s001">S1 File</xref>.

              <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248783.g002">Fig 2</xref> demonstrates scenarios of testing frequency at sensitivities of 98% with a two-day delay in receiving results during which mixing continues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248783.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>), 98% sensitivity with no delay in receiving results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248783.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>), and 60% sensitivity with no delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248783.g002">Fig 2G and 2H</xref>) to simulate testing by various technologies such as PCR with lags between sample collection and centralized laboratory testing, antigen detection, and LAMP. As there are little data on the performance of some tests in asymptomatic people, we used more conservative sensitivity estimates aligning to published LOD for specific devices from the FDA [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The sawtooth pattern is the result of removal of infected persons from the population.</p>
              <p>Any testing strategy is better than none at all, and as expected, tests with increased sensitivities perform better for a given time frequency. At the most lenient frequency considered, every 14 days, the number of infections is reduced approximately 21–56% (<xref rid="pone.0248783.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) compared to no testing at all. Each scenario can be explored comparatively. For example, at a test sensitivity of 80%, testing every day reduces the number of cumulative infections relative to no testing by 95.9–99.9% while testing every 14 days reduced the number of cumulative infections at day 100 relative to no testing by only 26.0–27.1%. Increased testing frequency results in a nonlinear decrease in cumulative infections over time, with daily testing resulting in the fewest cumulative infections at 100 days after implementing the testing strategy at any of the sensitivities shown. Importantly, at sensitivities of 98% our models predict that a two-day delay in results (by send-out PCR, for example) will result in just a 31% reduction in infections experienced at a 14-day testing frequency; however, as the testing frequency is increased, even with the two-day delay, the number of missed infections goes down rapidly to a 99% reduction from no testing at all at a daily testing frequency.</p>

                    <p>* Cost calculation assumes a test with a 98% sensitivity and 0-day delay in returning results costs $120, a 98% sensitive test with a 2-day delay in results costs $100, an 80% sensitive test costs $50, and a 60% sensitive test costs $20. All (true and false) positive tests are confirmed using a $100 test. The distribution of positive tests among pooled samples is uniform as is consistent with the homogeneous mixing assumptions of the SIR model, and we assume everyone in a pool that is positive will undergo a confirmatory test.</p>

              <p>Next we looked at testing strategies that incorporate pooling. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248783.g003">Fig 3</xref> combines a weekly and every 3 day testing strategy with 98% sensitive tests with varying time delay, and pooling tests in samples of 2, 5, 10, and 30. Pooling potentially reduces the sensitivity of the tests, resulting in more missed infections. This can be overcome by an increase in test frequency, allowed by the cost savings of pooling. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248783.g004">Fig 4</xref> weighs cost against testing frequency and pooling size, both with confirmatory and without confirmatory testing of positive pools. Without confirmatory testing, the cost per person decreases dramatically.</p>

              <p>Our findings demonstrate that it is not only critical to choose the right test in terms of performance in asymptomatic individuals, but to use the test in the defined population at the optimal frequency to reduce the risk of case escalation. Optimization is further enhanced at the population level by understanding of underlying disease prevalence and utilization of pooling to reduce cost and increase efficiency. The “ideal” test strategy must be balanced with the practicalities of cost per person to ensure sustainability. For example, daily testing with a 60% sensitive test attenuates community spread, but at a cost of $30.11 per person per day with confirmatory testing, or $20.00 without, may not be possible. Using a 60% sensitive test less frequently reduces expense but sacrifices significant performance. A 98% sensitive test with no delay in results administered every 3 days with pools of 30 people, and no confirmatory test offered by the institution costs less than $1.50 per person per day, with high performance. Even with a highly specific (99.5%) test such as a PCR, in a low prevalence community with large pools, false positives may still become an issue. The previous example results in 253 false positives over 100 days, highlighting the importance of confirmatory testing. The model demonstrates that frequency of testing, test sensitivity, turn-around time, and the external community prevalence are all important factors to consider, and there is often more than one testing strategy to achieve the desired level of performance. The computational code is available as an on line supplement, and an easy-to-use web-based simulator to test various scenarios is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://calculator.unitedinresearch.com/">https://calculator.unitedinresearch.com/</ext-link>. The ability to test different strategies under a variety of assumptions is especially important as we learn more about the performance of tests in asymptomatic populations over time.</p>
              <p>With these scenarios in hand, institutions can make an informed operational choice, devise pods or cohorts to be tested by pooling and potentially isolated if positive, and create clear communication about a surveillance rationale. Acknowledging a dynamic community prevalence, the model can be re-run, and the testing strategy can be optimized to maximize benefit at the lost cost and least amount of disruption.</p>
              <p>The frequency of test usage to minimize amplification of infection and allow schools and worksites to remain open is an important factor. Given the cost of high frequency testing, we demonstrate the value of pooling of samples to increase efficiency, particularly in areas with lower population prevalence. As background prevalence increases, the value of pooling diminishes as the likelihood of a positive pool will rise, but even a pool of two to three samples results in a dramatic reduction in the need for individual sample analysis. As noted above, with an extremely low prevalence, even in the case of a 99.5% specific test, false positives are much more likely than true positives and confirmatory testing may be necessary. A 90% specificity test would result in an untenable number of false positives over the course of 100 days without confirmatory testing. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248783.g004">Fig 4</xref>, in order to achieve a minimal cost approach that includes confirmatory testing, one must balance pool size with frequency. Without confirmatory testing, costs drop dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248783.g004">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>). The Dorfman protocol for pooled testing we use is suboptimal compared to a sequential split-pool strategy [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. More sophisticated confirmatory testing strategies exist that would further lower costs and reduce the likelihood that uninfected individuals are sent home, such as sub-pooling of positive pools without individual level testing, each with benefits and disadvantages [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248783.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study confirms and extends previous work. Paltiel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] considered a compartment-based model simulating an abbreviated 80-day semester in a highly-residential college-campus-type setting. Across all scenarios considered, test frequency was more associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. That modeling exercise also suggested that symptom-based screening alone is insufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios considered. Using a model for viral loads in individuals, Larremore et al. [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] studied surveillance effectiveness using an agent-based modeling framework which accounts for test sensitivities, frequency, and sample-to-answer reporting time. The results indicate that frequency of testing and the speed of reporting are the principal contributors to surveillance effectiveness. The results also suggest that the impact of high sensitivity on surveillance effectiveness is relatively small.</p>
              <p>Populations housed in long-term care facilities are especially vulnerable to COVID-19; surveillance programs designed for these settings may have different goals and tolerances for infection risk than those designed to maintain functionality for other institutions. Smith and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] built a complex modeling framework for long-term care facilities including simulations of the detailed inter-individual contact networks describing patient-staff interactions in such settings. This work showed that symptom-based screening by itself had limited effectiveness. Testing upon admission detected most asymptomatic cases upon entry but missed potential introductions from staff. Random daily testing was determined to be, overall, an inefficient use of resources. This points to the opportunity for pooled testing as an effective and efficient COVID-19 surveillance strategy for long-term care facilities with limited resources.</p>
              <p>Since our work focuses on screening and not performing diagnostic testing, the actual sensitivity of the various available COVID tests for this purpose is not entirely clear. The original testing approaches for COVID-19 focused on the high sensitivity required for diagnosis by clinicians in all stages of the acute period of COVID-19 through detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA performed on patients with a high pretest probability of disease. This paradigm focused on high sensitivity tests with the performance feature of very low NAAT detectable units/mL (NDU/mL) with a goal of diagnosing patients even if past the contagious period. These tests were not optimized nor validated in terms of sensitivity for the detection of infectious individuals that might spread disease in schools, the workplace or other social situations.</p>
              <p>Several studies looking at the ability to culture virus from samples collected from infected individuals have established that RNA copy numbers of 1,000,000 RNA copies/ml or higher are required for any consistent success in viral culture [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Based on contact tracing, this defined window of elevated RNA copy numbers starting 2–3 days prior to onset of symptoms and ending 5–9 days after symptom onset corresponds to most if not all cases of transmission. Studies of asymptomatic spreading suggests a very similar window of transmissibility during this period of time when RNA copy numbers are 1,000,000 copies/ml or higher [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248783.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248783.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Given that RT-PCR testing can have a sensitivity or LOD as low as &lt;1,000 RNA copies/mL (1,000 NDU), there should ample performance in testing technology to leverage high-volume, high-frequency pooling, provided samples are not diluted by storage or buffering media beyond the minimum LOD when employed to detected asymptomatic but infectious individuals [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our work has a number of limitations. The SIR compartmental model provides a simplified representation of the natural history of the disease. For example, it assumes uniform mixing of the population being tested and a uniform distribution of likelihood of a positive test. The model is formulated at a population level; it does not permit the tracking of individuals. For example, we cannot incorporate the change in test sensitivity with time from infection [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In a low population prevalence, we expect a high number of false positives given assumed specificities of 99.5% and 90%. Individuals who recover from the disease are granted permanent immunity in our model, although the risk of reinfection now appears possible [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our pooling model assumed nasal or naso-pharyngeal swab samples. Because of the nature of saliva, the small sensitivity deduction assumption in our model may not be valid due to greater sample dilution [<xref rid="pone.0248783.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Finally, the model does not naturally incorporate phased, pulsed, or partial testing (1<sup>st</sup> graders on Monday, 2<sup>nd</sup> graders on Tuesday, etc.). To account for this we suggest users model the smaller groups and multiply results rather than attempt to run scenarios on the full population.</p>
              <p>Despite these limitations, sensitivity, pooling, and frequency modeling can guide institutions on best-fit testing strategies that align to their practical constraints. Organizations can apply this model to determine their best testing strategy given current community prevalence and operational and financial resources that enable sustained testing to stay safely open during the pandemic.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Berke,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>I apologize for the delay in making a decision on your manuscript. This was all due to problems in securing the required minimum number of reviewers. </p>
              <p>Please attend to all the comments and and observations made by the reviewer in addition to these I make below:</p>
              <p>1. Ensure that your referencing style conforms to that prescribed in the PLOS One guidelines.</p>
              <p>2. Provide references for the tests you mention in lines 53 to 56.</p>
              <p>3. Figure 1 title should read " Schematic representation of the model"</p>
              <p>4. Tables 2, 3 and 4 are presenting results. Should it be not appropriate that they are presented in the results section instead of results?</p>
              <p>5. Include the word "sensitivity" after the percentages in lines 62 and 63.</p>

              <p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>

              <p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: This is very good, original, and profound research work done and a well written manuscript paper. My review is therefore limited to the following minor comments only.</p>
              <p>In the supplementary material detailing the model used, under testing strategies; for effect of Symptom tracking alone, you mention that you assume 78% of cases entering a symptomatic phase are caught and a fraction b of these cases self isolate. However, in the manuscript in line 144 – 145 you mention that for the results obtained you had assumed that symptom tracking will catch 66% of symptomatic infections. Kindly clarify this disparity in percentages considered. Wouldn’t it give a substantial disparity in the simulation results obtained as well?</p>
              <p>For a population as small as the one modelled in this study (1500 subjects), a stochastic model may be more appropriate. Was this considered?</p>
              <p>As alluded to in the manuscript, asymptomatic individuals may also reach just as high detectable viral load levels for the various testing technologies. However, when it comes to infectiousness, some corner of available literature on COVI-19 and earlier communications from the United Nations suggest that the asymptomatic individuals may not be as infectious as symptomatic individuals hence their per capita rate of effective contacts I.e (β) may not be the same as for individuals with symptomatic infection. This has not been considered in the model shown in the supplementary material in 3.2 (Equations). It may not be necessary to consider this at this point but chances are that incorporating this may produce different results and this scenario may be a more accurate representation of the natural history of the infection.</p>
              <p>The “in text” referencing should be written in square brackets e.g as [14] and not as superscripts e.g as 14, 23.</p>
              <p>The sentence between lines 42 and 44 reads’ “As schools and businesses re-open and attempt to stay open, promptly detecting people with infectious COVID-19 is essential, especially as the risk of transmission is expected to increase with colder weather, more time indoors, and closer contact with others….”.</p>
              <p>My impression was that as economies open, people interact more outdoors as they are more frequently away from the indoor safety of their homes such as during lock downs. Perhaps just check that statement again on the part that says “more time indoors”.</p>
              <p>The sentence between lines 77 and 79 should read as “To compare the effects of test sensitivity and specificity, test frequency, the impact of pooling, and other key factors influencing testing strategy, we considered a classical epidemiological susceptible, infectious-asymptomatic, infectious-symptomatic, removed (SIR) compartmental model for the tested population.</p>
              <p>The sentence describing beta (β) is incomplete in the supplementary material detailing the model. It only partly says that beta is the contact rate. I believe beta can be more accurately described as the per capita rate of effective contacts.</p>
              <p>**********</p>

If published, this will include your full peer review and any attached files.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Simuunza:</p>
              <p> We appreciate the comments and suggestions of the reviewer and have incorporated their recommendations or provided alternative considerations. Below is our response to their comments in a point-by-point format, with the original reviewer comment in italics.</p>
              <p>EDITOR COMMENTS:</p>
              <p> Ensure that your referencing style conforms to that prescribed in the PLOS One guidelines.</p>
              <p>References have been updated to match PLOS One formatting guidelines. </p>
              <p> Provide references for the tests you mention in lines 53 to 56.</p>

              <p> Figure 1 title should read " Schematic representation of the model"</p>
              <p>Updated. </p>
              <p> Tables 2, 3 and 4 are presenting results. Should it be not appropriate that they are presented in the results section instead of results?</p>
              <p>There is only one table in the manuscript. We assume this refers to the figures. We have adjusted the placement of the figures so that they are in the Results section. </p>

              <p>REVIEWER COMMENTS</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: This is very good, original, and profound research work done and a well written manuscript paper. My review is therefore limited to the following minor comments only.</p>
              <p> In the supplementary material detailing the model used, under testing strategies; for effect of Symptom tracking alone, you mention that you assume 78% of cases entering a symptomatic phase are caught and a fraction b of these cases self isolate. However, in the manuscript in line 144 – 145 you mention that for the results obtained you had assumed that symptom tracking will catch 66% of symptomatic infections. Kindly clarify this disparity in percentages considered. Wouldn’t it give a substantial disparity in the simulation results obtained as well?</p>
              <p>The supplemental information has been updated to reflect the assumption that symptom tracking will catch 66% of symptomatic infections. The source of this choice is the Nature Medicine article below: </p>
              <p>C. Menni et al., “Real-time tracking of self-reported symptoms to predict potential COVID-19,” Nature Medicine, vol. 26, no. 7, Art. no. 7, Jul. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41591-020-0916-2.</p>
              <p>However, as the reviewer notes, this value certainly has an impact on the simulation results, and there is continuing discussion in the literature about the efficacy of symptom tracking. For this reason, this is an adjustable parameter in the online calculator. </p>
              <p> For a population as small as the one modelled in this study (1500 subjects), a stochastic model may be more appropriate. Was this considered?</p>
              <p>Our aim in this project was to build the simplest model we could think of that could incorporate pooling and deal with the realities of a dynamic underlying (and unknown!) community prevalence of disease. For this reason, we built the model on basic SIR-type deterministic dynamics. One of the reasons for this was to ensure that the model (and its limitations) could easily be explained to policy makers and others (school superintendents, long-term care facility administrators, parents,…). For this reason, we did not consider variations or other modeling approaches, e.g., stochastic models or agent-based approaches, that might better capture some elements of the situation. </p>
              <p> As alluded to in the manuscript, asymptomatic individuals may also reach just as high detectable viral load levels for the various testing technologies. However, when it comes to infectiousness, some corner of available literature on COVI-19 and earlier communications from the United Nations suggest that the asymptomatic individuals may not be as infectious as symptomatic individuals hence their per capita rate of effective contacts I.e (β) may not be the same as for individuals with symptomatic infection. This has not been considered in the model shown in the supplementary material in 3.2 (Equations). It may not be necessary to consider this at this point but chances are that incorporating this may produce different results and this scenario may be a more accurate representation of the natural history of the infection.</p>
              <p>It is true that the model does not incorporate a distinction in infectiousness between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. In the name of simplicity, we assume, however, asymptomatic infectious individuals are as contagious as symptomatic ones. Notably, this “stacks the deck” against any testing program one might design. Thus, this is a conservative simplifying assumption. While we certainly don’t advocate being wasteful with testing capacity, our objective was to err on the side of overbuilding testing programs. </p>
              <p> The “in text” referencing should be written in square brackets e.g as [14] and not as superscripts e.g as 14, 23.</p>
              <p>References have been updated to match PLOS One formatting guidelines. </p>
              <p> The sentence between lines 42 and 44 reads’ “As schools and businesses re-open and attempt to stay open, promptly detecting people with infectious COVID-19 is essential, especially as the risk of transmission is expected to increase with colder weather, more time indoors, and closer contact with others….”.</p>
              <p>My impression was that as economies open, people interact more outdoors as they are more frequently away from the indoor safety of their homes such as during lock downs. Perhaps just check that statement again on the part that says “more time indoors”.</p>
              <p>When this draft was originally written, during fall in the northern hemisphere, there was great concern about colder temperatures in winter leading to more indoor activities (and potentially more infections). For example, in some localities in the US, some restaurants stayed open in the fall by utilizing outdoor dining. The reviewer is correct, of course, that re-opening schools and businesses will also lead to the more contacts between individuals from distinct households. </p>
              <p>The sentence has been rewritten to read: “As schools and businesses re-open and attempt to stay open, promptly detecting people with infectious COVID-19 is essential, especially as the risk of transmission may be expected to increase as contact networks increase in size and complexity.”</p>
              <p> The sentence between lines 77 and 79 should read as “To compare the effects of test sensitivity and specificity, test frequency, the impact of pooling, and other key factors influencing testing strategy, we considered a classical epidemiological susceptible, infectious-asymptomatic, infectious-symptomatic, removed (SIR) compartmental model for the tested population.</p>
              <p>The sentence describing beta (β) is incomplete in the supplementary material detailing the model. It only partly says that beta is the contact rate. I believe beta can be more accurately described as the per capita rate of effective contacts.</p>
              <p>The description of β in the supplementary material has been updated.</p>
