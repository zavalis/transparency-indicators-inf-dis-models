              <p>The first case and the first death were reported in West Bengal (India) on March 17, 2020 and March 23, 2020, respectively.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The Government of India imposed lockdown on and from March 24, 2020 to May 31, 2020, with worldwide 20.9 million confirmed cases of SARS-Coronavirus 2 as on August 2020.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] During lockdown, only the local markets for daily consumption were open. It was, therefore, assumed that the source of transmission during this period was mainly the marketplaces, in a country like India where only 1.6% of the population has access to online shopping.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p>
              <p>Technology based on RT-PCR allows for the calculation of viral load in terms of cycle threshold values (ct values), which is normally not reported. Until now, there are few published reports, with viral loads of SARS-COV-2 in relation to severity of the disease but have only yielded conflicting results.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, there is less doubt about the relationship of transmissibility of the disease with viral loads.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p>
              <p>National Institute of Occupational Health, Ahmedabad, India, conducted a study with 138 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples out of a total of around two thousand samples collected in a district of Gujarat, India in April and May 2020, and follow up with the secondary cases. Only 7% of the SARS-COV-2-positive samples demonstrated high viral load, demonstrating these people, would on average, transmit the infection to 6.25 other people, whereas the vast majority (84%) had a low viral load, transmitting to only 0.8 person on average. Nine percent had a moderate viral load. This observation has led the investigators to propose more studies to look at the effect of isolation of these superspreaders (high and moderate viral loads) selectively on the transmission in the community.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Based on this study, this mathematical model has assumed a similar effect of viral load on transmission dynamics; other assumptions include higher mortality among elderly subjects, population density in the market places being high enough to represent the population density of the aforementioned study.</p>
              <p>The model has utilized the West Bengal COVID data[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] from March 14, 2020 to June 23, 2020, for its calibration.</p>

              <title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title>
              <p>The fundamental principle of this agent-based model is the (as yet) known virus-host interaction, with subsequent clinical consequences, which terminates with either recovery or mortality.</p>
              <p>Once the model gains acceptance with real world data, the second part begins with interventions and future prediction. On the 23<sup>rd</sup> day of unlocking, for 178 days since the date of intervention, the model has attempted interventions in four groups:</p>

              <p>Here, the model has tested its validity with the ongoing regularly published West Bengal COVID data,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] with real world data of numbers and location of markets across the state with areas showing different levels of transmission designated as Red (High), Orange (low), and Green (no transmission). Graphs [Figures <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>] comparing real world data and simulation data on daily COVID positivity and number of deaths have shown excellent congruence in terms of trend on timescale and also numerically, except a few unexplained discordance which is natural in the real world with too many unknown and transient variables which include both human and nonhuman factors. Incongruence in mortality [<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>], however, is believed to be due to the following reasons:</p>

              <p>Routine viral load testing and selective isolation of superspreaders, with the same rate of testing as on June 23, 2020 have shown increase in the number of superspreaders and this maybe because of large percentage of low viral load subjects, who have not been isolated. This large population of low viral load should induce significant numbers of superspreaders, in spite of their low infectivity, but the number drops, despite high level of detection to a level comparable with conventional strategy if testing rate is quadrupled and the reason is intensive contact tracing and strict isolation of superspreaders with highest level of vigilance. Similar effect has been observed with mortality [Figures <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>].</p>

              <p>The concept of superspreading events is a known entity and has been associated with many other infectious diseases such as typhoid, tuberculosis, measles, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, HIV, and SARS.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p>
              <p>Predicting and identifying superspreaders, therefore, offer distinct advantages in the management and preparedness of this COVID-19 pandemic. The problem lies in the paucity of adequate clinical data. Published literature on this issue reported conflicting data so far and could not establish any consistency in the relationship of viral load and severity of the disease.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p>
              <p>However, about transmissibility of the disease, especially in the community, opinions are more or less concurrent,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] although some strong opinion has been raised about heterogeneity in the standardization of testing method and human errors associated with collection and transportation of samples.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, this model has assumed perfection in the quality and reporting of the testing.</p>
              <p>As opposed to the result of our model, increasing testing rate fourfold could not contain the disease in reality, because of impracticability of tracing all the positive cases and also increasing noncompliance post lockdown. However, isolating and contact tracing only 16% of the total positive cases, that is the superspreaders is not an impractical proposition, even in a resource deprived country, and this model has demonstrated an impressive containment with this strategy, if the testing rate is increased fourfold, which is in fact the current situation, without any negative impact on mortality.</p>
              <p>At the peak of the disease load in the community, there is a very high demand for hospitalization. Unless there is a steady flow of transfer to nonisolation zone, isolation zones get quickly filled up and remain blocked with a large number of low viral load patients who could otherwise be shifted to nonisolation areas, creating vacancy in the isolation areas for treatment. This model has predictably proven that point, at all levels of testing rate. This is an exciting proposition, and a multicentric clinical study to prove the efficacy and safety of this strategy is important and a need of the hour.</p>
              <p>Weakness of this modeling study is too many assumptions which are based on relatively weak evidences.</p>
              <p>The strength of the study is that the assumptions are reasonably logical and have addressed practical issues which are critically important in the containment of a pandemic in a country with high population density, and it is validated with real world data, thus justifying correctness of the assumptions. The closest real life evidence of this model is a pilot study conducted and published by one of the authors in Ahmedabad district, where institutionalized quarantine of high viral load subjects resulted in demonstrably faster decline in active cases than rest of Gujarat.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p>

              <p>This mathematical modelling study concludes that isolating and paying special attention to only superspreaders selectively is an effective strategy in a resource-deprived overpopulated nation, provided the overall testing rate is considerably increased, particularly at the peak of transmission, when COVID isolation bed crisis is unmanageable. This justifies the merit of the strategy. However, safety of this strategy needs to be ensured by minimizing heterogeneity and subjectivity in the entire process of testing methodology, requiring more vigilance, and raising the urgent need for more clinical, population as well as biotechnology-based research. This is the shortcomings or demerits of viral load testing strategy at the current level of understanding.</p>
