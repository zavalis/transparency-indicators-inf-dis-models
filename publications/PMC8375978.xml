                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has induced unprecedented reductions in human mobility and social contacts throughout the world. Because dengue virus (DENV) transmission is strongly driven by human mobility, behavioral changes associated with the pandemic have been hypothesized to impact dengue incidence. By discouraging human contact, COVID-19 control measures have also disrupted dengue vector control interventions, the most effective of which require entry into homes. We sought to investigate how and why dengue incidence could differ under a lockdown scenario with a proportion of the population sheltered at home.</p>

                  <title>Methodology &amp; principal findings</title>
                  <p>We used an agent-based model with a realistic treatment of human mobility and vector control. We found that a lockdown in which 70% of the population sheltered at home and which occurred in a season when a new serotype invaded could lead to a small average increase in cumulative DENV infections of up to 10%, depending on the time of year lockdown occurred. Lockdown had a more pronounced effect on the spatial distribution of DENV infections, with higher incidence under lockdown in regions with higher mosquito abundance. Transmission was also more focused in homes following lockdown. The proportion of people infected in their own home rose from 54% under normal conditions to 66% under lockdown, and the household secondary attack rate rose from 0.109 to 0.128, a 17% increase. When we considered that lockdown measures could disrupt regular, city-wide vector control campaigns, the increase in incidence was more pronounced than with lockdown alone, especially if lockdown occurred at the optimal time for vector control.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions &amp; significance</title>
                  <p>Our results indicate that an unintended outcome of lockdown measures may be to adversely alter the epidemiology of dengue. This observation has important implications for an improved understanding of dengue epidemiology and effective application of dengue vector control. When coordinating public health responses during a syndemic, it is important to monitor multiple infections and understand that an intervention against one disease may exacerbate another.</p>

                <title>Author summary</title>
                <p>Dengue virus causes substantial suffering in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, with roughly 400 million infections and 40,000 deaths each year. In 2020, we witnessed unprecedented changes in human movement as the world tried to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, including in countries that regularly experience dengue epidemics, such as Thailand and Peru. These changes could affect transmission of dengue virus, though it is unclear whether transmission will decrease, as people reduce their movements between houses, or increase, as people spend more time at home and campaigns to control the mosquito vector of dengue virus are interrupted. We used a simulation model to estimate the impact of these changes on dengue virus transmission. Our model describes the locations of buildings and the movement of people between them, allowing us to directly estimate what happens when human movement patterns change. We found that as people spend more time at home, transmission is likely to increase moderately. If these changes also lead to disruption to vector control, the magnitude of the increase is greater. Our results reinforce concerns about the complexity of public health responses to multiple overlapping epidemics and support the need for policy makers and health authorities to think holistically in their intervention planning.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Interventions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic have had unprecedented effects on the lives of people around the world. While measures like social distancing and stay-at-home orders have been successful in reducing transmission, morbidity, and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], they are likely to have also had an effect on the incidence of other diseases. For example, lockdown measures are predicted to increase the burden of tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria by reducing access to essential services [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease endemic across much of the tropics, with an estimated 400 million infections and 40,000 deaths each year [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A number of countries with particularly severe COVID-19 epidemics regularly experience dengue epidemics (e.g., Peru, Brazil, and Indonesia), and there have been reports of 2020 being an above-average year for dengue in South America [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A number of warnings have been raised regarding the potential dangers of overlapping dengue and COVID-19 epidemics; e.g., both diseases can result in similar symptoms and there have been reports of serological cross-reaction, which increases the chance of misdiagnosis [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. At least five cases of dengue-COVID-19 co-infection have been reported, one of which resulted in death by stroke [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Some researchers have raised concerns about the possible impact of interrupted vector control campaigns and called for efforts to overcome this adverse impact [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>Dengue virus (DENV) transmission is influenced by multiple overlapping drivers, including human and mosquito movement; climate and environmental factors that affect mosquito abundance, contact with human hosts, and vector-virus interactions; human host immunity; and virus genotype [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Hence, predicting the epidemiological impact of drastic changes in human mobility on DENV transmission is difficult because of the large number of other potentially influential variables that interact in complex ways. It is understood that daily routine movement between houses is a key driver of DENV transmission, and it is this type of movement that has been most affected by COVID-19 lockdown measures [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While on the one hand reductions in house-to-house movements could be expected to reduce DENV transmission, on the other hand increased opportunities for intra-household transmission coupled with local mosquito movement and imperfect compliance with lockdown could heighten transmission. Hence, it is unclear in which direction transmission will change in response to lockdown.</p>
              <p>We used an established, agent-based model of DENV transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to explore the impact of lockdown on dengue incidence. Our model incorporates a detailed, realistic, and spatially explicit representation of human mobility and spatiotemporal patterns of mosquito abundance. It is calibrated to dengue incidence in the city of Iquitos, Peru, and has been previously used to answer a number of questions of public health significance beyond that specific setting [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, we compared the effects of initiating lockdown in different DENV transmission seasons and at different times within a transmission season. Rather than seeking to model the actual patterns of dengue in Iquitos in 2020, our study uses reconstructions of past dengue seasons, and asks the hypothetical question of what these seasons would have looked like with changes in mobility similar to those we might expect under lockdown, or with disrupted vector control campaigns. This enables us to isolate the effect of those modifications and to present general principles from our assessments. We focused on lockdown effects on (1) the incidence and spatial distribution of DENV infections, (2) local transmission by calculating household secondary attack rates, and (3) disrupted vector control campaigns. Our approach yields predictions for how lockdown could affect dengue and the mechanisms by which it could do so.</p>

                <title>Model overview</title>
                <p>A detailed explanation of all features of the model is given in the <xref rid="pntd.0009603.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref> and previous publications [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In brief, we used an established agent-based model of DENV transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], with a detailed and realistic model of human movement [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], to explore how preventive measures taken against COVID-19 could affect DENV transmission. Our model is based on the city of Iquitos, in the Peruvian Amazon. Human agents in the model move around the city according to individualized movement trajectories, calibrated to data on movement patterns in Iquitos from semi-structured resident interviews [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The average distribution of mosquito agents in the model follows spatio-temporal estimates of abundance based on household entomological surveys [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The distribution of household sizes matches the demography observed in population surveys [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Mosquito agents also move, but much less than human agents. Each mosquito determines when to bite based on a temperature dependent gonotrophic rate parameter, and who to bite based on the body sizes of humans present at that time (see <xref rid="pntd.0009603.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref> for more details). Transmission occurs between mosquito and human agents when one agent (either mosquito or human) is susceptible and the other infectious, a blood-meal is taken by the mosquito, and the infection establishes in the susceptible agent, which occurs with a fixed probability. Transmission in the model is partially driven by time series of imported infections, which were calibrated to estimates of the time-varying, serotype-specific force of infection over an 11-year time period (<xref rid="pntd.0009603.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). See Fig in Perkins <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. and <xref rid="pntd.0009603.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> in Cavany <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. for a visual representation of the calibration [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We do not alter these importation patterns between simulations. In reality, importation patterns almost certainly decreased during lockdown. However, we used baseline importation patterns because epidemic timing in our model is driven by the importation time series. Moreover, our aim was to isolate the effects of mobility changes and disruptions in vector control, and for these aims the baseline importation patterns served as a valid baseline. Other differences between what actually happened in Iquitos and our simulated scenarios likely include the length and level of compliance with lockdown–these differences are discussed in more detail in the Discussion.</p>

                <title>Simulations</title>
                <p>To understand the impact that lockdown could have on dengue, we simulated historical transmission under typical movement patterns and those that might be expected under lockdown. We defined lockdown as 70% of the population staying at home instead of undertaking their typical movement trajectory for that day. That is, 30% of individuals do not comply with lockdown, either because they choose not to or because they have an essential job. We explored different values of compliance in a sensitivity analysis. We chose three representative seasons from empirical data for the period 2000–2010 that span a range of seasonal dynamics, including a season with low incidence (2004–2005, “low” hereafter), a season with high incidence but no new serotype invasion (2000–2001, “high” hereafter), and a season with high incidence due to a new serotype invasion (2001–2002, invasion of DENV-3, “serotype invasion” hereafter) (<xref rid="pntd.0009603.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Seasons were defined to begin on July 1 and end on June 30 [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In each of these scenarios, we initiated lockdown on the first of each month to explore the effect of initiating lockdown at different times of year. (<xref rid="pntd.0009603.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). For our baseline setting, we simulated lockdowns lasting for three months, though we also explored different values of this timespan in a second sensitivity analysis. We explored starting lockdown in different months to understand how lockdown interplays with the seasonality of dengue. Except where stated otherwise, we started lockdown on March 17, which was the date lockdown began during 2020 in Peru. This showed a moderate effect in the serotype invasion season. We simulated vector control as a city-wide campaign in which all houses that complied (70%) were sprayed three times in a three-week period; approximately 11,000 houses per day. In baseline simulations and for the calibration, vector control did not take place. The ultra-low volume insecticide treatment had no residuality and increased the mortality rate of mosquitoes in the household by 1.5 day<sup>-1</sup> on the day when spraying occurred [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We ran each simulation 400 times, because increasing the number of simulations past that point did not reduce the coefficient of variation in the number of DENV infections by more than 0.1% [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p>For each scenario, we analyzed the distribution across simulations of the number of human DENV infections in the transmission seasons including and immediately following the initiation of lockdown, and compared this to the same period in simulations without lockdown.

                <p>The movement trajectories are calculated prior to simulating the agent-based models, and are then used as inputs to the model. By comparing the movement trajectories directly, i.e. without simulating the model, we analyzed the effect of changing these trajectories so that people spend all of their time at home. We quantified this impact by calculating the number of locations where the average number of people present was greater under lockdown These outcomes are based purely on the modified activity spaces of individuals in the model, without directly simulating movement or transmission, and are presented in the “Changing distributions of people and blood-meals section.”</p>
                <p>We undertook three sensitivity analyses: varying lockdown compliance, lockdown length, and mosquito movement probability. In all three cases, we swept across 2,000 parameter values, calculated the cumulative number of infections across two seasons, and fitted a generalized additive model (GAM) to the output using the mgcv package in R [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>

                <title>Effect of lockdown timing on dengue incidence</title>
                <p>The effect of the month in which lockdown was initiated varied across scenarios (Figs <xref rid="pntd.0009603.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0009603.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009603.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). In the low and high scenarios, lockdown had little effect on the incidence of DENV infection; i.e. the timing of lockdown was not important (<xref rid="pntd.0009603.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). In the serotype invasion scenario, the timing of lockdown was much more important. Initiating lockdown early in the season (July–October) led to similar local two-year cumulative incidence of infections as the no-lockdown scenario; e.g., initiating in July led to 130,434 infections (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 122,674–150,995), a 0.2% decrease (Figs <xref rid="pntd.0009603.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0009603.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). Conversely, initiating lockdown just after the seasonal peak in infections (June) led to many more infections; e.g., 144,668 infections (95% UI: 136,812–162,403) over two years, an 11% increase. This part of the season follows the period of highest incidence, when prevalence and force of infection are at their highest.</p>

                <title>Spatial and locational effects of lockdown</title>
                <p>When we initiated a three-month lockdown in mid-March in the serotype invasion scenario, lockdown changed the spatial distribution of infections; i.e. the home of the person infected (<xref rid="pntd.0009603.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Mid-March was chosen because that is when COVID-19 mobility restrictions were put in place in 2020 and because we observed a moderate effect of lockdown initiated in March in the serotype invasion scenario (<xref rid="pntd.0009603.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). In 20 of 35 Ministry of Health zones, infections rose, with the greatest increases in the northeast and southwest of the city. Notably, the zones with the greatest increases were those zones with the highest average <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> abundance. Those with a decrease had the lowest average <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> abundance (Pearson’s correlation, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.946 (95% UI: 0.923, 0.955)). The correlation between cumulative incidence and average mosquito abundance was <italic toggle="yes">r =</italic> 0.925 (95% UI: 0.893, 0.938) when no lockdown occurred, compared to <italic toggle="yes">r =</italic> 0.946 with lockdown. This indicates that spatial abundance of mosquitoes may have a slightly stronger effect on dengue incidence when human mobility is reduced. Neither human population density (<italic toggle="yes">r =</italic> - 0.344) nor changes in the total number of person-days spent in each zone (<italic toggle="yes">r =</italic> 0.056) were strongly correlated with changes in incidence.</p>

                <p>While some zones where people spend more time under lockdown were those where there was also greater mosquito abundance (e.g., in the northeast), other zones with high mosquito abundance saw reductions in the amount of time spent there (e.g., in the southwest) (<xref rid="pntd.0009603.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B and 3D</xref>). Notably, these southwest zones saw increases in incidence despite, in most cases, fewer person-days being spent there (<xref rid="pntd.0009603.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3D</xref>). This is due to the fact that while fewer people were visiting this region, resulting in an overall decrease in person-hours, the people who live in this region were spending more time in homes with relatively high mosquito abundance.</p>
                <p>The type of location where infections took place noticeably changed under lockdown. In the baseline scenario, 54.5% (95% UI: 54.3%– 55.0%) of infections occurred in the home of the infected individual. In contrast, when a lockdown occurred in mid-March in the serotype invasion season, 66.3% (95% UI: 58.9%– 70.2%) of infections occurred in the infected person’s home. This had an effect on the household secondary attack rate, which increased from a mean of 0.109 (95% UI: 0.0999, 0.126) in the baseline scenario to 0.128 (95% UI: 0.119, 0.146) in the lockdown scenario, a 17% increase. In our model, lockdown had a negligible impact on the total number of mosquito bites on humans because the time when mosquitoes take blood-meals is determined by the temperature-driven gonotrophic cycle period, not the number of humans present.</p>

                <title>Changing distributions of people and blood-meals</title>
                <p>According to the most recent available information from reports of past city-wide spraying campaigns (which are not publicly available), there are 92,896 buildings in Iquitos [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (Amy Morrison &amp; Helvio Astete, <italic toggle="yes">personal communication</italic>). Comparing typical patterns of human mobility in Iquitos with those under lockdown (assuming each person spends more time at home), we would expect 78,562 (85%) buildings to have more people inside them during lockdown. Every location that was expected to have more people under lockdown was a residential location, while all non-residential locations had fewer people, on average, under lockdown. There were 9,761 residential locations (11% of all 88,323 residential locations) that had a lower average number of people under lockdown.</p>
                <p>Model simulations in the absence of vector control showed that the number of unique individuals bitten by a single mosquito increased under lockdown. In the serotype invasion scenario with a three-month lockdown beginning in mid-March, the number of unique individuals each mosquito bit in its lifetime rose from 2.54 to 2.64 (3.9%). In all three scenarios, the number of unique bites rose by 0.09–0.10 bites. This increase in the number of unique bites was due to heterogeneity in the number of people per location. In the baseline scenario, the Gini coefficient of the number of people in each house was 0.635, whereas under lockdown it was 0.402. As a smaller Gini coefficient implies greater homogeneity, this suggests that the number of people per house was more homogeneous under lockdown. In turn, this implies that in the baseline scenario there was more heterogeneity in the number of unique individuals available for each mosquito to bite, resulting in fewer bites on unique individuals on average.</p>

                <title>Importance of vector control</title>
                <p>In addition to the effects of lockdown on incidence caused by changes in mosquito-human encounters, lockdown can affect incidence by disrupting vector control. If an early-season vector-control campaign (July or August) was interrupted by public health measures against COVID-19, the impact of lockdown and the interrupted campaign was small, but still more than double the incidence of infection immediately following lockdown (Figs <xref rid="pntd.0009603.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0009603.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>, Jul and Aug panels). If the lockdown instead took place just prior to the seasonal peak (e.g., March), this led to a large increase in the size of the epidemic by a factor of greater than 10 at the peak of the season (Figs <xref rid="pntd.0009603.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0009603.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>, Mar panels). In the alternative scenario in which vector control proceeded as planned during lockdown, there was a large rebound in infections the following season, due to low population immunity. That rebound could be mitigated partially by a delayed campaign following lockdown, or a city-wide campaign in the subsequent year (<xref rid="pntd.0009603.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009603.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref> Figs).</p>

                <title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
                <p>In all baseline analyses, we used values of 70% compliance with lockdown orders and a lockdown length of three months. We explored changing these values in a one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis in the serotype invasion season beginning lockdown in mid-March (<xref rid="pntd.0009603.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009603.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">10</xref> Figs). Compliance had a non-linear, non-monotonic relationship with the cumulative number of infections (<xref rid="pntd.0009603.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>). The cumulative number of infections peaked at slightly below 90% compliance. This indicates that while lockdown tends to increase DENV incidence, the optimal conditions for transmission require some amount of human mobility. Even if compliance were 100%, however, our results indicate that incidence would still rise compared to typical movement patterns. Longer lockdowns appeared to increase cumulative DENV incidence, though this effect saturated at around 150 days (<xref rid="pntd.0009603.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>).</p>
                <p>Because human mobility was severely curtailed during lockdown and mosquito distribution patterns were correlated with changes in DENV incidence, the role of mosquito movement in transmission may have been heightened in our model. We explored this by varying the daily probability of mosquito movement in simulations with and without lockdown (<xref rid="pntd.0009603.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Irrespective of whether lockdown occurred, incidence peaked when the daily probability of mosquitoes moving from a house was around 0.2; i.e. each day, each mosquito moves to a new house with probability 0.2. Regardless of lockdown, there was no transmission when mosquitoes did not move between houses, because house-level mosquito extinctions could not be replenished. As mosquito movement increased, so did the proportional change in the number of infections in lockdown compared to no lockdown (<xref rid="pntd.0009603.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). This indicates that the role of mosquito movement is heightened under lockdown. If its role were the same in both situations, we would expect this ratio to remain at 1 across the range of mosquito movement probabilities.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We found that lockdown movement restrictions led to an increase in DENV transmission in our model output, if these restrictions occurred during a season in which incidence was high due to a new serotype invasion. Though the increase was relatively modest, the effect was most pronounced when lockdown occurred during periods of time when the prevalence of infection, and hence the force of infection, was highest. In this study, that scenario occurred at the end of a novel serotype invasion season, following several months of heightened transmission. Lockdown had a more pronounced effect in changing the locations where transmission occurred and the spatial distribution of infections. Specifically, more infections occurred in people’s homes than at other types of locations, which increased the household secondary attack rate by 17%. This meant that more infections occurred where mosquito abundance was highest, amplifying hyperlocal transmission due to incomplete compliance with lockdown and mosquito movement among nearby houses. Mosquito movement between houses seems particularly important to enable some inter-household transmission in the context of reduced human mobility. If mosquitoes moved less, the effect of lockdown would in fact be to reduce transmission overall. When we considered the effect of potential interruptions to vector control, lockdown led to much greater increases in DENV transmission.</p>
              <p>Our results identified three factors contributing to the direct effect of lockdown on DENV transmission apart from interruption of vector control. First, lockdown causes infections to become more concentrated in locations where mosquito abundance is highest, facilitating more transmission than might occur otherwise. Second, people spending more time at home causes an increase in the household secondary attack rate. Under non-lockdown circumstances, uninfected household members spend more time outside the home and thereby reduce their exposure. Third, lockdown results in a more homogeneous distribution of person-hours across locations, which leads to an increase in the number of unique individuals that each mosquito bites because there are fewer mosquitoes with no-one to bite and many mosquitoes have more options of who to bite. This increases the chance that a mosquito becomes infected within its lifetime, as well as the chance that a mosquito gets infected by one person and later bites and infects a different person.</p>
              <p>These direct effects of lockdown are likely to be greatest in settings where transmission predominantly occurs in homes and where household-level mosquito abundance is typically high. In Iquitos, this assumption is supported both by pupal surveys of <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes in non-residential locations [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and epidemiological investigations of contact-site clusters [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Rather than to model the interaction between COVID-19 and dengue as it unfolded in Iquitos, however, our goal was to use a model previously developed for Iquitos to address a general question about the effect of lockdown on dengue. We used hypothetical scenarios with altered mobility patterns and vector control campaigns, which were not intended to directly represent the reality of what happened in Iquitos or any other city in 2020, but to gain mechanistic understanding of the effect of these type of mobility changes. Even so, it is worth noting that Iquitos did experience a large COVID-19 epidemic beginning in March 2020, which severely strained health services there [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Just before then, the city experienced a relatively large dengue epidemic in December 2019 through March 2020 [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Extensive disruption of health services thereafter for illnesses other than COVID-19 makes it difficult to know what the course of that dengue epidemic was once COVID-19 arrived [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Given how large the COVID-19 epidemic in Iquitos appears to have been [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], compliance with lockdown there may have been low. On the other hand, Google mobility data from Maynas province shows a 30% increase from baseline in household mobility and a 60% decrease from baseline in workplace mobility during April and May, suggesting substantial changes in mobility patterns [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Although low compliance with lockdown would reduce the direct effects of lockdown on dengue that we demonstrated with our model, reductions to vector control services may have had effects on dengue incidence that went unnoticed by surveillance and that could have implications for the next dengue transmission season. If we were to use our model to attempt to reconstruct what actually happened in Iquitos, we need data from serological surveys and mosquito household surveys from 2010 up to 2021, alongside detailed mobility data for the city. Once these former data become available, such a study could prove a valuable contribution.</p>
              <p>Globally, there have been reports of both rising [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and falling [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] dengue incidence since the COVID-19 pandemic began [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. A study from Thailand was able to associate increases in dengue incidence with interventions against COVID-19 [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], consistent with our findings. The observational nature of that study did not allow for the mechanisms behind that association to be understood, but the authors hypothesized that it may have been due to heightened exposure to vectors while people spent more time in their homes [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Our analysis adds value by testing that hypothesis through simulation experiments and elucidating how the strength of those effects is modulated by other factors, such as spatial heterogeneity in mosquito abundance, the spatial scale of mosquito movement, compliance with lockdown, and the seasonal timing of lockdown. Our study is also inline with a statistical analysis from Brazil finding a positive association of mobility restrictions with dengue cases 20 days later [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and is similar to the finding that reductions in mobility due to the effects of fever can increase transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Conversely, a study from Sri Lanka found a decreased risk of dengue during lockdown [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>
              <p>A factor that could be important in modulating effects of lockdown on dengue is the extent to which DENV transmission occurs at other types of locations, such as schools [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In settings where schools or other non-residential locations are important for DENV transmission, lockdown measures could have a qualitatively different effect by reducing the number of people in those high-risk locations. Nonetheless, homes and their vicinity remain a key site of transmission in many settings, and we expect that our finding that lockdown further increases transmission in such locations will be robust [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Spatio-temporal heterogeneity in compliance with lockdown may also impact dengue transmission. While we modeled some heterogeneity by randomly choosing who will comply with lockdown, there is no spatial or temporal structure to this aspect of our approach. If certain districts within a city have lower compliance with lockdown, there may be a reduced effect of lockdown in those districts.</p>
              <p>The scale of the non-pharmaceutical interventions undertaken to combat the COVID-19 epidemic have likely impacted a number of other diseases, either directly or indirectly. Some of these effects may be positive. For instance, due to the shared route of transmission, interventions against COVID-19 impact influenza in a similar way, and likely contributed to very low flu seasons during the Southern Hemisphere winter and in Hong Kong [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. On the other hand, disruption of key services and reductions in care-seeking behavior are projected to have negative effects on the burden of TB, malaria, HIV/AIDS, and a range of vaccine-preventable diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Our results align more closely with the latter pattern, showing a potentially large negative effect if dengue vector control campaigns are interrupted. To mitigate this, public health authorities could encourage or assist people to spray their own homes, by providing them with self-use insecticide treatments [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. This would mitigate the impact of reduced vector control activities and reduce the impact of changes in mobility on dengue transmission.</p>
              <p>A significant strength of our study is our spatially explicit treatment of human mobility, which allowed us to isolate the effect of lockdown in ways that a simpler model could not. Moreover, our model’s direct inclusion of mosquito movement and individual biting behavior allowed us to understand the changing role of these factors in DENV transmission when movement restrictions were imposed. Our study also has at least five limitations. First, it is difficult to know the exact response people made to lockdown measures, such as the level of compliance and how the nature of their movements changed. Our sensitivity analysis of lockdown compliance and duration found that reduced compliance linearly decreased the change in incidence due to lockdown. Second, we assumed that mosquito behavior was unaffected by changes in human mobility. Lockdown has been associated with increased vector indices in India [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Third, we did not assess the impact of changing DENV importation patterns into Iquitos. Because our model predicts the biggest impact of lockdown is late in the season, a time when the epidemic is predominantly driven by local transmission, we would not expect changes in imported infections to qualitatively affect this result. Changing importations may, however, have a significant impact if they prevent an imported infection from seeding a new outbreak, particularly if the introduced virus was a new serotype. Fourth, we did not assess impact in terms of severe disease; e.g., dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). We made this decision because of severe dengue’s dependence on the local immunity profile and circulating serotype, which would mean DHF results would be difficult to generalize. Our model was also calibrated to a statistical reconstruction of incidence of infection [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] rather than disease. Nonetheless, increased incidence of DENV infection would, all else being equal, be expected to translate to higher rates of severe disease; a very concerning situation in the context of already strained health systems due to COVID-19. Fifth, in order to simplify the analysis we did not incorporate structured spatial heterogeneity in compliance. While we do model heterogeneity in compliance between individuals, structured differences between regions may lead to effects not captured in our analysis.</p>
              <p>Our findings illustrate why, during a syndemic, public health officials must consider the implications of an action to prevent one disease on other concurrent diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Thus, a holistic approach to infectious disease mitigation is needed. Research and policy efforts should focus on ways to retain the positive effects of lockdown on diseases like COVID-19, influenza, and pneumonia while mitigating the negative effects on dengue, malaria, and TB. Vector control activities which people can do themselves in their own homes, such handheld over-the-counter insecticide treatments, should be encouraged and supported during lockdown. Whenever there is risk of DENV transmission, efforts must be made to avoid disrupting effective control practises and provide carefully planned alternative means of making interventions possible. More communication, creativity, and inter-sectorial collaboration will be needed to ensure the continuation of meaningful interventions than to rely solely on providing vector control staff with personal protective equipment to carry out existing forms of control [<xref rid="pntd.0009603.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>

              <p>Editors' comments:</p>
              <p>I have read the comments and would ask that you pay particular attention to justifying the timing of the lockdown, as well as provide justification/ referencing for some of the parameter values. Additionally, the language in the discussion should be softened the reflect the assumptions and repercussions thereof of the model.</p>
              <p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Key Review Criteria Required for Acceptance?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>As you describe the new analyses required for acceptance, please consider the following:</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Methods</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated?</p>
              <p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p>
              <p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p>
              <p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Generally the objectives and methods are clear. A few questions below:</p>
              <p>1. lines 103-104 How could this calibration effect the results of this study? for example, have movement within and into Iquitos and/or populations, buildings, etc. change significantly since the early 2000/s, especially during the pandemic? How would this affect the outcomes?</p>
              <p>2. lines 108-109 Does this mean you are assuming that 30% of the people have essential jobs? Or that 70% of the people without essential jobs are staying home? Also, this doesn't necessarily need to be included in this study, but it are the essential workers more likely to come from certain parts of the city or higher incidence neighborhoods?</p>
              <p>3. lines 121-123 It's not always clear when vector control is applied versus not. For example, did the original calibration include vector control? </p>
              <p>4. Figure 1, is there a comparison with the reported case counts and the simulated data?</p>
              <p>5. Line 144 What does "without simulating the full model" mean?</p>
              <p>6. Line 148 why is the unique number of visitors greater under lockdown? wouldn't there be the same household members at home without extra people visiting?</p>
              <p>7. Line 152 I assume that "compliance" is referring to lockdown and not the vector control compliance referenced earlier?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The hypothesis of the study is clear and the study design is appropiate.</p>
              <p>Methodology is appropiate but it is necessary to search for other papers to fully understand it.</p>
              <p>Minor comment: In the line 98-99 is stated that “Each mosquito determines when to bite based on a temperature dependent rate parameter”, I would like to know how other variables that are known to influence feeding like gonotrophic cycle or body size are involved in this part. It is also not very clear in the supplementary material.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: See general comments. Major issues with study design</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Results</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p>
              <p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The results match and presentation is generally clear. A few questions below.</p>
              <p>1. Lines 163-164 Interesting that one month difference in timing makes such a big difference in results. Is this June lockdown referred to here a month before the July lockdown or 11 months later in the simulation? I guess more specifically, is it right before the introduction of a new serotype or 11 months after? From looking at the first figure, June is normally low incidence but happened to be particularly high because of the timing of the serotype invasion that season which allowed transmission even during a normally lower mosquito density because of the high susceptibility of the human hosts. So it's not so much the particular month as it is whether or not the lockdown is happening when incidence is over some kind of high threshold. Is that a correct interpretation?</p>
              <p>2. Figure 2 says you are including two years worth of incidence in the plot but this wasn't clear from the Methods section or in other descriptions--whether or not you are considering the one season or multiple in the results.</p>
              <p>3. Line 173 "spatial distribution" Are you referring to the location where infectious bite occurred or the home of the person infected? (This applies to the spatial maps of infection as well)</p>
              <p>4. Lines 186-189 Not sure that it makes sense to have higher incidence with fewer people-hours. More explanation would be helpful. Were incidence increases were in people residing there? Or people infected while visiting there?</p>
              <p>5. Lines 208-214 These numbers are confusing. It says 78,562 buildings have more people inside them but then says 9,761 residential locations had higher numbers of people during lockdown</p>
              <p>6. Lines 217-225 It's not clear when vector control is occurring or not in these descriptions.</p>
              <p>7. Figure 5. How does the movement rate determined in the original calibration compare to the numbers shown in the plot? is there reason to think that mosquito movement increased or is this more of a "what-if" scenario?</p>
              <p>8. Lines 293-295 Why does more homogeneity result in fewer unique bites? This seems counter-intuitive</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Results do match analysis plan.</p>
              <p>Some comments: </p>
              <p>Lines 179-181: “The correlation between cumulative incidence and average mosquito abundance was r = 0.925 when no lockdown occurred, compared to r = 0.946 with lockdown. This indicates that spatial abundance of mosquitoes becomes a stronger determinant of dengue incidence when human mobility is reduced.” It doesn’t seems enough difference to indicate the latter statement.</p>
              <p>I suggest to include values related to statistical significance when spearman correlation coefficient is indicated (p-value for example). Correlation coefficient indicates strength and direction of the correlation but it is not necessarily statistically significant.</p>
              <p>Line 213: it is not clear where the value of “11% of all residential locations” comes from. Seems a little lower which, in turn, can tend to underestimate the blood-meal estimates.</p>

                <bold>Conclusions</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p>
              <p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?</p>
              <p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The conclusions are robust and testable by data in the future. The limitations are stated in the manuscript and the effects of COVID-19 mitigations on other infectious diseases are of interest to a wide range of researchers and of high public health relevance.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Conclusions are well supported. Strengths and limitations are well described.</p>
              <p>I suggest a better and more complete explanation about why there is a markedly increase in infections at homes. It is understood that people spend more time at homes but still it is important the movement of people for the arrival of the virus into the house. There are reports where staying at home during the day was protective against the disease (for example Cordeiro, R., Donalisio, M.R., Andrade, V.R. et al. Spatial distribution of the risk of dengue fever in southeast Brazil, 2006-2007. BMC Public Health 11, 355 (2011). <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-11-355" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-11-355</ext-link>). This is also important at the light of poor explanation about changes of mosquito behavior.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The conclusions will need to updated after major revisions of the study design. See general comments below</p>

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This is a good piece of work explaining how current issues influence old issues. It is well written and the most speculative part (such as the amount of compliance of the lockdown) are well addressed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This study seeks to understand the impact of the COVI-19 pandemic on dengue transmission. This is a scenario based study looking at the the impact of lockdown via decrese human mobility have on DENV burden. This is timely and a major short/ long term concern in a pandemic context. However I have major concerns with the syudy design and thus the uselfullness of the simulations presented. </p>
              <p>Specific comments:</p>
              <p>Why simulate 70% lockdown as ad hoc? Even though you do sensitivity analysis around this value, Are the reduction in movement realistic reductions? Why not use data driven reductions? Also we know that individual response to lockdown is heterogenous. It would be good to see actual movement data for the region used, these data while not easily available before the pandemic, are now widely available (eg., facebook mobility data, Apple, google). Reference 30 is from 2014 as such would only serve as baseline movement pre pandemic. These crude homogenous decreases end up being over -under estimations of the actuall patterns of movement. </p>
              <p>In Peru About 70% of the employed population work in the informal sector, which is one of the highest rates in Latin America. These jobs are by their nature unpredictable and often in environments making social distancing difficult. Peruvians who went out to work had to use public transport, and to sell goods in very crowded markets. Even during lockdown. So your 70% baseline compliance seems to be a gross over estimation. </p>
              <p>The latest National Household Survey suggests 11.8% of poor households in Peru live in overcrowded homes. So I wonder if your household transmission may nee dto be reasssed?</p>
              <p>Is there evidence for the decreased vector control scenario? When we considered that lockdown measures could disrupt regular, city-wide vector control campaigns, the increase in incidence was more pronounced than with lockdown alone, especially if lockdown occurred at the optimal time for vector control.</p>
              <p>I don’t understand the point of this scenario: Initiating lockdown early in the season (July – October) what July is this? July 2020? They started lockdown in March that lasted until June. This scenario makes no sense. If it is July 2019 makes even less sense. </p>
              <p>Also heterogeneous startegies between regions in Peru outside of iquitos? Why not add a few mor regions?</p>
              <p> Also wouldn’t stay at home scanerios be accompanied by increased portectionin the homes? Why assume nothing changes?</p>
              <p>If there is evidence of reduction on vector control campains (I dindt find any) Should perhaps instead of a all or none control campaign, a spectrum of coverage be explored?</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Cavany,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "The impacts of COVID-19 mitigation on dengue virus transmission: a modeling study" for consideration at PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. As with all papers reviewed by the journal, your manuscript was reviewed by members of the editorial board and by several independent reviewers. The reviewers appreciated the attention to an important topic. Based on the reviews, we are likely to accept this manuscript for publication, providing that you modify the manuscript according to the review recommendations. </p>
              <p>Hello, in addition to the reviewers, both handling editors have reviewed the manuscript, comments, and revisions. We feel that the manuscript is meritorious, but there is still some minor comments to address. Specifically, we would suggest that it be explicitly stated in both the introduction and discussion that while the manuscript is informed by Iquitos data, this is a generalized look at hypotheticals. We further suggest that major differences in the modeled scenarios vs. what actually happened in Iquitos be addressed somewhere in the manuscript. - RCC</p>
              <p>Please consider modifying the title so as not to overstate the association with COVID-19, explicitly, but rather to reflect that the model assesses a hypothetical lockdown scenario (e.g., in response to the COVID-19 pandemic). - JVC</p>
              <p>Please prepare and submit your revised manuscript within 30 days. If you anticipate any delay, please let us know the expected resubmission date by replying to this email. </p>
              <p>When you are ready to resubmit, please upload the following:</p>
              <p>[1] A letter containing a detailed list of your responses to all review comments, and a description of the changes you have made in the manuscript. </p>
              <p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out</p>
              <p>[2] Two versions of the revised manuscript: one with either highlights or tracked changes denoting where the text has been changed; the other a clean version (uploaded as the manuscript file).</p>
              <p>Important additional instructions are given below your reviewer comments. </p>
              <p>Thank you again for your submission to our journal. We hope that our editorial process has been constructive so far, and we welcome your feedback at any time. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or comments.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>
              <p>Rebecca C Christofferson</p>

              <p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated?</p>
              <p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p>
              <p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p>
              <p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: addressed my questions and methods adhere to criteria</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The hypothesis is clear and the study design are adequated. </p>
              <p>It is evident that the city of Iquitos is well known and that has been characterized for long time. This can be seen through the developed model on this city. It is necessary to read other papers to fully understand the model, but the focus of the paper is not the development of the model, so it is not a big problem.</p>

              <p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p>
              <p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?</p>
              <p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: yes to all criteria</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Conclusions are well supported. Strengths and limitations are well described.</p>
              <p>Just a little concern: Most of simulations were done on the “serotype invasion” season, which were the one where lockdown had an effect on incidence. There is no evidence that a serotype invaded Iquitos during the 2020 (or it is not stated in the manuscript). </p>
              <p>At the end of the manuscript, the idea that lockdown has an effect on dengue incidence remains. So, conclusions must specify that the effects seen on most of simulations along this study apply in that especific season. For the other two scenarios, probably the most likely to have occurred, no effect was seen due to lockdown, according to the first simulations (and Fig 1). I know that in each experiment it is stated the season where experiments were runned, but I would like to suggest that be sure that correct idea remains at the end of the document.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors did a good job of addressing my questions and comments.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This is a good piece of work and is well written. It is appropriate for the current times and the situation. It is a well use of a previously developed model.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The authors study the impact of COVID-19 measure on dengue transmission using an ABM with mobility and vector control. </p>
              <p>While the simulation study is potentially interesting, I still have major issues with the assumptions in the model particularly the choices for lockdown stringency and duration.</p>
              <p>Below I make more specific comments on my issues.</p>
              <p>Assumptions of the model</p>
              <p>I still have major issues with the methodology under the lockdown.</p>
              <p>The authors mention that “Transmission in the model is partially driven by time series of imported infections, which were calibrated to estimates of the time-varying, serotype-specific force of infection over an 11-year time period.” Is this still valid in the lockdown?</p>
              <p>“See Fig 3 in Perkins et al. and S1 Fig in Cavany et al. for a visual representation of the calibration” Why not just have the figure in SI? This seems a little lazy…</p>
              <p>“Movements… those that might be expected under lockdown” Was this validated with any type of mobility data?</p>
              <p>I had this same comment the first round of submission: How did you arrive at the 70% staying home? This is awfully high? In Peru About 70% of the employed population work in the informal sector, which is one of the highest rates in Latin America. These jobs are by their nature unpredictable and often in environments making social distancing difficult. Peruvians who went out to work had to use public transport, and to sell goods in very crowded markets. Even during lockdown. So your 70% baseline compliance seems to be a gross overestimation. </p>
              <p>There were some 2-week period lockdowns enforced with the last one in January 2021, but no record of such a stringent number. </p>
              <p>I don’t think this paper shows useful simulations…. The choice of seasons is weird, “this back in time” is slightly pointless as these seasons were affected by mobility, weather and other factors of those years.</p>
              <p>While I appreciate the sensitivity analysis that I had requested, I still think that the baseline should be the actual length and the actual dates of lockdowns. Also why not use information of dengue in this season?</p>
              <p>Why is the lockdown 3 months as the baseline? This is not what happened? </p>
              <p>Line 219: “According to the most recent available information, there are 92,896 buildings in Iquitos.” Why not cite where this information came from?</p>
              <p>I’m also confused as to why under lockdown the number of people per house is more homogeneous. Shouldn’t we except this to actually be the opposite? Since these regions vary widely in terms of socio-demography. The latest National Household Survey suggests 11.8% of poor households in Peru live in overcrowded homes. So I wonder if your household transmission may need to be reassessed?</p>
              <p>Line 257: “In all baseline analyses, we used values of 70% compliance with lockdown orders and a lockdown length of three months.” I still don’t understand why this is the baseline. This is not realistic.</p>
              <p>Because I don’t understand the baseline and the choice of season, I have trouble believing the results.</p>
              <p>Further, there is high heterogeny is compliance between regions and so this blanket compliance seem unrealistic. The authors argue that a major strength is the study is the spatial component, yet I don’t see any sensible calibration in this regard. On the contrary.</p>
              <p>Im pasting comments from my first round review that I feel still haven’t been address: </p>
              <p>Why not use data driven reductions? Also we know that individual response to lockdown is heterogeneous. It would be good to see actual movement data for the region used, these data, while not easily available before the pandemic, are now widely available (eg., facebook mobility data, Apple, google). Reference 30 is from 2014 as such would only serve as baseline movement pre pandemic. These crude homogenous decreases end up being over -under estimations of the actual patterns of movement. </p>
              <p>Last time I also asked If there is evidence of reduction on vector control campaigns (I didn't find any) Should perhaps instead of all or none control campaigns, a spectrum of coverage be explored?</p>
