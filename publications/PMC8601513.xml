              <abstract>
                <p>Comprehensive testing schemes, followed by adequate contact tracing and isolation, represent the best public health interventions we can employ to reduce the impact of an ongoing epidemic when no or limited vaccine supplies are available and the implications of a full lockdown are to be avoided. However, the process of tracing can prove feckless for highly-contagious viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. The interview-based approaches often miss contacts and involve significant delays, while digital solutions can suffer from insufficient adoption rates or inadequate usage patterns. Here we present a novel way of modelling different contact tracing strategies, using a generalized multi-site mean-field model, which can naturally assess the impact of manual and digital approaches alike. Our methodology can readily be applied to any compartmental formulation, thus enabling the study of more complex pathogen dynamics. We use this technique to simulate a newly-defined epidemiological model, SEIR-T, and show that, given the right conditions, tracing in a COVID-19 epidemic can be effective even when digital uptakes are sub-optimal or interviewers miss a fair proportion of the contacts.</p>

                <title>1.1 Problem overview</title>
                <p>The epidemic started in Wuhan, China by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has uncontrollably spread through communities from all around the world, rapidly becoming a major global threat, which was responsible for more than 237 million infections and 4.8 million deaths by October 2021 [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Prompted by the scale of this epidemic, cross-disciplinary teams started working against the clock to develop reliable pathogen spreading models that could be used to assess the effectiveness of different public health interventions. Since imposing a general lockdown has proven economically unbearable for most countries, the attention significantly shifted to less restrictive yet partially successful measures, such as educating the public to socially distance, deploying large-scale testing and quarantining contacts through various tracing mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The latter proved rather challenging for the traditional interview-based approaches, mostly due to significant delays, staffing issues and a generally poor recollection exhibited by the interviewees. As a result, digital alternatives were quickly sought after by several governments. These were or are currently being deployed in many states, most of them being reliant on either a Bluetooth solution, such as the Exposure Notification (GAEN) system [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], or a geolocation-based software, similar to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme in India [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. That being said, the efficiency of these strategies remains largely dependent on the application adoption rates and the behavioral patterns of their userbase (i.e. self-isolation compliance, respecting the usage guidance, keeping the tracing device turned on etc.). Although some have suggested an application uptake of at least 50% would be needed at the population level to contain the epidemic [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], others showed via simulations that 60% would be enough to stop the spread without requiring further interventions [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. That being said, the adoption levels generally quoted in the literature as “sufficient” remain mostly unattainable due to privacy concerns and internet access limitations. The picture gets even more intricate when the aforementioned behavioral issues are widespread in the users’ communities or if inadequate testing regimes and manual tracing procedures are employed.</p>
                <p>Motivated by the limited evidence we have of the efficacy exhibited by contact tracing methods in the face of such challenges, we developed a <italic toggle="yes">multi-site mean-field</italic> model that can simulate the joint effects of these variables on the evolution of an epidemic, and used it to study COVID-19 via a new disease-specific compartmental formulation—SEIR-T. Our methodology draws inspiration from the work of [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but it enables the simulation of more varied scenarios involving digital tracing at different uptake levels <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>, manual tracing with various network overlaps Γ, or both procedures combined. Additionally, we propose separating the “traced” status from the infection states, thus allowing for a node to get isolated at all times (unless it has reached an end state, i.e. recovered or dead), while also ensuring self-isolation can end due to non-compliance or term expiration, all without impacting an individual’s standard disease progression. This feature also makes our approach directly compatible with any other compartmental model. As is customary, all our code was made publicly available (see <xref rid="pone.0259969.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).</p>
                <p>The experiments we conducted confirm that the potency of contact tracing not only depends on the accuracy of the tracing network, but also on several other variables (i.e. testing rates, tracing reliability, staffing and delays, public-health communiqués, isolation conformity etc.), an optimal configuration of these given a country’s epidemiological situation being essential for a swift viral containment. Even when lower uptakes are registered (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> &lt; 0.4) or the interviewing process misses many contacts (Γ ≤ 0.5), our simulations suggest that significant reductions in the peak of infections and the total number of deaths can still be achieved given small tracing delays and the appropriate levels of testing and self-isolation compliance. What is more, the combined effects of manual and digital tracing can drive the effective reproduction number <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> below 1 even when neither is very efficient. We validate our results on numerous parameter configurations and several classic network topologies, including random Erdős–Rényi [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], scale-free [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], small-world [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and a real social network [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>

                <p>In recent years, modelling epidemics has mainly been achieved via either of two paradigms: agent-based (ABM) or equation-based models (EBM). The first represents a bottom-up approach in which a set of behaviors are attributed to each agent in a topological system. These behaviors dictate every individual’s action patterns through this topology, and ultimately determine the execution of different discrete interaction events (e.g. infection spreading, tracing notification broadcasting etc). ABMs tend to be relatively complex and resource-intensive to simulate, the involved cost being often justified by their exhibited level of granularity and their ability to monitor public interventions at the individual level [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Government-advising groups in the UK decided to employ this paradigm early on in the COVID-19 pandemic to estimate the effects of such interventions [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259969.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A more recent Oxford study looked at the combined effects of manual tracing with digital solutions, at various application uptakes, via a rich yet scalable ABM fitted to mobility data from different counties in Washington [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We consider their findings the strongest modelling evidence to date that digital tracing can be effective even at low adoption rates.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, EBMs define a set of equations that express the evolution of certain <italic toggle="yes">continuous</italic> observables over time. These generally represent system states (called compartments) showing how a disease progresses through a population. The SIR process, a widely-known EBM, utilizes three ordinary differential equations to model a generic epidemic [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Extensions of SIR were subsequently used to simulate the transmission of many pathogens, including Zika [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], Ebola [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and most recently SARS-CoV-2—e.g. SIDARTHE [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], SUQC [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The present study employs a variation of the compartmental model designed by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm) to study the impact of lockdown exit strategies on the spread of COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
                <p>At the intersection of these two paradigms lies the category of multi-site mean-field models which combine the mathematical rigour and the superior generalizability of EBMs with the ability to leverage locality information regarding every individual. Similarly to ABMs, the infection spreads over a predefined network that can either be random [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or inferred from real data [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], yet unlike ABMs, the dynamics are fully characterized by state transition equations. Huerta and Tsimring first employed this technique for modelling contact tracing in a generic epidemic [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259969.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Farrahi et al. took the idea a step further by restricting the tracing propagation to a subset of the infection network, thus accounting for the inherently noisy nature of this process [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Even though both of these exhibited powerful modelling capabilities, they were limited by their underlying compartmental formulation (SIRT) which made several unrealistic assumptions that do not generalize to real viral diseases: inter alia, the recovery was conditioned on tracing, susceptibles could not be wrongfully isolated, a traced person remained noninfectious for the full duration of the epidemic. Our modelling approach fixes these issues by separating the traced/isolated status from the infection state, therefore allowing for all the “active” nodes (i.e. not hospitalized, recovered or dead) to become traced or exit self-isolation after a certain amount of time without changing their corresponding disease progression. Concurrently, this modification enables one to simulate the effects of contact tracing, independently of the compartmental model used.</p>
                <p>For the sake of completeness, we would also like to mention that branching process models for epidemics have become increasingly popular in the last few years [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259969.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. One such model, concerned with studying the effects of manual contact identification together with digital tracing solutions at various uptakes on the COVID-19 pandemic, has recently been proposed [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Simulations conducted with it show that effective manual tracing needs to be coupled with an application uptake of at least 75% to achieve containment, although smaller adoption rates can decrease the reproduction number <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> if combined with other public health interventions. Our results are in accordance with the latter observation, but they also show that, given the right testing and tracing regimes (including good self-isolation compliance), lower and achievable adoption levels are actually enough to significantly reduce the viral spread, subject to the social network’s connectivity patterns.</p>

                <p>The tracing graphs are usually subset views of the true contacts network, where missing edges correspond to application misuse in the digital setting or contacts not recalled in the manual interviewing process, while isolated vertices are used to represent individuals that never run a government’s digital solution or are effectively unreachable. Be that as it may, people can at times overestimate the number or the duration of their social interactions [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and thus it is possible that tracers are occasionally pursuing erroneous links. Even though our model can simulate “false” contacts, similarly to [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we consider their occurrence quite rare during a global pandemic (and thus negligible), since the public health personnel is particularly well-trained and the general public is more attentive.

                <p>Throughout our experiments, we assume a “traced” individual (i.e. in state <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>) automatically enters self-isolation, so infecting or getting infected remains impossible until it becomes “non-isolating” (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>). This can happen either legally (after 14 days) or unlawfully (with a probability of <italic toggle="yes">η</italic> scaled by the time elapsed since isolating). In addition, we presume that a node’s probability to get infected proportionately increases with the amount of infectious neighbors it has in the contacts network, while the likelihood of being traced and compliant with self-isolation recommendations is directly proportional to the number of adjacent <italic toggle="yes">T</italic> nodes it features in each tracing subnetwork.</p>

                <title>2.3 Simulation overview</title>
                <p>The baseline simulations in this study were run over Erdős–Rényi random graphs (ER), featuring different population sizes and average degrees. It is worth mentioning that, although the epidemiological literature has widely adopted it, this type of graph model tends to be unsuitable for capturing the interaction patterns of many real social networks [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In spite of this, Tsimring and Huerta concluded that the SIRT-induced epidemic dynamics stays “qualitatively similar” between ER and the empirically motivated class of small-world graphs, since the realizations of both these models feature a well-defined epidemic threshold [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This result should also hold for our framework, considering that we model tracing in a fairly analogous fashion. What is more, the ER’s inherent ability to accommodate the characteristics of randomly mixed populations [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] makes it an adequate vehicle for studying outbreaks in public places, such as stores or mass transit conveyances [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Random mixing models, in turn, were shown to offer acceptable estimates of the total epidemic size when the transmission probability is high or the infectious period is relatively small [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], conditions that are usually satisfied in the case of COVID-19 breakouts. Nonetheless, several experiments involving more realistic small-world (SW) and scale-free networks (SF) are the focus of a more detailed exploration in Secton 3.4. We note here that ABM simulations, mobility or contact tracing datasets could be utilized in conjunction with the configuration model to obtain even more accurate predictions for particular lifelike scenarios [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259969.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but these do not offer any generalization guarantee.</p>
                <p>It is a known fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is an overdispersed infectious agent [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259969.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and like many other pathogens with a high epidemic potential [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], the disease diffusion is largely driven by “superspreading” events [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. As such, SFs like the Barabási-Albert networks [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] tend to offer a sounder representation of the transmission chain since superspreaders can be adequately modelled as hubs in a specific social graph [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259969.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], while the latter naturally arise as a result of the preferential attachment process that underpins SFs. On the other hand, SWs more closely resemble interactions in social networks due to their larger clustering coefficient, while clusters, in turn, have been shown to be an important catalyst of the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. We believe our modelling technique of preferentially sampling nodes with a higher traced neighbor count for undergoing quarantine to be similar in nature to the frequency-based contact tracing procedure employed in [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and thus we expect superspreaders inside SFs to get swiftly targeted by our control framework, subject to the strength of the contact tracing rate. Moreover, as we mentioned earlier, the tracing-imbued epidemic dynamics over SWs is akin to that of ERs, and thus similar levels of tracing efficiency are to be expected for both these graph models. It is therefore sensible to assume that the modelling mechanism we employ remains suitable for assessing the effects of tracing over a broader range of network types (other than ERs).</p>
                <p>In contrast to the above, Secton 3.5 investigates the effects of digital and manual tracing in a viral outbreak simulated over a real social network, representing a tightly-connected community of 74 students and graduates from MIT who agreed to have their location and interactions monitored via WLAN and Bluetooth scans over an entire academic year (detailed exploratory analyses of the dataset can be examined in [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259969.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). In our simulations, this dynamic network changes daily over a period of 31 weeks, its links being <italic toggle="yes">weighted</italic> by the aggregated number of Bluetooth proximities recorded between their corresponding corner points on each particular day. In the static settings presented thus far, <italic toggle="yes">K</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">X</italic></sup> represents a function mapping nodes to the total number of neighbors in state <italic toggle="yes">X</italic> ∈ {<italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">p</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">s</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>} (see <xref rid="pone.0259969.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

                <p>In this work, the time intervals between two state changes of the same kind are assumed to form an exponential distribution, with the λ rate equal to the corresponding transition label displayed in <xref rid="pone.0259969.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. Choosing this distribution for timing the infection propagation, in particular, keeps our approach in line with many previous epidemiological works relying on compartmental formulations [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259969.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259969.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], while also being in accordance with the findings of different cohort studies involving wearable tracking devices that reported roughly-exponential decays in their participants’ histogram of interactions [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259969.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Similar cohort studies found heavier-tailed distributions based on power laws to be more compatible with the time intervals between successive interactions, citing the bursty nature of social dynamics as the determining factor [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259969.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], yet the corresponding data fit was often imperfect while extensive comparisons against exponentials were not performed. In the epidemiological setting, several authors have argued for a shift towards more realistic and flexible Gamma (more commonly Erlang [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259969.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]) or Weibull distributions [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] for the infection waiting times, emphasizing the non-Markovian behavior that epidemics occasionally exhibit. That being said, exponentials have been shown to provide a particularly good fit to epidemiological data when the mean generation time is correctly fixed [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] or the mean infection duration is smaller [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Both of these conditions constitute sensible assumptions in our case.</p>
                <p>For efficiency, we simulate the COVID-19 outbreaks using Gillespie’s algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], which has been shown to be stochastically exact to and faster than the Monte Carlo method (MC) for both static and dynamic network-based diffusion processes [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Compared to a continuous-time MC simulation, which entails sampling the next transition for all the possible state changes, discarding all but the most “recent” event [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], Gillespie’s procedure directly draws the time elapsed until the next transition and identifies the state change most likely to have taken place within that period.

                <title>3.1 Variation induced by population size</title>
                <p>Initial simulations using ER graphs suggested the degree of variability across runs scales with the number of nodes. In order to verify this hypothesis, we design an experiment in which we vary the population size: <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> ∈ {200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 20000}, while keeping the other parameters fixed at: average degree <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 10, <italic toggle="yes">dual network</italic> tracing with uptake <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.5 (overlap Γ implicitly derived), asymptomatic probability <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub> = 0.2, contact tracing rate <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> = 0.1, and testing rate <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> = 0.1, with one infectious individual set for time <italic toggle="yes">t<sub>0</sub></italic>. We note that, as <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> = <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> &gt; <italic toggle="yes">β</italic>, contact tracing is expected to engulf the infection percolation in the limit. However, by choosing an uptake value considerably smaller than 1, we ensure our variance analysis remains significant since many of the randomly-generated tracing views end up producing a much slower discontinuation of otherwise quickly-contained infection cascades. This results in a high probability for finite outbreaks to occur during the early stages of the simulations (i.e. above the epidemic threshold for enough time).</p>
                <p>The statistics in <xref rid="pone.0259969.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> size represent averages over several simulations conducted with each of the 10 different network initializations picked by a random sampler, filtering out those iterations which registered less than three overall infected (for a total of 80–100 simulations overall per each value of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>). The data confirm the variance in peaks of infection increases as the network expands, aspect which can be explained by the growing difference between early-stopped and full-blown outbreaks. In contrast, the uncertainty in estimating the relative percentage of these maximal points expectedly decays with the size (≈ according to <inline-formula id="pone.0259969.e017"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0259969.e017.jpg" id="pone.0259969.e017g" position="anchor"/><mml:math id="M17" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mfrac></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>), a choice of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 1000 resulting in a tolerable standard deviation of almost 3%, while <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 10000 leads to an even smaller variability of &lt;1% across runs. Consequently, we consider these two values representative for our model’s expressive power given a randomly-mixed population, and, as such, we use them both in our experiments. We account for the corresponding difference in variances by simulating 7 different networks with 15 random seeds each for <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 10000, but 50 networks and 15 seeds in the case of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 1000. We note this result may not hold in the case of structured populations, yet nevertheless we reproduce the latter of the two setups in the SF-SW experiment for consistency.</p>

                <title>3.2 Tracing overlap in larger populations</title>
                <p>Going forward, we want to assess the effect of varying a tracing network’s accuracy (i.e. overlap) in an outbreak involving a large community of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 10000 individuals. To achieve this, we use the following parameter configuration: an average degree <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 10, <italic toggle="yes">dual network</italic> tracing with overlap Γ ∈ {0.11, 0.22, …, 1} (uptake <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> is implicitly derived), asymptomatic probability <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub> = 0.2, a tracing rate <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> ∈ {0.01, 0.04, 0.07, 0.1}, a testing rate <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> ∈ {.001, 0.01, 0.04, 0.07, 0.1}, and a non-compliance rate <italic toggle="yes">η</italic> = 0 (assuming everybody self-isolates until they are no longer infectious), with a single <italic toggle="yes">I<sub>p</sub></italic> node sampled at time <italic toggle="yes">t<sub>0</sub></italic>. The resulting statistics get averaged over 105 runs, as previously described.</p>
                <p><xref rid="pone.0259969.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> shows that a sub-optimal test rate, such as <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> = 0.001, leads to inconclusive results, where the variance induced by the stochasticity of the process shadows any benefit obtained through contact tracing. With better testing, clearer patterns start to emerge: The higher the contact tracing rate, the better the peak suppression is and the faster it gets approached (see <xref rid="pone.0259969.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). As <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> becomes even more effective, smaller tracing network overlaps are needed to swiftly reduce that maximum point. Looking at the tracing rate, a moderate value of <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> ∈ {0.04, 0.07} achieves a delay in the peak for smaller Γ, but this can occasionally lead to a prolonged epidemic, especially for overlaps in the “noise” region like Γ = 0.11, since initially-uninfected regions may get incorrectly traced, so the epidemic has the chance to gain momentum once those individuals exit self-isolation. In contrast, noticeable reductions with no such side effect can be observed for Γ ≥ 0.5. On the other hand, a small value of <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> = 0.01 seems unable to produce a positive outcome. In real life, the latter scenario would occur if the tracing programme was very slow, missing too many contacts as a result, or if the digital contacts application failed to promptly notify many of its active users.

                <title>3.3 Effects of average degree and app uptake</title>
                <p>Further, we analyse the impact of the application uptake in scenarios with different average degrees (<italic toggle="yes">K</italic> ∈ 10, 20), and more appropriate testing and tracing strategies—i.e. <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5}. For this trial, we set <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 1000, the asymptomatic probability to <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub> = 0.2, and the non-compliance rate to <italic toggle="yes">η</italic> = 0.001 (with automatic isolation exit after 14 days), selecting a single <italic toggle="yes">I<sub>p</sub></italic> node as the infection seed.

For <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> = 0.05, uptakes <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> ≤ 0.5 generally give results within the noise region. Improving the contact tracing rate, however, leads to a noticeable decrease of this maximal point, even at smaller adoption levels. This is particularly true in the larger average degree case. Interestingly, deploying a wider-scale testing programme alone (<italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> = 0.5) seems to lead to a considerable spread reduction which makes contact tracing less beneficial at achievable uptakes (even entirely profitless in the <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 10 situation).</p>

                <p>Our findings suggest that a testing rate of <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> = 0.1 remains suitable in conjunction with contacts isolation not only for the previous experiment with <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 10000, but also in these smaller scale scenarios featuring different average degrees. Consequently, we decided to examine further the effect of such a testing regime on the evolution of the spread (<xref rid="pone.0259969.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>), the number of total deaths (<xref rid="pone.0259969.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>) and hospitalizations (S1 Fig in <xref rid="pone.0259969.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>) for <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 20. The first chart below illustrates how the epidemic curves significantly “flatten” for uptakes <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> ≥ 0.4, the effect being more apparent as the contact tracing rate increases. The second diagram puts these results into perspective by showing that the number of deaths can be reduced even with lower uptakes, while at the other end of the spectrum many simulations have ended with notably fewer deceased (even none for an effective tracing <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> ≥ 0.2).</p>

For the purpose of this experiment, we make use of a more representative graph structure for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on the Holme and Kim (HK) model [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which features both a SF degree distribution and a SW clustering coefficient. The network parameters chosen here are: <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 1000, <italic toggle="yes">m</italic> = 10 (number of random edges to add for each new node; this replaces <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> in <xref rid="pone.0259969.e007" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq 1</xref> for calculating <italic toggle="yes">N</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">ute</italic></sub>) and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>△</sub> = 0.2 (probability of making a triangle after adding a random edge).

This is a direct consequence of the increased number of infected people selected for time <italic toggle="yes">t<sub>0</sub></italic>, which prevents simulations from averaging over too many early-stopped runs. Considering the scale this pandemic has reached and the unavoidable presence of a delay between the infection onset and the debut of tracing, scenarios such as this one are more likely to occur, and therefore of a greater interest [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259969.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p>

                <p><xref rid="pone.0259969.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12</xref> shows the degree of peak suppression achieved by utilizing digital and manual tracing solutions when compared to a scenario in which no contact tracing was performed. These results suggest that, as the efficacy of the interview-based process increases (i.e. less contacts get missed), lower and achievable application adoption rates (20–50%) are sufficient to effectively reduce the maximal point of the epidemic. When the tracers are eventually able to “see” the full network of contacts (Γ = 1), varying <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> no longer impacts the spread significantly, as should be expected. In contrast, a very good testing regime (<italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> ≥ 0.2) can partially compensate for an inefficient manual tracing system (Γ = 0.1) within the aforementioned uptake range.</p>
                <p>Our estimate of <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> = 3.20 for minimal interventions (i.e. <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> = 0.05 and no tracing) during this scenario’s first week falls within the confidence interval of the basic reproduction number <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub>0</sub> ∈ [3.09, 3.24] derived in Di Domenico et al. [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] by applying the next-generation approach [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] on a model fairly similar to ours. <xref rid="pone.0259969.g013" ref-type="fig">Fig 13</xref> demonstrates that with good testing regimes (<italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> ≥ 0.1) and a reasonable manual tracing in place (Γ ≥ 0.5), achievable uptake levels are enough to limit this <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> to a value close to 1. In contrast, digital tracing alone fails to significantly reduce the spread unless both the testing and the adoption rates are very high. Similarly to what could be observed in <xref rid="pone.0259969.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12</xref>, uptakes play a minor role in the infection proliferation if tracers are able to track the whole contact network eventually, yet this scenario is rather unlikely in real life. Interestingly, most of the other trends outlined in the peak suppression charts are faithfully mirrored by the evolution of <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> in the first week of the simulation. This reinforces the fact that efficient contact tracing in the early stages of an outbreak is essential for containing a virus like SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p>
                <p>Even though peak suppression remains a good metric for assessing the benefits of public interventions, policy makers are more often interested in what combinations of these measures can quickly bring <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> to acceptable levels. In light of this, we plotted the contour lines of the <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> values produced by various degrees of interview-based network overlaps, testing and digital tracing adoption rates (see <xref rid="pone.0259969.g014" ref-type="fig">Fig 14</xref>, but also S6 Fig in <xref rid="pone.0259969.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). With an <italic toggle="yes">estimated</italic> uptake of around 40% in Finland and Ireland, 30% in the UK, or 27% in Germany and Norway at the time of writing [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], an effective testing regime (<italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> ≥ 0.2) coupled with an efficient contact tracing rate (<italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> = 0.5) can drive <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> below 1 even when tracers miss up to half the contacts (Γ ≥ 0.5). Should this adoption improve to 50%, the aforementioned effect would be obtained with a testing rate half as good. In contrast, a moderate tracing rate only becomes effective if a large-scale testing programme gets deployed (<italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> = 0.5) or bigger uptakes are achieved within a population (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> &gt; 50%). We note the quoted uptakes were approximated using the total number of application downloads, therefore due diligence should be exercised when interpreting these statistics because new downloads do not always convert to new active users.</p>

                <p>Lastly, we evaluate the ability of digital tracing to curb an epidemic simulated over a real social network, in the presence or the absence of manual contact tracing. In this scenario, both the population size <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> and the average degree <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> are data-driven, with the latter also changing dynamically (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 74, <inline-formula id="pone.0259969.e020"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0259969.e020.jpg" id="pone.0259969.e020g" position="anchor"/><mml:math id="M20" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>62</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> at time <italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub>0</sub>). Given that the network represents a tightly-knit community (static average degree <italic toggle="yes">K</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">static</italic></sub> &gt; 60), we investigate a broader range of testing and tracing rates: <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5}, <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2}. The uptakes <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>, the overlaps Γ, and the initial incidence <italic toggle="yes">c</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub>0</sub>) are left unchanged from the last passage, while the relative delay between digital and manual tracing is kept at 2 days on average. The probability of becoming an asymptomatic case following exposure is fixed at <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub> = 0.2 for the purpose of our initial discussion, but a comparison to the case in which <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub> = 0.5 can be consulted at the end of this section.</p>
                <p>The first thing to note about both Figs <xref rid="pone.0259969.g015" ref-type="fig">15</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0259969.g016" ref-type="fig">16</xref> is that each presents qualitatively similar trends to their counterpart figures from the previous experiment (i.e Figs <xref rid="pone.0259969.g012" ref-type="fig">12</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0259969.g013" ref-type="fig">13</xref>, respectively). Namely, the better the testing and tracing rates are, the higher the benefit. At the same time, lower uptakes, in conjunction with an adequate overlap Γ ≥ 0.5, consistently achieve significant peak reductions, driving the <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> estimate of the first week below 1.5, even when the testing rate is smaller than 0.5. In contrast, with higher uptake values, the degree of overlap becomes less relevant for the epidemic outcome. Interestingly, the benefits of increasing the tracing effort <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> beyond the value of 1 remain minimal across parameter configurations, and therefore we restrict further analyses to the range [0.1, 1].</p>

When comparing these results to <xref rid="pone.0259969.g014" ref-type="fig">Fig 14</xref>, we can see that a significantly faster testing strategy would be needed in this case to swiftly contain the epidemic and force <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> &lt; 1. This is a consequence of dealing with an outbreak in such a lively and highly-interactive community, where the virus spreads too rapidly to afford testing at a lower rate than 0.5 (or even 1 in some cases) if the objective is to keep <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> subunitary. Similarly, an efficient <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> ≥ 0.5 is needed for achievable uptakes to attain (or be close to) the aforementioned goal. Where limited public health resources are available, locking down or restricting the movements within such hubs is therefore recommendable.</p>

                <p>Finally, we investigate whether the efficacy of tracing appreciably changes when different <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub> values are considered. An asymptomatic node is assumed to be less infectious—<italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">I</italic></sup> = 0.5, but also less likely to get tested positive—<italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">T</italic></sup> = 0.8, so the epidemic dynamics should significantly differ when varying this probability. Remarkably, however, we observe the benefits of contact tracing do not fluctuate across the two studied values in the majority of the scenarios under scrutiny (see Figs <xref rid="pone.0259969.g018" ref-type="fig">18</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0259969.g019" ref-type="fig">19</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="pone.0259969.g019" ref-type="fig">Fig 19</xref>, the most apparent differences in <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> were recorded when less accurate tracing networks (Γ, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> &lt; 0.5) and less effective testing rates (<italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">r</italic></sub> &lt; 0.5) were employed. That is to say a suboptimal “test and trace” policy leads to more people getting infected when <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub> = 0.2, yet this higher rate of infectiousness can be offset by the smaller likelihood of nodes testing positive in the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub> = 0.5 scenario, ultimately leading to minimal dissimilarities for the more adequate policies.</p>

              <title>4 Conclusions and future work</title>
              <p>This paper demonstrated how a novel methodology for modelling the effects of different “test and trace” strategies can be applied to study the transmission dynamics of a complex viral epidemic, such as COVID-19. Following a comprehensive analysis of the model’s parameters, the procedures described here can be utilised to predict how the SARS-CoV-2 virus would spread through those communities where some indication of the interview-based network overlap and/or the digital tracing uptake exists. To facilitate such endeavors, we made our entire codebase open-source (refer to <xref rid="pone.0259969.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).</p>
              <p>The approach we propose can address from a modelling perspective four of the open questions formulated by Anglemyer et al. in their Cochrane Review [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]: the combined effects of digital and manual tracing can be studied via the triad network topology, populations with poor access to the internet may be factored in by the degree of overlap Γ, individuals that have privacy concerns or accessibility issues can be represented in the system via the application adoption rate <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>, while the ethical and economical repercussions of balancing false positives and false negatives of tracing can be assessed through the statistics our simulations readily capture (for more details, consult S2 and S3 Figs in <xref rid="pone.0259969.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). Consequently, the model we put forward is already powerful enough to answer a large spectrum of research and policy-related questions.</p>
              <p>The simulations we conducted show that digital tracing remains a viable solution for reducing the peak of an outbreak, as well as the effective reproduction number <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>, even when its adoption levels are lower. At the same time, a less efficient interview-based process, which misses up to half the contacts, can still contain the spread if coupled with 30–40% application uptakes and large-scale testing regimes. For highly-connected communities, the latter condition becomes even more essential for swift containment. The peak reduction seems ubiquitously tied to how fast the tracing is conducted, as well as how impactful the public-health messages are in making the involved communities more compliant with the self-isolation recommendations, as soon as more and more of each individual’s contacts get traced and isolated (aspects encompassed in the <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> rate).</p>
              <p>We would like to emphasize that the parameter ranges under scrutiny in this study are by no means exhaustive. Therefore, we leave for future exploration studying the effects of extensively varying the average degrees of the random networks, the non-isolation rates, the initial infections, or the variant-specific asymptomatic and hospitalization probabilities. Looking at such diverse scenarios would allow one to better estimate the shortfalls of contact tracing when different variants of concern are circulating, discover factors that may have introduced significant inefficiencies into the strategies adopted by many countries (e.g. higher non-compliance [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]), while also ensuring the variability induced by early-stopped simulations is curbed.</p>
              <p>Next, we envision leveraging several mobility datasets in subsequent endeavors to infer a broader range of network structures, and derive time-dependent estimates of the transmission rate, as previously described in Liu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Other parameters in our model could be tailored to the epidemiological situation of different countries by fitting them to governmental data reporting on the number of COVID-19 deaths registered within each region of interest.</p>
              <p>Finally, the random nature of testing and deriving static tracing views in this study may not provide the most realistic setup. Strategically targeting mass-testing campaigns to hubs or dynamically intensifying tracing efforts in highly-affected regions could significantly improve the outcome of an outbreak. To finely control the network dynamics in such an informed fashion, we expect future studies to utilize a combination of graph neural networks and gradient-based reinforcement learning techniques, possibly leveraging the setup recently proposed by Meirom et al. for prioritizing the viral testing allocation [<xref rid="pone.0259969.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Rusu,</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors present a model combining the spread of an epidemic with a mitigation strategy based on contact tracing and isolation. The model is a multi-site mean-field model combining equations for the evolution of compartment size and the use of an underlying network of contacts between agents. Exploring the range of parameters, they test several scenarios of tracing efficiency and their impact on outbreaks. They find that imperfect tracing can nonetheless have a sufficient impact to significantly lower the epidemic peak.</p>
              <p>The topic is interesting and addresses the very actual challenge of quantifying the impact of realistic mitigating strategies on epidemic outbreaks. As such, the study is perfectly valid and presents interesting results that could inform health policies.</p>
              <p>I have however some issues with the model and some claims the authors make:</p>
              <p>- The compartmental model used for describing the epidemic process is much more complicated than the classic ones. It is understandable, as the authors aim at describing realistic outbreaks of SARS-COV-2, in particular with the use of the Ip (pre-contagious), Ia (asymptomatic) and Is (symptomatic) compartments. However, the separation between H (hospitalised), R (recovered) and D is not necessarily useful, as D will only be a fraction from H set by lambda_H-D, and all remaining agents in the H compartment end up in the R one.</p>
              <p>- The mechanisms for generating the tracing networks are not described. How are the links chosen, when, and by which mechanism? Is the tracing connected to new infections or not? If not (as this is a mean-field approach), the model might have an intrinsic limitation due to the absence of correlation between the infection process and the network.</p>
              <p>- On the same topic, at line 127 the authors say: "The tracing graphs are usually subsets of the first network." When is this not the case? From the model described in ref 21, I get that tracing might generate "false" contacts, but this is not said at any point in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>- The authors validate most of their findings using Erdös-Rényi networks, claiming that "it tends to offer acceptable approximations most of the time" (l146). I must argue that it does not, and in fact the authors themselves then use a scale-free/high clustering model in section 3.4. Why not directly use this one, which is indeed more realistic? They also could use empirical datasets, which are easily found in the community.</p>
              <p>- Another problem is the temporality of the spreading. Line 155, the authors state: "The time intervals between two state changes of the same kind are assumed to form an exponential distribution". This is very unrealistic. As shown in a wide range of empirical studies, human interactions exhibit bursty behaviour, with distributions of temporal properties having typical heavy-tails. It has been further shown that such properties condition strongly the spread of an epidemic (see for example Lambiotte et al EPJB 86 (2013) 320).</p>
              <p>- I suggest the author define the measures they used to quantify the effect of tracing in the text. In particular, what is "peak suppression"? I would recommend a clearer measure, such as a normalised peak reduction (N_(no tracing) - N_tracing)/(N_(no tracing)). Same approach could be used for time of peak.</p>
              <p>- l203 : The authors select "good" values for tau_r and tau_t, but it seems to me that there is a correlation between the threshold values of tau_r and tau_t. It would be interesting to see heatmaps combining both dependencies.</p>
              <p>- I have a question about the results presented in Fig 5, top right quadrant. It seems that the larger the population, the smaller the maximum infected fraction of the population, with a limit going to 0 as N increases. This would indicate that the model does not generate large cascades of infections, while spreading processes —being analog to percolation— should always reach a non-zero fraction of the population when the infection parameter is above the epidemic threshold. If accurate, doesn't it indicate an intrinsic unrealistic property of the model? It could also be that the parameters chosen for the study in section 3.1 lead to a spreading under the epidemic threshold, but in that case the analysis of the variation induced by population size is irrelevant.</p>
              <p>- The study would be much stronger if the model was explored and validated for a larger range of spreading parameters. Only two values for p_a and one for p_h are considered. I understand that the authors have used estimated values from the empirical studies, but since the model for interactions is not realistic, it might be that these values are not suitable to reproduce the desired spreading properties (see my previous comment).</p>
              <p>- Similarly, only two values for K are considered.</p>
              <p>- I understand that the model is complex and the parameter space is huge, but the current results merely rely on eye-balling "relevant" values from a minimal set of tries. Deriving quantitative, meaningful results from such an evaluation of "proper" values for the parameters seems too optimistic.</p>
              <p>- Manual tracing and digital tracing seem to be a sort of redundant system, to increase the global tracing efficiency. Shouldn't the use of both be equivalent to having a single, higher value of either digital tracing or manual tracing?</p>
              <p>- I would appreciate that the authors discuss two features from Fig 7:</p>
              <p>1. How can contact tracing lead to situations in which the outbreak lasts longer?</p>
              <p>2. What generates the bimodality of some curves?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, I have some minor issues with the manuscript:</p>
              <p>- I would advise for replacing ref 21 with "R. Huerta, L. Tsimring, Phys. Rev. E 66 (2002) 056 115". I am not an expert on multi-site mean-field models, and I found that the latter reference contains a much clearer description of the approach than the one given by the authors.</p>
              <p>- l196 : please move the reference to Fig 7 at the relevant location ; the current one is a sentence about Fig 6.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The paper presents a novel (SEIR-type) compartmental model of epidemic spread that accounts for possible manual and/or digital contact tracing by describing the individuals’ state by a pair of variables, one that describes its epidemic state and a second that describes whether it is traced (and isolating) or not. The authors explore the properties of the model using simulations, and show on synthetic data that combined manual and digital contact tracing may be effective in curbing the simulated spread of SARS-COV2 even with either of the two tracing modalities is suboptimal.</p>
              <p>The paper is generally technically sound and the writing is clear and understandable. Though, given the large number of different parameters and tests performed it is sometimes difficult for the reader to recall everything and follow the story. I recommend the manuscript for publication in PLOS ONE after the authors have addressed several, mostly technical, points and some optional suggestions that I think may help the reader when reading the paper.</p>
              <p>The conclusions of the simulation study are weakened by the fact that they rely solely on simulated contact networks which lack many realistic features of real world contact patterns. I think the model in itself and the present study merit publication on their own, but it would be a big plus if the authors could motivate that the networks’ parameters are realistic and that the missing features do not change the conclusions, and/or perform simulations on empirical contact networks.</p>
              <p>The model has a lot of different variables and parameters and it is difficult to keep track of them all. It would be very helpful to list all of them in a table, similar to Table 1. Namely: \\Gamma, K, r, t_rem. It might also helpful to list the different compartments (states) of the model.</p>
              <p>In the same manner, it would make the manuscript easier to read if the names, or short definitions, were given for each of the parameters when their ranges considered are listed in each subsection of the Results, e.g., on lines 187 and 188 recall that \\Gamma is the degree of overlap, \\tau_t the contact tracing rate, etc.</p>
              <p>Add values of all relevant parameters to figure captions. This will make the figures easier to read.</p>
              <p>It is unintuitive to use S_i for general states and S for the susceptible state. I suggest the authors use another symbol to denote a general state, e.g. X_i.</p>
              <p>The fact that the relative error is ~3% for networks of size N=1000 and ~1% for N=10000 is corresponds to a relative error of 1/\\sqrt{N}, consistent with central limit type arguments for a well mixed population. The result may not hold however in a structured population or near a critical point and thus cannot necessarily be extrapolated to general conditions.</p>
              <p>The authors refer to some parameters of their model as “hyperparameters”. This term is generally reserved for parameters of an inference procedure, not a model, e.g., of the learning procedure in machine learning or of prior distributions in Bayesian inference.</p>
              <p>The authors compare the uptake rate in the simulations to the digital tracing adoption rates reported for different countries. However, the adoption rates cited are typically calculated as numbers of download relative to the population, which is not the same as the fraction of population using the app correctly.</p>
              <p>In Section 3.4, if I understood correctly, the overlap between edges in the digital contact tracing network and the true contact network is assumed to be perfect, while the uptake in the manual tracing network is assumed to be 100%. Both of these assumptions seem overly optimistic to me, e.g., the manual contact tracing system will saturate at a given prevalence as was seen in most western countries, while digital contacts are only proxies for real (possibly disease transmitting) contacts.</p>
              <p>Please corroborate the claim (on lines 144-146) that the Erdos-Renyi graph model tends to offer acceptable approximations most of the time.</p>
              <p>It seems like an error that symbols in Table 1 are in boldface.</p>
              <p>The authors may want to discuss the implications of the crossover effects seen in Fig. 10, i.e., the final outbreak size can be larger for higher uptake.</p>
              <p>Can the authors comment on how realistic the required values of \\Gamma and \\tau_t for combined tracing to be effective alone are? Have the values of these parameters been estimated empirically?</p>
              <p>In Fig. 5 add description of what symbols and boxes and whiskers represent.</p>

              <p>Following the editor’s comments, we amended the supporting information references to respect the format – i.e. S1 Fig instead of Fig S1. We also limited the use of italics to very important information only. Finally, we changed the formatting of the authors section to match the suggested styling.</p>
              <p>Replies to reviewer #1:</p>
              <p>1. The compartmental model used for describing the epidemic process is much more complicated than the classic ones. It is understandable, as the authors aim at describing realistic outbreaks of SARS-COV-2, in particular with the use of the Ip (pre-contagious), Ia (asymptomatic) and Is (symptomatic) compartments. However, the separation between H (hospitalised), R (recovered) and D is not necessarily useful, as D will only be a fraction from H set by lambda_H-D, and all remaining agents in the H compartment end up in the R one.</p>
              <p>Our goal from the very beginning was to make simulations that could capture a broad range of effects stemmed from the viral spread, including the evolution of hospitalizations and deaths. We also wanted to show that, unlike previous works, our contact tracing approach can be used in conjunction with virtually any complex compartmental formulation (many of which have been proposed for COVID-19 given the inefficacy of SIR [1]). That being said, this modeling decision is in line with many different works which explicitly separated these states [2, 3], including the study we used as reference when designing our proposed model [4]. It is true that, given the setup described in our paper, D are but a fraction from H. However, having the capability of directly capturing those metrics from different compartments is not only convenient, but also more realistic and useful when visualizing the specific effects of different measures (running our code allows for visual explorations of which node gets infected/hospitalized/dead and when). Having separate states with different transition times could also be exploited in the dynamical/temporal sense to infer noteworthy trends, although such an analysis is beyond the scope of the current paper. Lastly, this setup allows for a node’s behavior within a simulation to change based on its state (for example, one may want to explore a scenario in which hospitalized/recovered people can still ping their contacts through a tracing application, whereas a deceased node would be unable to aid the tracing process).</p>

              <p>2. The mechanisms for generating the tracing networks are not described. How are the links chosen, when, and by which mechanism? Is the tracing connected to new infections or not? If not (as this is a mean-field approach), the model might have an intrinsic limitation due to the absence of correlation between the infection process and the network.</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the generation mechanism was not intuitively explained. We have revised Section 2.2 of the paper to address this point. We now describe in more detail how the tracing networks are generated, based on the 2 inter-linked parameters: “degree of overlap” and “uptake”. On one hand, the degree of overlap gets converted to Z_rem via the specified formula, quantity which represents the average number of edges that get randomly removed from the infection network to render a tracing network (this effectively means N * Z_rem / 2 edges get removed, and we have now made this explicit in the revision). On the other hand, the uptake dictates how many nodes should have all their edges removed (again at random). We average over many such tracing scenarios to reduce the potential noise induced by these random processes (hence why we mention in Section 3.1 that we simulate X different networks with Y random seeds). Consequently, the tracing networks are preset, so new infections do not technically influence their structure, but this should not pose a limitation because, in practice, we can assume this ‘static’ structure has been generated from aggregating all the potentially-observed dynamic links for any given node (i.e. a random process corresponding to tracers/apps monitoring the contacts neighborhood of any new detected infections), thus actually correlating the entire procedure to new infections. Given that presumption, the tracing propagation system becomes, in fact, directly influenced by any new detected infection / isolated node, since the latter contributes to the additive probability of encouraging its neighborhood to self-isolate (hence the multi-site nature of our mean-field approach), while the neighborhood itself gets partially observed from the aforementioned pseudo-dynamic process.</p>
              <p>That being said, removing the random nature of this operation altogether, and thus actively tying new infections to the tracing view substructure, is indeed an interesting avenue worth exploring (possibly via targeting the testing and the neighborhood exploration processes with reinforcement learning techniques, like [1] - a potential future direction for us as indicated in the revised Section 4), yet this may come at the cost of adding more bias: Currently, we assume contact tracers have a limited time to conduct their research and they do not favor any node when looking for contacts, whereas each individual’s memory constitutes an unpredictable, seemingly-random factor to model. Hence, the simplifying presumption that contacts tend to be missed at random fits these assumptions and should be less biased. This very presumption enables us to view the precomputed static subnetwork as a dynamic aggregate of randomly-removed edges.</p>

              <p>3. On the same topic, at line 127 the authors say: "The tracing graphs are usually subsets of the first network." When is this not the case? From the model described in ref 21, I get that tracing might generate "false" contacts, but this is not said at any point in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Thank you for pointing out this inconsistency. It is true that the referenced paper studies such a scenario in more detail. Our model is also capable of simulating “false” contacts, but we have decided not to study such a situation further in this paper since we deemed it less likely to happen in our global pandemic scenario, where contact tracers are generally very well trained and the public is much more aware of who they meet and for how long. We have modified Section 2.2 to better reflect this.</p>
              <p>4. The authors validate most of their findings using Erdös-Rényi networks, claiming that "it tends to offer acceptable approximations most of the time" (l146). I must argue that it does not, and in fact the authors themselves then use a scale-free/high clustering model in section 3.4. Why not directly use this one, which is indeed more realistic? They also could use empirical datasets, which are easily found in the community.</p>
              <p>We use ER networks as our baseline due to their wide adoption in the epidemic literature (including the studies we used as reference points for the spreading model [1, 2]), as well as their well-behaved epidemic dynamics in the limit, caused by the presence of epidemic thresholds (from [1], the study which introduced the SIRT model we extended, “the epidemic dynamics in SW networks remains qualitatively similar to random graphs, since they possess a well-defined epidemic threshold”). In addition to this, both real networks and ER graphs (under the studied K values) generally exhibit a single giant component, sparse densities, small average shortest paths [3,4]. Even though ER networks make a few unrealistic assumptions about the degree distribution (nodes with too many or too few connections are heavily restricted) and the independence of interactions in closed communities (where some inherent dependence certainly exists), they are still a good tool for modelling infections in randomly mixed populations [5] (e.g. in stores, public transportation etc. [6]). The first few experiments we conducted on the basis of ERs played a pivotal role in exemplifying the overall dynamics induced by different variables in our system, which we preferred to observe (for ourselves) and evoke (to the readers) in the most generalized framework, just as the predecessor papers did in their initial simulations. Indeed, the reviewer was kind to notice that we made a note of the unsuitability such a model may exhibit for social network tasks, hence why we focused the main experiments in the study on a more realistic network model, for which we actually derived our final conclusions and plotted the most representative figures on the efficacy of various contact tracing strategies w.r.t. the peak suppression and the reproduction number. We agree with the reviewer that our original statement about ERs was overly optimistic, and hence we have modified the section accordingly. We have also added Section 3.5 to the paper which details experiments we ran over a real dynamic social network. </p>

              <p>5. Another problem is the temporality of the spreading. Line 155, the authors state: "The time intervals between two state changes of the same kind are assumed to form an exponential distribution". This is very unrealistic. As shown in a wide range of empirical studies, human interactions exhibit bursty behaviour, with distributions of temporal properties having typical heavy-tails. It has been further shown that such properties condition strongly the spread of an epidemic (see for example Lambiotte et al EPJB 86 (2013) 320).</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for opening up this important discussion on the temporality involved in our simulations, which has prompted us to briefly explain our rationale in Section 2.3 of the revision. Our choice here was motivated by the exponential’s wide adoption in previous epidemiological works relying on SIR [1, 2, 4], as well as evidence of exponentially-distributed numbers of interactions over time observed in 2 reference studies for our work, which analyzed human behavior using tracking devices [2, 3]. We agree with the reviewer that our assumption can be too restrictive, especially surrounding infection times, and more flexible gamma (e.g. Erlang) or Weibull distributions represented via temporal sub-compartments could provide more realistic measurements. However, standard exponentials have been shown to offer acceptable approximations in several cases (e.g. when the mean infection duration is smaller [5], or the mean-generation time is correctly estimated [6]). As to other time intervals involved in the model (e.g. the infectious period), an older study showed that major epidemic persistence and dynamic problems could be introduced in SIR/SEIR simulations when using more realistic gamma distributions, amounting to worse results overall [7]. That is not to say using such distributions should be discouraged in SIR, but a very thoughtful consideration should be put into making this temporality choice nonetheless, carefully weighing the benefits against the potential limitations. We excluded this analysis for the purpose of the current paper, but it is definitely an interesting avenue worth exploring in subsequent studies.</p>

              <p>6. I suggest the author define the measures they used to quantify the effect of tracing in the text. In particular, what is "peak suppression"? I would recommend a clearer measure, such as a normalised peak reduction (N_(no tracing) - N_tracing)/(N_(no tracing)). Same approach could be used for time of peak.</p>
              <p>Thank you for this insightful comment. We have addressed this point by adding a clear mathematical explanation of the peak suppression in the newly added Section 2.4. We would also like to mention that the original purpose of our peak suppression plots was to emphasize the benefit of contact tracing in absolute terms (scrutinized in direct reference to the total population size, which remains fixed at either 1000 or 10000 throughout the study, making it easy for the reader to visualize the full effect). While we agree with the reviewer that normalised charts would offer a valuable alternative view of our simulation data, an unnormalized reporting directly referencing the achieved peak suppression better fits with our initial plan.</p>
              <p>7. l203 : The authors select "good" values for tau_r and tau_t, but it seems to me that there is a correlation between the threshold values of tau_r and tau_t. It would be interesting to see heatmaps combining both dependencies.</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for this suggestion. We have now added heatmaps of the 2 parameters for different degrees of overlap to the revised Section 3.4.</p>
              <p>8. I have a question about the results presented in Fig 5, top right quadrant. It seems that the larger the population, the smaller the maximum infected fraction of the population, with a limit going to 0 as N increases. This would indicate that the model does not generate large cascades of infections, while spreading processes —being analog to percolation— should always reach a non-zero fraction of the population when the infection parameter is above the epidemic threshold. If accurate, doesn't it indicate an intrinsic unrealistic property of the model? It could also be that the parameters chosen for the study in section 3.1 lead to a spreading under the epidemic threshold, but in that case the analysis of the variation induced by population size is irrelevant.</p>
              <p>As illustrated by the unnormalized values in the left quadrant, the average of the peak of infection is monotonic on the studied range, and hence, for larger populations, the disease did manage to percolate at an increased rate (in absolute terms) as expected, making the variation analysis hold (at least on this very range). In spite of this, as indicated in the right quadrant and correctly pointed out by the reviewer, the peak clearly decreases in relative importance w.r.t. the total population (and the above-named monotony is not enough to ensure a non-zero relative average in the limit). Even so, the purpose of this experiment was not to study the dynamics in the limit, but rather to check if the variability across runs scales with the number of nodes (as initially suspected), and to settle on a sensible range of values for the population size (which would not be plagued by large variances, at least relative to that size). Indeed, as the reviewer correctly intuited, the limiting behavior of the percolation process is the result of analyzing a scenario in which both tau_t and tau_r are marginally larger than the infection rate beta (0.1 against 0.0791). Should the uptake have been 100% and considering that both the infection and contact tracing “spread” in a similar fashion, the simulation would have been deterministically contained (and below the epidemic threshold with a greater probability). However, given that the uptake in this experiment is set to 50%, this is now not always the case, as some instances do get quickly contained, while others continue to percolate for longer periods, depending on the network subsetting seed. It is also worth noting here that Section 3.1 reports on the variance of peaks, rather than overall epidemic sizes. While tracing can indeed be effective at “flattening the curve”, this does not guarantee the final size actually follows the same trend (or has the same decaying shape in the limit). </p>
              <p>On a side note, our choice of studying \\tau_t=\\tau_r=0.1 here stemmed from empirical observations of this particular assignment resulting in an “average” efficacy w.r.t. preventing full-blown outbreaks, across many different parameter configurations (possibly due to the aforementioned marginal difference compared to the transmission rate). As reported in the paper, this assignment belongs to the higher-mid range of our initial setups, but also lies within the lower-mid range in the main experiments.</p>
              <p>9. The study would be much stronger if the model was explored and validated for a larger range of spreading parameters. Only two values for p_a and one for p_h are considered. I understand that the authors have used estimated values from the empirical studies, but since the model for interactions is not realistic, it might be that these values are not suitable to reproduce the desired spreading properties (see my previous comment). Similarly, only two values for K are considered. I understand that the model is complex and the parameter space is huge, but the current results merely rely on eye-balling "relevant" values from a minimal set of tries. Deriving quantitative, meaningful results from such an evaluation of "proper" values for the parameters seems too optimistic.</p>
              <p>As the reviewer kindly noted, the parameter space is indeed very large, and it is very difficult to find the most realistic values here. We concentrated our experiments on the most agreed-upon values, which were previously derived by trusted institutions and used to inform real governmental policies (by the CDC [1], by the The French National Institute of Health and Medical Research [2]). Our compartmental model was deliberately designed to be “in line” with [2], and therefore we were very composed with parameter changes (in fact, modifications were conducted only based on estimates from other trusted sources). This makes our results meaningful for the scenario in question. That being said, we consider our main contribution to be the modelling technique itself (aspect reflected in our decision to submit to this particular journal), and hence the range of the parameters was constrained to the most sensible values for presentation. A wider range of tau_r and tau_t values was, however, studied in our experiments, some significantly below and above the epidemic threshold, with the final ranges reported in the final piece being indicative of all the observed trends. We agree with the reviewer that a more thorough analysis of the parameters should be carried away in future work, especially in relation with K, and this has been marked accordingly in Section 4 (Conclusions and future work).</p>

              <p>10. Manual tracing and digital tracing seem to be a sort of redundant system, to increase the global tracing efficiency. Shouldn't the use of both be equivalent to having a single, higher value of either digital tracing or manual tracing?</p>
              <p>The two tracing systems operate on different assumptions (please refer back to Section 3.4). Namely, both conduct tracing over different networks (a sensible assumption since not all interviewees will have a COVID tracing application to notify neighbors, and there may be discrepancies between what each service “sees”). In manual tracing, the overlap controls missed contacts, while in digital tracing both an overlap (inadequate use) and an uptake rate can influence the topology (the latter does not make sense in the manual tracing case). Finally, there is an inherent delay of tracing a contact in the interview-based approach (controlled by differences in \\tau_t rates; assumed to be equal to two days in our study, but with direct support in the code for varying that delay).</p>
              <p>11. I would appreciate that the authors discuss two features from Fig 7:</p>
              <p>Thank you for the questions below. First, we would like to note that we have changed Fig 7 in the revision to match the given caption, since in the initial submission we have imported by mistake an older version of that figure (with less scenarios depicted). In the new figure, the 4 quadrants visible in the originally-submitted picture are all placed on the right column. We have also removed the case with overlap=0 since this theoretically corresponds to the same scenario as \\tau_t=0. That being said, the questions below still hold since this figure update is based on the same data and scenarios.</p>
              <p>11.1. How can contact tracing lead to situations in which the outbreak lasts longer?</p>
              <p>First of all, we must distinguish all cases from the first row, which we regard as giving mostly noisy results of the contact tracing process due to the ineffective value of \\tau_t. In some of the more-meaningful configurations, very small values of the overlap (&lt;.33) still manage to fall within the “noise region” because \\tau_t is not large enough to make their effect distinguishable from the noise induced by the inherent stochasticity of the simulations. Such a poor representation of the infection network can also lead to situations in which only incorrect regions of the graph get isolated (i.e. many false positives), which in turn can cause the epidemics to gain momentum at later stages (e.g. an obvious example is overlap=0.11 in the third quadrant). A brief explanation has been added to the revision of Section 3.2.</p>
              <p>11.2. What generates the bimodality of some curves?</p>
              <p>The effect of multiple peaks has also been noted for the SIR formulation in [1]: “with larger tracing effort, the epidemic is reduced significantly rapidly, leaving a great deal of the population susceptible for a second peak of infections[…] This is due to the contact tracing becoming so effective that the number of cases drops rapidly, resulting in tracing becoming less effective. Note, this effect is much more attenuated in the dual network case” (the “dual network case” refers to a scenario with a single contact tracing network in which the overlap is very small: 0.08). Indeed, in our case this bimodality is a rarer phenomenon which only affects a few of the simulations that exhibit large values of the overlap.</p>

              <p>12. Furthermore, I have some minor issues with the manuscript:</p>
              <p>- I would advise for replacing ref 21 with "R. Huerta, L. Tsimring, Phys. Rev. E 66 (2002) 056 115". I am not an expert on multi-site mean-field models, and I found that the latter reference contains a much clearer description of the approach than the one given by the authors.</p>
              <p>- l196 : please move the reference to Fig 7 at the relevant location ; the current one is a sentence about Fig 6</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for spotting these minor issues. Indeed, the initial paper by Huerta and Tsimring includes more details on multi-site mean-field models, but the latter features more experiments and contains further conclusions derived from them. This is why we decided to keep both references in the revision. As to Fig 7, as mentioned above, the caption was in fact correct but we imported an older version of that figure onto the system. This has now been amended.</p>
              <p>Replies to reviewer #2:</p>
              <p>1. The conclusions of the simulation study are weakened by the fact that they rely solely on simulated contact networks which lack many realistic features of real world contact patterns. I think the model in itself and the present study merit publication on their own, but it would be a big plus if the authors could motivate that the networks’ parameters are realistic and that the missing features do not change the conclusions, and/or perform simulations on empirical contact networks.</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion, and we agree that the study would benefit from showcasing the impact of contact tracing on real social networks. To that end, we have added Section 3.5 (with background explanations added to Section 2.3) where we explore a real data-driven scenario.</p>
              <p>2. The model has a lot of different variables and parameters and it is difficult to keep track of them all. It would be very helpful to list all of them in a table, similar to Table 1. </p>
              <p>Namely: \\Gamma, K, r, t_rem. It might also be helpful to list the different compartments (states) of the model.</p>
              <p>Thank you for this suggestion. A table detailing the network parameters used in our simulations has been added to the revision. A diagram of the compartments together with the available transitions has been supplied in Fig 1, with the caption detailing their meaning.</p>
              <p>3. In the same manner, it would make the manuscript easier to read if the names, or short definitions, were given for each of the parameters when their ranges considered are listed in each subsection of the Results, e.g., on lines 187 and 188 recall that \\Gamma is the degree of overlap, \\tau_t the contact tracing rate, etc.</p>
              <p>Thank you for this thoughtful suggestion. The names of the different parameters have now been made apparent at the beginning of each section.</p>
              <p>4. Add values of all relevant parameters to figure captions. This will make the figures easier to read.</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The values of the relevant parameters have now been added to the figure captions in the revised study.</p>
              <p>5. It is unintuitive to use S_i for general states and S for the susceptible state. I suggest the authors use another symbol to denote a general state, e.g. X_i.</p>
              <p>We have amended the table according to this suggestion, using X to refer to different states.</p>
              <p>6. The fact that the relative error is ~3% for networks of size N=1000 and ~1% for N=10000 is corresponds to a relative error of 1/\\sqrt{N}, consistent with central limit type arguments for a well mixed population. The result may not hold however in a structured population or near a critical point and thus cannot necessarily be extrapolated to general conditions.</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We have now made a note of the limitations our variance analysis has.</p>
              <p>7. The authors refer to some parameters of their model as “hyperparameters”. This term is generally reserved for parameters of an inference procedure, not a model, e.g., of the learning procedure in machine learning or of prior distributions in Bayesian inference.</p>
              <p>The term hyperparameters was chosen to distinguish network parameters from compartmental model parameters. We have now modified the nomenclature accordingly to avoid any confusion.</p>
              <p>8. The authors compare the uptake rate in the simulations to the digital tracing adoption rates reported for different countries. However, the adoption rates cited are typically calculated as numbers of download relative to the population, which is not the same as the fraction of population using the app correctly.</p>
              <p>The adoption rates cited are estimated from application downloads, which can actually represent significant overestimations of the true uptake (this is now apparent in Section 3.4 of the revised text). As to modelling the fraction of the population using the app correctly per se, our simulations should technically rely on the degree of overlap \\Gamma instead of the uptake r. The former, however, was kept to 1 in the digital tracing network, as was correctly observed by the reviewer in the next question.</p>
              <p>8. In Section 3.4, if I understood correctly, the overlap between edges in the digital contact tracing network and the true contact network is assumed to be perfect, while the uptake in the manual tracing network is assumed to be 100%. Both of these assumptions seem overly optimistic to me, e.g., the manual contact tracing system will saturate at a given prevalence as was seen in most western countries, while digital contacts are only proxies for real (possibly disease transmitting) contacts.</p>
              <p>Indeed, we are only varying the overlap for manual tracing and the uptake for digital tracing, but the two parameters are interlinked within a single network (varying one can directly impact the other). That being said, the “uptake” in manual tracing does not have a clear real-life correspondent, unless we are referring to memory-impaired individuals who are unable to identify any of their contacts (but for the purpose of our study we assumed such special circumstances can be covered by the randomness of link removal attributed to diversifying the degree of overlap). In contrast, varying the “overlap” in digital tracing corresponds to inadequate usage patterns of the application, and was made entirely possible in our codebase. However, showcasing the effects of sampling the entire parameter grid becomes combinatorically harder, so we decided to illustrate only a targeted subset of the scenarios our model is actually capable of running. </p>
              <p>8. Please corroborate the claim (on lines 144-146) that the Erdos-Renyi graph model tends to offer acceptable approximations most of the time.</p>
              <p>From [1], the study which introduced the SIRT model we extended, “the epidemic dynamics in SW networks remains qualitatively similar to random graphs, since they possess a well-defined epidemic threshold”. In addition to this, both real networks and ER graphs (under the studied K values) generally exhibit a single giant component, sparse densities, small average shortest paths [3,4]. Even though ER networks make a few unrealistic assumptions about the degree distribution (nodes with too many or too few connections are heavily restricted) and the independence of interactions in closed communities (where some inherent dependence must actually exist), they are still a good tool for modelling infections in randomly mixed populations [5] (e.g. in stores, public transportation etc. [6]). That being said, we do agree our original statement is overly optimistic, and therefore we amended our formulation in the revision.</p>

              <p>8. It seems like an error that symbols in Table 1 are in boldface.</p>
              <p>This was done on purpose to highlight the afferent symbols, but in the new version of the table we removed this styling.</p>
              <p>9. The authors may want to discuss the implications of the crossover effects seen in Fig. 10, i.e., the final outbreak size can be larger for higher uptake.</p>
              <p>A discussion on the rare “crossover effects” has been added to the revised manuscript in Section 3.3. </p>
              <p>10. Can the authors comment on how realistic the required values of \\Gamma and \\tau_t for combined tracing to be effective alone are? Have the values of these parameters been estimated empirically?</p>
              <p>The parameter values we indicated as being “effective” have been estimated empirically through inspecting the simulation results. Unfortunately, it is a rather challenging task to find real-world estimates of either of these two parameters. This is why we conduct an extensive study of the trends emerged from running simulations over a large range of values. The UK government SAGE has recommended that at least 80% of close contacts be reached for the system to be deemed effective – overlap=0.8: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/nhs-test-and-trace-performance-tracker" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/nhs-test-and-trace-performance-tracker</ext-link>. This percentage is highly influenced, however, by the recalled contacts (only 74% provided at least one close contact in the last month) and the possibility to reach those contacts (84% identified and asked to isolate in the last month). This would bring the actual overlap to a value significantly lower than 0.8 (the quoted value of 0.5 being reasonable to assume as possible to achieve).</p>
              <p>11. In Fig. 5 add description of what symbols and boxes and whiskers represent.</p>
              <p>Line 74: Change “SIR” to “The SIR process”</p>
              <p>Line 80: add abbreviation “(Inserm)”</p>
              <p>Line 121: “onto” → “on”</p>
              <p>Lines 140-141: should “scales with” be replaced by “is proportional to”?</p>
              <p>Line 205: Specify what is meant by “meaningful results”.</p>
              <p>Line 212: “N” → “small N”.</p>
              <p>Line 302: “encapsulated” → “model’s”</p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: I apologize for the delay in submitting my report.</p>
              <p>The authors have addressed all my previous criticism in their revision. I am happy to recommend the publication of their paper in PLOS ONE.</p>
              <p>The authors have added a discussion of the modeling assumption that state transitions take place with constant rates (exponentially distributed waiting times). Which is great since this common assumption is often not satisfied in empirical data. However, they discuss only the case where waiting time distributions are less skewed than exponentials. Though they may also be more skewed, notably due to intercontact times and edge weights following heavy-tailed distributions as is often the case in physical proximity networks often (see e.g. Starnini et al. “Modeling human dynamics of face-to-face interaction networks” PRL 2013).</p>
              <p>One has to read Eqs. 1 and 2 to understand how $\\Gamma$ and $r$ are defined, while the definitions of $Z_{rem}$ and $N_{utn}$ are clear from the text. I suggest moving the first part of Eqs. 1 and 2 (before the $\\Rightarrow$ sign) up to where $\\Gamma$ and $r$ are introduced. The second parts of Eqs. 1 and 2 may be removed as they are obtained by a simple arithmetic inversion of the first parts, or the authors may keep them at their current place.</p>
              <p>Change: ‘contacts network’ to ‘contact network’ on page 6 (no line numbering) and on page 7, line 137.</p>
              <p>Change: ‘newly isolated’ to ‘isolated’ on page 6.</p>
              <p>Change: ‘testing regimes’ to ‘testing regime’ in Fig. 7 caption.</p>
              <p>Change: ‘$tau_r$’ to ‘$\\tau_r$’ in line 252.</p>
              <p>Change ‘First aspect’ to ‘The first aspect’ in line 304.</p>
              <p>Change: ‘experiments’ to ‘simulations’ in line 371.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The manuscript presents a compartmental model that can explicitly capture the manual/digital contact tracing and study contact tracing strategies in various situations. Overall, I believe that the work mostly satisfies the publication criteria of PLOS ONE, providing a solid study of the proposed model.</p>
              <p>However, I still have two comments. First, as other reviewers mentioned, the network structure and temporal dynamics are somewhat overlooked in the paper. Although I would not argue that the authors should perform extra simulations, I think it is important to acknowledge it more thoroughly in the discussion. It has been recognized that super-spreading is a rather universal characteristic of many epidemics [1] and COVID-19 is argued to be driven primarily by such super-spreading events. Furthermore, recent studies (e.g., [2]) have shown that when spreading is driven by such super-spreading events, the details of contact tracing implementation may matter a lot. In this context, I believe that the paper should expand the discussion to provide a better context to the readers.</p>
              <p>Second, I think the plots can be improved a lot by carefully choosing colors and by limiting the number of lines/objects that each figure shows. Many figures have numerous (~10) lines with random colors associated with each line, making them very difficult to parse. I believe that most of the figures will not lose much information by reducing the number of lines to ~5. In addition, as each of these lines show a range of parameter values (i.e., they can be ordered), a linear colormap (e.g., sampling colors across the "viridis" colormap) would make them much easier to read. Also, the heatmap figure uses green-to-red colormap, which can be understood by a significant fraction of population who has colorblindness. Furthermore, the colormap used introduces an arbitrary cut-off point (between 750 and 1000) that introduces an artifact. Again, I believe that a linear, perceptually uniform colormap should be used here. Although this is probably not "critical" regarding PLOS ONE's publication criteria, I believe that this simple improvement in the figures will make the paper much more accessible.</p>

              <p>We reverified our References list to ensure no retracted papers got cited. At the same time, we added a few more references to support our discussion on waiting times and network structures, in light of the suggestions made by the reviewers. In addition, we supplemented the information provided for references 5, 6, 10, 16 (previously 15), 17 (previously 16) with links to the corresponding cited web resources.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions when using PACE, please email PLOS at <email>figures@plos.org</email>. Please note that Supporting Information files do not need this step.</p>
              <p>All our figures have been verified using the PACE system, and no issues were reported, except for Fig8.eps in which the tool detected bitmap images with resolution &lt; 300 DPI. We have inspected the apparently-problematic figure but found no issues with its rendering. Please also note that most of our figures were regenerated using a different colormap in light of the comments made by Reviewer #3, and adequate margins have now been added.</p>
              <p>Replies to Reviewer #2</p>
              <p>1. The authors have added a discussion of the modeling assumption that state transitions take place with constant rates (exponentially distributed waiting times). Which is great since this common assumption is often not satisfied in empirical data. However, they discuss only the case where waiting time distributions are less skewed than exponentials. Though they may also be more skewed, notably due to intercontact times and edge weights following heavy-tailed distributions as is often the case in physical proximity networks often (see e.g. Starnini et al. “Modeling human dynamics of face-to-face interaction networks” PRL 2013).</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that intercontact times may often be gracefully modelled via heavier-tailed distributions, such as power laws. We have now added a comment on this aspect in the manuscript. The decision we took for our contact tracing model was based on the findings of 2 cohort studies that reported exponential decays in the number of interaction events over time, while also having in mind the fact that this is a very common assumption in the epidemiological literature. The work of Starnini et al. [1] found power laws to be excellent approximators for the contact duration, but a power law fit to waiting times was found to be moderately less optimal, as the authors remark themselves. We would also like to emphasize that the figures presented in the aforementioned study utilize a log-log scale, which may sometimes hide exponential trends. In fact, the authors of this paper do not provide the parameters for the fitted power law to the intercontact times (although they do so for contact duration), so it is harder to judge the extent of the inferred exponent. At the same time, the fitted curve exhibits a concave curvature in the log-log plot, which may actually correspond to a roughly-exponential trend if translated to a linear scale. Sadly, no comparison with an exponential fit is provided in this text either. We acknowledge, however, that some interaction datasets do feature more skewed waiting times distributions than Gamma, and hence we believe that exploring the impact of utilizing longer-tailed distributions is an interesting avenue worth exploring in future endeavors.</p>

              <p>2. One has to read Eqs. 1 and 2 to understand how $\\Gamma$ and $r$ are defined, while the definitions of $Z_{rem}$ and $N_{utn}$ are clear from the text. I suggest moving the first part of Eqs. 1 and 2 (before the $\\Rightarrow$ sign) up to where $\\Gamma$ and $r$ are introduced. The second parts of Eqs. 1 and 2 may be removed as they are obtained by a simple arithmetic inversion of the first parts, or the authors may keep them at their current place.</p>
              <p>Thank you for suggesting this easier-to-comprehend rephrasing and reordering of Section 2.2 and its equations. The manuscript has been amended to include in-line equations for all the network parameters involved, while full equations for $N_{utn}$ and $N_{ute}$ have been provided below.</p>
              <p>3. Change: ‘contacts network’ to ‘contact network’ on page 6 (no line numbering) and on page 7, line 137. Change: ‘newly isolated’ to ‘isolated’ on page 6.</p>
              <p>Change: ‘testing regimes’ to ‘testing regime’ in Fig. 7 caption.</p>
              <p>Change: ‘$tau_r$’ to ‘$\\tau_r$’ in line 252.</p>
              <p>Change ‘First aspect’ to ‘The first aspect’ in line 304.</p>
              <p>Change: ‘experiments’ to ‘simulations’ in line 371.</p>
              <p>Thank you for signaling these difficult-to-spot phrasing issues and mistakes. These suggestions have now been accommodated in the final manuscript.</p>
              <p>Replies to Reviewer #3</p>
              <p>1. First, as other reviewers mentioned, the network structure and temporal dynamics are somewhat overlooked in the paper. Although I would not argue that the authors should perform extra simulations, I think it is important to acknowledge it more thoroughly in the discussion. It has been recognized that super-spreading is a rather universal characteristic of many epidemics [1] and COVID-19 is argued to be driven primarily by such super-spreading events. Furthermore, recent studies (e.g., [2]) have shown that when spreading is driven by such super-spreading events, the details of contact tracing implementation may matter a lot. In this context, I believe that the paper should expand the discussion to provide a better context to the readers.</p>

              <p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that our discussion on superspreading, a very important mechanism underpinning the spread of COVID-19, was minimal in the previous submission. As such, we have now included a larger paragraph on superspreading, preferential attachment and small-world networks (see Section 2.3). In the same section, we have also commented on why we believe our contact tracing modelling technique remains suitable in the face of challenges like superspreading in scale-free networks or large clustering coefficients in small-world graphs, taking into consideration the findings of Kojaku et al. [1] and Tsimring and Huerta [2], respectively, as well as the similarities between our modelling technique and theirs. </p>

              <p>2. Second, I think the plots can be improved a lot by carefully choosing colors and by limiting the number of lines/objects that each figure shows. Many figures have numerous (~10) lines with random colors associated with each line, making them very difficult to parse. I believe that most of the figures will not lose much information by reducing the number of lines to ~5. In addition, as each of these lines show a range of parameter values (i.e., they can be ordered), a linear colormap (e.g., sampling colors across the "viridis" colormap) would make them much easier to read. Also, the heatmap figure uses green-to-red colormap, which can be understood by a significant fraction of population who has colorblindness. Furthermore, the colormap used introduces an arbitrary cut-off point (between 750 and 1000) that introduces an artifact. Again, I believe that a linear, perceptually uniform colormap should be used here. Although this is probably not "critical" regarding PLOS ONE's publication criteria, I believe that this simple improvement in the figures will make the paper much more accessible.</p>
              <p>Indeed, the original color schemes used for our plots were sometimes counterintuitive and probably difficult to comprehend for people with color blindness. To fix this issue, we have regenerated all our charts, including the heatmaps, using the linear colormap ‘inferno’. What is more, we have also reduced the number of lines in all the overlap/uptake figures to a maximum of 7 different rates, thus making them more comprehendible.</p>
