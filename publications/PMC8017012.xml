                <p id="Par1">We present different data analytic methodologies that have been applied in order to understand the evolution of the first wave of the Coronavirus disease 2019 in the Republic of Cyprus and the effect of different intervention measures that have been taken by the government. Change point detection has been used in order to estimate the number and locations of changes in the behaviour of the collected data. Count time series methods have been employed to provide short term projections and a number of various compartmental models have been fitted to the data providing with long term projections on the pandemic’s evolution and allowing for the estimation of the effective reproduction number.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infection caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> that first emerged in Wuhan, China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> , by the beginning of February 2021, counts more than 105 million cases and has claimed nearly 2,300,000 lives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Despite some advances in therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and some vaccines receiving conditional approval<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, there are still many gaps in our understanding of the dynamics of the new pandemic disease, of the effect of the interventions different governments have imposed, and of a number of other epidemiological parameters. Epidemic modeling is a fundamental component of epidemiology, especially with regards to infectious diseases. Following the pioneering work of R. Ross, W. Kermack, and McKendrick in early twentieth century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, the discipline has established itself and comprises a major source of information for decision makers. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the Scientific Advisory Group of Emergencies (SAGE) is a major body that collects evidence from multiple sources including inputs from mathematical modeling to advise the British government on its response to the complex COVID-19 situation; for more information see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/scientific-evidence-supporting-the-government-response-to-coronavirus-covid-19">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/scientific-evidence-supporting-the-government-response-to-coronavirus-covid-19</ext-link>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, expert opinions can help decision makers comprehend the status of the pandemic by collecting, analyzing, and interpreting relevant data and developing scientifically sound methods and models. An exact model that would describe perfectly the data is usually not feasible and of limited scope; hence scientists usually aim for models that allow a statistical simulation of synthetic data. At the same time, models can also approximate the dynamics of the disease and discover important patterns in the data. In this way, researchers can study various scenarios and understand the likely consequences of government interventions.</p>
              <p id="Par4">The Republic of Cyprus is an island-state, located in the Mediterranean in the southeast of Europe. The first (imported) cases of COVID-19 appeared in early March 2020 with the first wave peaking in late March-early April. The health authorities responded rapidly and rigorously to the COVID-19 pandemic by scaling-up testing, increasing efforts to trace and isolate contacts of cases, and implementing measures such as closures of educational institutions, and travel and movement restrictions. Lacking a scientific unit specialised in epidemics and other infectious health hazards, a diverse group of experts from various disciplines, including epidemiologists, clinicians, statisticians and data scientists was formed with the aim of trying to understand the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Cyprus and of assisting the Cypriot government in informed decision making. This manuscript contains the work of this group, including results from statistical and mathematical models used to understand the epidemiology of the first wave of COVID-19 in Cyprus, which spans from the beginning of March till the end of May 2020. Specifically, we proposed a range of different models that captured different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis consisted of several methods applied to understand the evolution of pandemics in the long and short run. We used change-point detection, count time series methods and compartmental models for short and long term projections, respectively. We estimated the effective reproduction number by using three different methods and obtained consistent results across all the used methods. Results were cross-validated against observed data. Besides providing a comprehensive data analysis, we illustrate the importance of mathematical models to epidemiology.</p>

              <title>Cyprus COVID-19 surveillance system</title>
              <p id="Par5">The Unit for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (USCCD) of the Ministry of Health operates COVID-19 surveillance. The lab-based surveillance system consisted, during the first pandemic wave, of 19 laboratories (7 public and 12 private) that carried out molecular diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2. Sociodemographic, epidemiological, and clinical data of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection were routinely collected from laboratories and clinics, and reported to an electronic platform of the USCCD. A confirmed COVID-19 case was a person, symptomatic or asymptomatic, with a respiratory swab (nasopharynx and/or pharynx) positive for SARS-CoV-2 by a real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) assay. Cases were considered imported if they had travel history from an affected area within 14 days of the disease onset. Locally-acquired cases were individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and had the earliest onset date in Cyprus without travel history from affected areas. People with symptomatic COVID-19 were considered recovered after the resolution of symptoms and two negative tests for SARS-CoV-2 at least 24-h apart from each other. For asymptomatic cases, the negative tests to document virus clearance were obtained at least 14 days after the initial positive test. A person with a positive test at 14 days was further isolated for one week and finally released at 21 days after the initial diagnosis without further laboratory tests. Testing approaches in the Republic of Cyprus included: (a) targeted testing of suspect cases and their contacts; of repatriates at the airport and during their 14-day quarantine; of teachers and students when schools re-opened in mid-May; of employees in essential services that continued their operation throughout the first pandemic wave (e.g. customer services, public domain, etc); and of health-care workers in public hospitals, and (b) population screenings following random sampling in the general population of most districts and in two municipalities with increased disease burden. By June 2nd 2020, 120,298 PCR tests had been performed (13,734.2 per 100,000 population). Public health measures were taken in 4 phases: Period 1 (10–14 March, 2020) included closures of educational institutions and cancellation of public gatherings (&gt; 75 persons); Period 2 (15–23 March, 2020) involved closure of entertainment areas (for instance, malls, theatres, etc), allowance of 1 person per 8 square meters in public service areas, and restrictions to international travel (for example, access to the Republic of Cyprus was permitted only for specific persons and after SARS-CoV-2 testing); Period 3 (24–30 March, 2020) included closure of most retail services; and Period 4 (31 March–3 May) included the suspension of incoming flights with few exceptions (for instance, repatriated Cypriot citizens), stay at home order, and night curfew.</p>

                <title>Change-point analysis and projections</title>
                <p id="Par7">Change-point detection is an active area of statistical research that has attracted a lot of interest in recent years and plays an essential role in the development of the mathematical sciences. A non-exhaustive list of application areas includes financial econometrics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, credit scoring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and bioinformatics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The focus is on the so-called <italic>a posteriori</italic> change-point detection, where the aim is to estimate the number and locations of certain changes in the behaviour of a given data sequence. For a review of methods of inference for single and multiple change-points (especially in the context of time series) under the a-posteriori framework, see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Detecting these change-points enables data segmentation to homogeneous parts thus leading to a more elaborate modeling approach. Advantages of discovering such segments include interpretation and forecasting. Interpretation naturally associates the detected change-points to real-life events or/and political decisions. In this way, improved description of the observed process and the impact of any intervention can be communicated. With regards to forecasting, the role of the final segment is quite important as it allows for a more accurate prediction of future values of the data sequence at hand. Methods developed in this context are based on a given model.

The basic assumptions for these models are the existence of a closed community, i.e. without influx of new susceptibles or mortality due to other causes, with a fixed population, say <italic>N</italic>, and also that the individuals who recover from the illness are immune and do not become susceptible again. In the basic SEIR model, at any point in time <italic>t</italic>, each individual is either susceptible (<italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)), exposed (<italic>E</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)), infectious (<italic>I</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)) or recovered (<italic>R</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), including death).

                <p id="Par30">This method has detected three important changes. The first change occurs on the 23rd of March, while the last two changes are estimated on the 2nd and 17th of April. The first change-point, on the 23rd of March, indicates a significant increase in the number of cases, and it is believed to be related to the development of the clusters A and B as mentioned in the Descriptive surveillance statistics section. The second change-point shows that the upward trend vanishes and a negative slope takes its place leading to a vast decrease in the number of cases. There is a connection of this change point with the Government’s lockdown decrees on the 24th and 31st of March; it shows the almost immediate impact that such decisions can have in fighting the pandemic. The third change-point indicates stabilisation in the number of the detected cases over the last period. The median for the number of cases in the last segment is equal to 3. Predictions (together with 95% CI.) for the week ahead are also shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. Note that there will be no more than 8 cases on the 1st of June and no more than 9 cases per day in the period from the 2nd of the month until the 7th. The point estimator is found to be equal to 2 cases per day. The corresponding analysis for the piecewise-constant signal plus noise model is given in Online Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A5</xref>. Both models describe adequately the daily number of cases and (a) they provide a justification of the positive impact of the Government’s measures in fighting COVID-19, (b) they give a clear view of how contagious the virus is, especially in cases when hubs are developed in the society, and (c) the last homogeneous discovered segment provides better understanding of the current state of the virus in terms of its transmittal.</p>

              <p id="Par41">The work presented in this report is the result of the efforts of the authors to give guidance to the Cypriot government for controlling the COVID-19 infection outbreak. Different models and methods have been applied to the data collected by the Unit for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases of the Cypriot Ministry of Health.</p>
              <p id="Par42">Change point detection has been used in order to estimate the number and locations of changes in the behaviour of data. Three important changes have been detected. The first one indicated a significant increase in the number of cases, that we suspect is related to the formation of two clusters of COVID-19 infection cases, while the other two indicate a drop and stabilisation respectively in the numbers of cases that are probably linked to the effectiveness of the Government’s lockdown decrees. A log-linear model with feedback and additive outliers was utilised to examine the existence of interventions resulting in two cases. Both methods were subsequently used to provide with prediction intervals on the number of future numbers of diagnoses with comparable results.</p>
              <p id="Par43">Modifications of the SEIR model have been employed in order to study the long-term impact of the COVID-19 to Cyprus. As expected, the fitting improved once enough data were available, with a very good agreement to the observations. Using the fitted Model 3 it was possible to additionally estimate the number of unobserved exposed and infectious cases during the pandemic, with the maximum number of infectious individuals being reached on the 26th of March. Moreover the SEIR based Models 1 and 2 facilitated the estimation and prediction of the effective reproduction number. The estimation was performed in a Bayesian framework during consecutive time periods for which the effective reproduction number was considered constant. We have treated two separate cases: in the first, there was no distinction between the patients while in the second we have considered only those patients resulting from local transmission. Finally, we have estimated the effective reproduction number for a partition of the population according to the five geographic areas of Cyprus.</p>
