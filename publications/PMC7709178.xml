              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P6">Despite unprecedented movement restrictions, social distancing measures, and stay-at-home orders enacted in many countries [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the COVID-19 pandemic has caused devastating morbidity and mortality. However, the vast majority of the global population remains susceptible to COVID-19, highlighting the need for an effective vaccine. To mitigate the mounting burden of COVID-19, vaccine development has occurred at an unprecedented pace [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As of December 31, 2020, safety and efficacy results for a number of vaccines have been reported [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and Phase III clinical trials for several other candidates are underway [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P7">Results from two large efficacy trials (Pfizer - BioNTech, Moderna) indicate a vaccine efficacy of over 90% against symptomatic and severe disease [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], exceeding the preferred population-based efficacy specified by the World Health Organization [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These vaccines have received emergency use authorization by the FDA [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and vaccination has already started in the US with prioritization of healthcare workers, long-term care residents, and high-risk individuals. This compels an urgent need to understand the potential population-level impact of vaccination on COVID-19 transmission and disease outcomes.</p>
              <p id="P8">Implementation of vaccination programs will likely take several months, depending on the ability to roll out clinics and security of vaccine supply in each state. To project the impact of vaccination and roll-out during ongoing outbreaks, we developed an age-structured transmission model, taking into account comorbidities and demographics of the US population [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We explored a strategy where healthcare workers and high-risk individuals, including those with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and individuals aged 65 and older, were prioritized for vaccination. This prioritization relies on the evidence that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing health conditions, including diabetes and hypertension, are 2–4 times more likely to develop severe disease than those without comorbidities [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, severity of symptoms and risk of death increase precipitously with age [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For sensitivity analyses, we varied vaccine efficacy against infection, vaccine coverage, and the level of pre-existing immunity in the population.</p>

                <title>Model structure</title>
                <p id="P9">We extended a previously developed agent-based COVID-19 transmission model to include vaccination [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The model encapsulates the natural history of COVID-19 with classes of individuals including: susceptible; vaccinated; latently infected (not yet infectious); asymptomatic (and infectious); pre-symptomatic (and infectious); symptomatic with either mild or severe/critical illness; recovered; and dead (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We stratified the population into six age groups of 0–4, 5–19, 20–49, 50–64, 65–79, and 80+ years based on US demographics [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], in addition to the age-specific prevalence of comorbidities (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table A1</xref>) [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The number of daily contacts for each individual was sampled from a negative-binomial distribution [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with age-dependent mean and standard deviation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables A2</xref>). These contacts were then distributed across age groups using an empirically-determined contact network [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>

                <p id="P10">Disease transmission was implemented probabilistically for contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals in asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, or symptomatic stages of the disease. Based on the number of secondary cases generated during each stage of the disease [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], infectivity of mild and severe symptomatic stages was parameterized to be 44% and 89%, relative to the pre-symptomatic stage [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The infectivity of asymptomatic infection was assumed to be 26% relative to symptomatic infection, based on an average estimated 3.85 times higher incidence among close contacts of a symptomatic case compared to those of an asymptomatic individual [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Disease-specific parameters were sampled for each individual from their associated distributions and ranges. If infection occurred, the incubation period was sampled from a Gamma distribution with a mean of 5.2 days [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A proportion of infected individuals develop symptoms after a highly infectious pre-symptomatic stage [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The duration of the pre-symptomatic stage was sampled from a Gamma distribution with a mean of 2.3 days [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The infectious period following the onset of symptoms was sampled from a Gamma distribution with a mean of 3.2 days [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Symptomatic cases had an age-dependent probability of developing mild or severe/critical illness. The remaining proportion of infected individuals were asymptomatic after the latent period until recovery, with an infectious period that was sampled from a Gamma distribution with a mean of 5 days [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

                <title>Vaccination</title>
                <p id="P12">We implemented a two-dose vaccination campaign achieving 40% coverage of the entire population within 284 days. We assumed that 70% was the maximum achievable coverage in any age group, with an age-dependent distribution similar to seasonal influenza vaccination in the US [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Vaccines were prioritized to the following groups sequentially: (i) healthcare workers (5% of the total population [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]), adults with comorbidities, and those aged 65 and older (i.e., protection cohort); and (ii) all other individuals aged 18–64 (i.e., disruption minimization cohort) [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Comorbidities included cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and cancer [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Pre-existing immunity or contemporaneous infection with COVID-19 was not a factor in vaccine allocation. The age-specific coverage resulting from this prioritization was 48% of those aged 18–49, 48% of those aged 50–64, and 70% of those aged 65+. We specified a roll-out strategy in which 30 individuals per 10,000 population would be vaccinated per day, corresponding to 6.93 million vaccine doses per week for the entire US population, for approximately 41 weeks. Vaccination occurred during this time period to reach 40% coverage and outcomes were evaluated for 300 days. Infection dynamics continued during the simulations for susceptible and vaccinated individuals.</p>
                <p id="P13">We included a 21-day interval between the first and second vaccine doses [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The vaccine efficacy (<italic toggle="yes">V</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">e</italic></sub>) against symptomatic and severe disease was assumed to be 52%, 14 days after the first dose, and 95%, 1 week after the second dose [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the absence of data for vaccine efficacy against infection or transmission, we assumed that the vaccine protection against infection was 50% lower than its efficacy against disease (base-case), with additional scenarios of (i) 0%; and (ii) the same efficacy against disease, after each dose of the vaccine. We further simulated the model for these scenarios with a 28-day interval between the two doses [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
                <p id="P14">Vaccine efficacy against infection was implemented as a reduction in the probability of transmission when a vaccinated individual encountered an infectious individual. This efficacy was reduced by a factor of <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> in vaccinated individuals with any comorbidities or in persons older than 65 years of age, where <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> was sampled uniformly from the 10–50% range for each individual. This parameterization was based on observed reductions in influenza vaccine effectiveness among frail and comorbid individuals [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For these individuals, we also assumed that vaccine efficacy against disease was reduced by the same factor <italic toggle="yes">q</italic>, if infection occurred post-vaccination, thereby affecting hospitalization and death rates. As a sensitivity analysis, we considered vaccination scenarios without reduction of vaccine efficacy in these individuals. The immunity conferred by vaccination or infection was assumed to last longer than one year (i.e., beyond the simulation timelines).</p>

                <p id="P15">In the base-case scenario, we assumed a 10% level of pre-existing immunity in the population at the onset of simulations, within the range of estimates provided in recent seroprevalence studies [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In scenario analysis, 5% pre-existing immunity was considered to represent regions that have not yet been substantially affected by COVID-19 outbreaks, and alternatively 20% pre-existing immunity was used to represent the expectation that immunity will continue to accrue prior to vaccine availability. To accurately capture the age distribution of population immunity, the model was simulated in the absence of vaccination in an entirely susceptible population. Then, the infection rates in different age groups were derived when the overall attack rate reached 5%, 10%, and 20%, and the corresponding distributions were used as the starting population for the vaccination model (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table A3</xref>).

Simulations were seeded with three initial cases in the pre-symptomatic stage in a population of 10,000 individuals (a scalable size in agent-based modelling) for different levels of herd immunity, and the results averaged over 1000 independent Monte-Carlo realizations, which was sufficient for stabilization. Credible intervals (CrI) were obtained using the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method.

                <p id="P18">Vaccination with 10% pre-existing immunity, even with a 10–50% reduction of vaccine efficacy in elderly and comorbid individuals, substantially mitigated the attack rate across all age groups (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), with a mean overall attack rate of 4.6% (95% CrI: 4.3% – 5.0%) on day 300 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Achieving approximately 50% reduction compared to the no vaccination scenario, the vaccination program would avert 435 (95% CrI: 371 – 494) infections per 10,000 people over 300 days from the start of vaccine distribution. The attack rate was most substantially reduced among individuals aged 65+, by 54–62% (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Although no children under 18 years of age were vaccinated in this model, the attack rate among those under 20 years of age was reduced by at least 36%, largely driven by indirect protection and reduced incidence among adults. Sensitivity analyses for attack rates corresponding to 5% and 20% pre-existing immunity also revealed significant decreases attributed to vaccination across all age groups, but the impact of vaccination was reduced at higher levels of pre-existing immunity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P19">When vaccine efficacy in elderly and comorbid individuals was the same as in other subpopulations, vaccination led to a higher decrease in attack rates across all age groups (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). In this scenario, the comparative advantage of vaccination in reducing incidence and the overall attack rate was diminished as the level of pre-existing immunity in the population increased (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P20">We observed that, in the absence of vaccination, the daily incidence remained above 1 per 10,000 population for at least 288 days (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). However, vaccination with 40% coverage reduced the outbreak peak and led to a daily incidence below 1 case 2–3 months earlier, within 203 – 222 days from the start of vaccination. This earlier control of the outbreak in the base-case scenario with 10% pre-existing immunity was also observed at other levels of pre-existing immunity (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

                <p id="P21">In the absence of vaccination, and with 10% pre-existing immunity, total non-ICU and ICU hospitalizations were projected to be 20.3 (95% CrI: 19.0 – 21.4) and 9.3 (95% CrI: 8.7 – 9.9) per 10,000 population, respectively, with 2.3 (95% CrI: 2.1 – 2.4) deaths per 10,000 population on day 300 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P22">Vaccination with reduced efficacy in elderly and comorbid individuals still markedly reduced hospitalizations and deaths (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Non-ICU hospitalizations, ICU hospitalizations, and deaths would be reduced by 63.5% (95% CrI: 60.3% – 66.7%), 65.6% (95% CrI: 62.2% – 68.6%), and 69.3% (95% CrI: 65.5% – 73.1%), respectively, over 300 days from the start of vaccination. We projected that vaccination would lead to higher reductions in hospitalizations and deaths for 5% pre-existing immunity. However, vaccine attributable reductions in non-ICU hospitalizations, ICU hospitalizations, and deaths were lower with 20% pre-existing immunity, and were projected to be 59.5% (95% CrI: 55.8% – 62.9%), 59.5% (95% CrI: 55.6% – 63.0%), and 61.6% (95% CrI: 57.0% – 66.2%), respectively (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). If vaccine efficacy was not reduced in elderly and comorbid individuals, the effect of vaccination in reducing hospitalizations and deaths was increased.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P24">COVID-19 outbreaks have caused significant global morbidity and mortality, in addition to undermining the economic and social well-being of individuals and communities. Despite this devastating toll, the majority of the population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Thus, vaccine development has been a high priority. The scale and speed of vaccine development efforts have been unprecedented, and highly protective vaccines are beginning to be distributed. This study shows that COVID-19 vaccines with 95% efficacy in preventing disease, even if they conferred limited protection against infection, could substantially mitigate future attack rates, hospitalizations, and deaths.</p>
              <p id="P25">Our findings should be interpreted within study assumptions and limitations. First, our model vaccinated a large proportion of high-risk individuals, including 70% of healthcare workers [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and 56% of comorbid individuals. Although this coverage may be difficult to achieve in the short term [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], strategic public health campaigns and transparent communication regarding vaccine safety may be able to improve uptake. Second, we assumed that all vaccinated individuals were willing to receive both doses. If substantial drop-out occurs after the first dose, vaccines could be used more quickly for the general population, and the short-term effect of drop-outs may be minor. Third, the daily number of contacts in the model was age-dependent without consideration of the location of occurrence (e.g., within households, workplaces, and schools). However, this is not expected to change our community-based results, since model calibration would modulate the transmission probability for a given reproduction number. Similarly, any reduction of contacts and variation in contact patterns are accounted for in the calibration process when transmission probability is determined. Finally, the model did not explicitly simulate other mitigation measures (e.g., social distancing, mask-wearing, testing, and contact tracing); however, we calibrated the model to current estimates of the effective reproduction number to account for known compliance with such measures in the US. Further studies are needed to determine the vaccine coverage required to eliminate the need for non-pharmaceutical interventions.</p>
              <p id="P26">Given the limited population-level immunity to COVID-19 [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], vaccination remains a key preventive measure to reduce disease burden and mitigate future outbreaks. Our study suggests that a vaccine could have a substantial impact on reducing incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths, especially among vulnerable individuals with comorbidities and risk factors associated with severe COVID-19. Thus, mobilizing public health resources is imperative to achieve the proposed goal of distributing 100 million vaccine doses over 100 days in the US population by the incoming administration [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Our findings support the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], highlighting that a targeted vaccination strategy can effectively mitigate disease burden and the societal impact of COVID-19. We also find that, even with the relatively rapid roll-out simulated here, it may take several months to control COVID-19 at the population level. Moreover, this impact is achieved in the context of continued public health efforts, and is not possible without diligent attention to the other aspects of infection prevention and control such as masking, hand hygiene, testing, contact-tracing, and isolation of infected cases. If current vaccination programs are accompanied by widespread relaxation of other measures, a much higher coverage will be necessary with a significantly higher distribution capacity. Nevertheless, our results are an encouraging signal of the power and promise of vaccines against COVID-19.</p>
