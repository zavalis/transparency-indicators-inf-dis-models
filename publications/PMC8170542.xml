                <title>Key Points</title>
                <sec id="ab-zoi210319-1">
                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>What is the association of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and coverage scenarios with and without nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) with SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths?</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="ab-zoi210319-2">
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>A decision analytical model of North Carolina found that removing NPIs while vaccines were distributed resulted in substantial increases in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, as NPIs were removed, higher vaccination coverage with less efficacious vaccines contributed to a larger reduction in risk of infection compared with more efficacious vaccines at lower coverage.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="ab-zoi210319-3">

              <p>SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will play a major role in achieving sufficient population immunity to end the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In May 2020, the US Department of Health and Human Services launched Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership with the goal of administering 300 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine by January 2021.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, with an estimated 16 billion doses required to meet global demand, mass vaccination campaigns across the world will be unprecedented.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In December 2020, the Moderna<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and Pfizer-BioNTech<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> messenger RNA vaccines were authorized for emergency use, with more expected to follow in 2021.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although the primary end point of COVID-19 vaccine trials is efficacy to prevent severe disease and death, these vaccines are expected to reduce transmission and contribute to population immunity required to end the pandemic.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Recent mathematical modeling suggests that prioritizing vaccine distribution and uptake would maximize the benefit of a highly efficacious vaccine.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Bartsch et al<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> estimated that at least 75% of the US population would need to be vaccinated with an efficacy of 70% to reduce the epidemic peak by more than 99% without other interventions. Considering the complexities of large-scale vaccine production, distribution, and uptake, achieving high coverage will be challenging.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Therefore, critical questions remain regarding the need to continue nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as physical distancing and use of face masks, as the public is vaccinated over time.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission that capture complex and heterogeneous interactions between individuals are needed to understand the dynamics between COVID-19 vaccination strategies and other behavioral interventions.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Using an integrated compartmental disease transmission model and agent-based simulation,<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> we estimated the effect of hypothetical scenarios of vaccine efficacy and population coverage on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19–related hospitalizations and deaths. Simulating vaccine distribution in North Carolina, we compared the outcomes of varying efficacy and coverage with NPIs maintained and removed concurrently with vaccine distribution. To explore meaningful differences between subpopulations, we stratified the results by race/ethnicity and urban, suburban, and rural communities. These objectives were informed by state and local public health decision-makers involved in the COVID-19 response.</p>

                <p>The North Carolina population of 10 490 000, which consists of 2195 census tracts, was modeled with 1 017 720 agents. The simulation was seeded (day 1) with cumulative infections as of March 24, 2020,<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> with the laboratory-confirmed cases multiplied by a factor of 10 to account for limited testing and underreporting<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> to approximate the true number of infections. This number was then scaled to the number of agents in the simulation. The simulation spanned 18 months (548 days; from March 24, 2020, to September 23, 2021) to evaluate the association of vaccination scenarios with key outcomes for the current pandemic. Model outcomes were scaled back to the total North Carolina population. The model was calibrated and validated using the number of laboratory-confirmed cases and reported deaths as of November 1, 2020 (eMethods and eTable 2 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI210319-1-s">Supplement</xref>). County-specific cases were randomly distributed to households across the county’s tracts proportionally to the tract population. For each simulated scenario, 45 replications were performed. A different seed population (ie, agent demographic characteristics and who they interact with and where) was selected for each replication and accounts for variation across replications. For subgroup analyses, simulation results were stratified by race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black or African American, and Hispanic). Results were not reported for other races, such as Asian, Native American, and multiracial, because of small denominators. We stratified by urban, suburban, and rural tracts defined by rural-urban commuting area codes (1-2, 3-5, and 6-10, respectively).</p>

                <title>COVID-19 Vaccination</title>
                <p>In simulations, vaccines were distributed uniformly to adults (20 years and older) during a 6-month period. We simulated scenarios in which vaccine distribution started when 10% of the state had been infected (day 213). Three vaccine coverage scenarios achieved 25%, 50%, and 75% of adults vaccinated by the end of the 6-month distribution period. Vaccine distribution ramped up with 50% of the final coverage distributed in the first 4 months and 50% distributed in the last 2 months. Vaccine efficacy was modeled as the probability that a vaccinated, susceptible agent directly transitions to the recovered state. In this model, as with individuals who recover from infection, vaccinated individuals who transition permanently remain recovered. We assumed the vaccine conferred immunity immediately. Vaccine efficacies tested were 90%, based on preliminary estimates of vaccine efficacy from phase 3 trials, and 50%, based on the minimum efficacy threshold established by the US Food and Drug Administration. We simulated the 2 efficacy levels and 3 coverage levels, resulting in 6 vaccination scenarios (A-F), the best case being 90% efficacy with 75% coverage (A), and the worst case being 50% efficacy with 25% coverage (F). In addition, we simulated a no-vaccine scenario (G) to provide context.</p>

Data reflected the stay-at-home order in place from March 24 to May 8, 2020, for nonessential workers as well as reductions in distancing over time. We also modeled voluntary isolation and quarantine where an agent with symptomatic infection isolated at home with all members of the household until the agent recovered. Based on mobility data and computational experiments, this scenario occurred with 60% probability initially and then decreased by 15 percentage points each week until reaching 15%, where it remained for the duration of the simulation.</p>
                <p>Use of face masks among agents began at 0 and increased at a constant rate to 70% when face masks were mandated statewide in June.

                <p>All vaccination scenarios with NPIs had lower risks than without NPI counterparts; these differences tended to increase with lower vaccine efficacy and coverage. Maintaining NPIs with the worst-case vaccination scenario (F1) reduced infections by a mean (SD) of 15% (1%) compared with this scenario without NPIs (F0). In contrast, the mean (SD) risk reductions for scenarios A1 and A0 were similar at 19% (1%) vs 18% (1%), suggesting that NPIs had a smaller association with outcomes in best-case vaccination. Similar patterns for the joint association of vaccination and NPIs were observed for mortality risks and hospitalizations. A mean (SD) of 15 166 (589) deaths, accounting for 0.1% of the population, resulted from worst-case vaccination without NPIs (F0), whereas best-case vaccination with NPIs (A1) resulted in a mean (SD) of 6789 (450) total deaths (<xref rid="zoi210319t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>Cumulative incidences of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths by scenario varied across racial/ethnic groups (eTable 3 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI210319-1-s">Supplement</xref>). White individuals had the lowest incidence of infections, whereas Hispanic individuals had the lowest hospitalization and mortality rates. Black individuals tended to have the highest incidence of infections, hospitalizations, and mortality. The mean (SD) reduction with best-case vaccination and maintaining NPIs (scenarios A1 vs F0) was greater among White and Black individuals (−82 [6] and −82 [10], respectively, per 100 000) compared with Hispanic individuals (−72 [14] per 100 000) (<xref rid="zoi210319t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This trend in mortality reduction between racial/ethnic groups was generally consistent for each vaccination-NPI scenario according to difference-in-differences analyses.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our study suggests that, for a population of 10.5 million, approximately 1.8 million infections and 8000 deaths could be prevented during 11 months with more efficacious COVID-19 vaccines, higher vaccination coverage, and maintaining NPIs, such as distancing and use of face masks. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of continued adherence to NPIs while the population is vaccinated, particularly under scenarios of lower vaccine efficacy and coverage. Maintaining NPIs throughout the 6-month vaccine distribution period appeared to reduce infections to levels seen at the beginning of the pandemic. In contrast, under scenarios with low vaccine efficacy and coverage, premature removal of NPIs could result in a resurgence of infections with a magnitude exceeding that before vaccine distribution.</p>
              <p>While initial vaccine trials have demonstrated 95% efficacy to reduce symptomatic infections,<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> the ability of immunization to prevent asymptomatic infection and transmission is not well understood.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Furthermore, protection may be limited in those who miss a booster dose or if a new strain of the virus with antibody resistance emerges.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Therefore, a universal vaccine efficacy of 90% modeled in our study is likely to be overly optimistic. Similarly, vaccinating at least 75% of the adult population during 6 months, as modeled in our study, will be challenging given issues surrounding vaccine supply, distribution, and hesitancy.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Thus, although the differences between the number of infections in the best-case vaccination scenario with and without NPIs were smaller than in other scenarios, achieving 90% efficacy and 75% coverage may not be realistic, emphasizing the need for continued NPI adherence.</p>
              <p>Consistent with prior studies,<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> our findings suggest that higher vaccine coverage (ie, 75% vs 25%) could lead to a comparatively greater reduction of infections than higher vaccine efficacy (ie, 90% vs 50%) when NPIs are relaxed. Currently, a strategy of reducing the number of doses of the messenger RNA vaccines to increase the vaccine supply and vaccinate more people is being debated.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Although coverage is a function of vaccine supply, distribution, and uptake, it was only considered broadly in our study. Furthermore, the vaccine was distributed throughout the population uniformly rather than by priority groups. Comparing the scenarios with 90% efficacy and 25% coverage with those with 50% efficacy and 50% coverage, in which coverage is doubled, we observed minimal differences in risk of new infections and COVID-19–associated hospitalizations and deaths.</p>
              <p>For SARS-CoV-2, the threshold for herd immunity is estimated at 58% for an R<sub>0</sub> of 2.4, although depending on population characteristics and virus transmission dynamics,<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> estimates can range from 43% to 90%.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> We found that sufficient population protection to slow new infections was achieved through vaccination during 6 months and NPIs, although removing NPIs during vaccination distribution was associated with additional hospitalizations and deaths. Our findings suggest that coordinated efforts are needed to maximize vaccine coverage and adherence to NPIs to reduce COVID-19 burden to a level that could safely allow a resumption of many economic, educational, and social activities.</p>
              <p>We found disparities in COVID-19 mortality by race/ethnicity consistent with prior findings that Black/African American individuals are at higher risk of hospitalization and death.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> In our model, these disparities were partly explained by diabetes as a risk factor for hospitalization and were likely underestimated because we did not account for other high-risk conditions as well as the adverse effects of structural racism.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> We also found higher rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations and mortality in rural compared with urban communities. We did not account for the potential for hospitals or intensive care units to become overburdened, so deaths could be greater than estimated, particularly in rural areas. Assuming vaccine distribution is uniform, we found that vaccination and NPIs were associated with reduced infections, hospitalizations, and deaths across racial/ethnic groups and rurality, whereas no scenarios appeared to be substantially associated with reduced disparities in these outcomes. Although not examined herein, lower vaccine uptake among Black/African American and rural communities<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and the logistical challenges of vaccines requiring ultracold storage<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> and multiple doses have the potential to further exacerbate disparities in COVID-19 mortality.</p>
              <p>Unlike prior deterministic compartmental models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 vaccination,<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> our agent-based simulation model captured heterogeneous mixing between individuals and within households, schools, workplaces, and communities and allowed for joint consideration of various interventions. In this study, we did not intend to forecast COVID-19 burden for a specific population but to support public health officials by comparing the potential outcomes of vaccination and NPI scenarios to, for example, inform the public on the potential effects of vaccine uptake as well as continued adherence to existing mitigation strategies.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> Our agent-based modeling framework and others, such as JUNE,<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> can be adapted to other locations using existing population data and publicly available data on infections and deaths. However, this approach may be less accurate for smaller regions, such as a single county, with relatively low numbers for model validation.</p>
              <p>Our findings are conditional on our modeling assumptions and specification of vaccination and NPI scenarios. Notably, in our simulation, vaccination protected individuals from infection in an all-or-nothing manner (ie, a proportion of susceptible individuals transition to the recovered state), although partial protection could be more realistic.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> For this modeling, vaccination was simplified to confer protection immediately, although evidence shows there to be a delay.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In interpreting the results, the start of vaccination can be considered the onset of protection due to vaccines instead of when the first dose was given. Our modeling also simplified vaccine distribution to a 6-month period for all coverages achieved. Moreover, distribution was uniform across the population and not prioritized by subgroups.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> We expect that phased allocation strategies that target high-risk groups while vaccine supplies are limited would initially lead to a greater reduction in hospitalizations and deaths but would have a lesser effect on total infections compared with our findings. Therefore, to control disease spread, a phased strategy would likely result in a greater need to maintain NPIs throughout vaccination. Finally, our model assumed immunity due to vaccination or recovery from natural infection was permanent. Recent studies found immunity to reinfection lasts at least 6 months,<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> and neutralizing antibodies and other immune responses persist up to 8 months after infection.<sup><xref rid="zoi210319r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210319r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> Given the available evidence and the period modeled, we feel this was a reasonable assumption. However, duration of protection after infection and vaccination remains unknown. If reinfections were more common than assumed, herd immunity would be more challenging to achieve, further emphasizing the need for increased vaccine coverage and maintaining NPIs. Future modeling will need to incorporate emerging evidence on long-term protection due to vaccination and recovery from natural infection.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>In addition to the modeling assumptions discussed above, there are notable limitations to our study. The unique characteristics of North Carolina, including demographic characteristics, prevalence of diabetes, rurality, mobility, and adherence to NPIs, are associated with the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. General insights into the effect of vaccination and NPIs may apply to other states or regions, although exact numerical values will vary. The broad age category (20-64 years) limited age specificity of outcomes among adults. Demographic attributes (eg, age and race/ethnicity) within tracts were assigned independently, and interactions were not fully captured. Although our model projections followed major state-level counts and trends in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, they did not capture all variability in reality, either over time or within subpopulations. Furthermore, although variability in outcomes across replications was calculated, our results do not reflect uncertainty in the model structure and parameter specification. However, sensitivity analysis suggests our main findings are robust to variability in important infection transmission and mitigation parameters.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The results of this decision analytical study suggest that vaccinating the majority of the adult population and continued adherence to NPIs, such as distancing and use of face masks, will have the greatest effect on ending the current COVID-19 pandemic. These findings emphasize the need for resources and coordination to achieve high vaccine coverage and continued adherence to NPIs before safely resuming many prepandemic activities.</p>
