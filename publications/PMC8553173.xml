              <abstract>
                <p>Epidemiological simulations as a method are used to better understand and predict the spreading of infectious diseases, for example of COVID-19. This paper presents an approach that combines a well-established approach from transportation modelling that uses person-centric data-driven human mobility modelling with a mechanistic infection model and a person-centric disease progression model. The model includes the consequences of different room sizes, air exchange rates, disease import, changed activity participation rates over time (coming from mobility data), masks, indoors vs. outdoors leisure activities, and of contact tracing. It is validated against the infection dynamics in Berlin (Germany). The model can be used to understand the contributions of different activity types to the infection dynamics over time. It predicts the effects of contact reductions, school closures/vacations, masks, or the effect of moving leisure activities from outdoors to indoors in fall, and is thus able to quantitatively predict the consequences of interventions. It is shown that these effects are best given as additive changes of the reproduction number R. The model also explains why contact reductions have decreasing marginal returns, i.e. the first 50% of contact reductions have considerably more effect than the second 50%. Our work shows that is is possible to build detailed epidemiological simulations from microscopic mobility models relatively quickly. They can be used to investigate mechanical aspects of the dynamics, such as the transmission from political decisions via human behavior to infections, consequences of different lockdown measures, or consequences of wearing masks in certain situations. The results can be used to inform political decisions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>When COVID-19 took hold in Germany in February 2020, there was an urgent need for a differentiated modelling capability to predict the consequences of interventions. We used our experience with person-centric modelling of traffic [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] to build a first prototype within two weeks [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. An advantage of using this starting point is that the whereabouts of all simulated persons, including their overlapping time spent at facilities or in (public transport) vehicles, are already given by the model, which is derived in part from mobile phone data. Since the input data contains age as an attribute of each synthetic person, it was straightforward to include agent-dependent disease progression into the model from the start. A short description of the different model variants over time is provided in <xref rid="pone.0259037.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Text</xref>.</p>
              <p>The model is regularly used to advise the German federal government (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259037.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). The main contribution of those reports was and is to provide differentiated predictions of the influence of various interventions, such as reductions of activity participation, masks, or vaccinations. For the present paper, we show the contributions of different activity types to the infection dynamics as predicted by the model. We show how most activity types generate over time fairly constant contributions to the reproduction number <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>, independent from the actual <italic toggle="yes">level</italic> of R. In consequence it is structurally more stable to report reductions of <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> caused by interventions as an additive term, rather than a term that is relative to the overall level of <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> as is usually done (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). The model also explains why there are decreasing marginal returns to stay-at-home interventions [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Finally, the model makes a prediction concerning the magnitude of the difference between summer and winter, caused by moving activities indoors during winter.</p>

                <title>Compartmental models</title>
                <p>The general dynamics of virus spreading are captured by compartmental models, most famously the so-called SIR model, with <italic toggle="yes">S</italic> = <italic toggle="yes">susceptible</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I</italic> = <italic toggle="yes">infected/infectious</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> = <italic toggle="yes">recovered</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Every time a <italic toggle="yes">susceptible</italic> and an <italic toggle="yes">infectious</italic> person meet, there is a probability that the susceptible person becomes infected. Some time after the infection, the person typically recovers. Variants include, e.g., an <italic toggle="yes">exposed</italic> (but not yet <italic toggle="yes">infectious</italic>) compartment between <italic toggle="yes">S</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>.</p>
                <p>Instead of running these models with compartments, one can run them on a graph [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259037.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Persons are represented as vertices, connections between persons are denoted as edges. The random interactions that are implied by the compartmental models are then replaced by interactions with graph neighbors.</p>
                <p>In reality, these interactions change from day to day; in particular, possible superspreading events like weddings or other large gatherings cannot be encoded in a static graph. For this, temporal networks have been investigated ([<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], section VIII).</p>
                <p>An advantage of compartmental models is that their runtime is independent from system size; in that way, it is easily possible to run a model for a country or a continent. A disadvantage is that one needs a separate compartment for each attribute combination (e.g. age × activity pattern × disease state), and that mechanical aspects such as the reduction of virus intake by masks, are difficult to include into the model. A special case is [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]: It treats each census block as a subpopulation, computes how virus travels from one census block to another via points-of-interest with visitors from both census blocks, and also has internal virus dynamics in each census block. The differences to our work are discussed in more detail in <xref rid="pone.0259037.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Text</xref>.</p>

                <title>Person-centric epidemiological modelling</title>
                <p>An alternative to compartmental models is to use synthetic persons as the starting point for modelling, and to “consider nodes as entities where multiple individuals or particles can be located and eventually wander by moving along the links connecting the nodes” [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Examples of such models can be found since approximately 2004 [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A model of this type by Imperial College [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] had a large impact on policy in the UK. Other recent developments are [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259037.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] on the global scale, or [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259037.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] on the urban scale. These models typically follow individual synthetic persons. However, most of them, with the possible exception of the Virginia Biotechnology Institute model [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259037.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], have explicit person movements only for commute patterns; all other infections are assumed to be in a local environment.</p>
                <p>Aleta et al. [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] construct an agent-based model, similar to ours. Their data derives from persons specifically recruited to collect their long-term trajectories. They have long trajectories, with high spatial precision, but for only 2% of the population. This is still an impressive sample; however, with our work we aim for models where we have as many synthetic persons in the model as there are persons in reality.</p>
                <p>A special case is by Kucharski et al.

                <title>Daily activity trajectories</title>
                <p>Using daily activity chains as the basis for transport modelling is an established approach in the transport modelling community. An activity chain is a sequence of activities of a person, where activities have types such as home, work, shop, etc., starting and ending times, and locations. There are several ways to generate such activity chains, for example by using activity-based demand generation models (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259037.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]), by taking them from travel diaries (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259037.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]), by using mobile phone data (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]), or by data fusion from open access data sources (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]).</p>
                <p>In the present situation, we needed a technology that was readily available, allowed uniform rollout at least in Germany, and that would allow updates along with changes in mobility behavior during the unfolding of the COVID epidemics. For that reason, we used an established process that generates activity chains mostly from mobile phone data [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The process is described in more detail in <xref rid="pone.0259037.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>. The outcome of the process are activity chains, encoded as events (cf. <xref rid="pone.0259037.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), for as many synthetic persons as Germany has inhabitants. Since the activity chains stem from transport modelling, they also contain knowledge about trips between activities, importantly trips by public transport, and in consequence also contain, for each synthetic person, events when they enter or leave certain public transit vehicles.</p>

                <title>Person-centric epidemiological models derived from transport simulations</title>
                <p>From the section on person-centric epidemiological modelling above, one takes away that having person trajectories, and in particular where persons meet, would be useful for an epidemiological simulation. In consequence, the synthetic person trajectories from transport modelling explained above seem like a good starting point, since they are already available. Smieszek et al. [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259037.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and Hackl and Dubernet [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] construct epidemiological models on top of such pre-existing synthetic person trajectories; these are the main starting point for us. Najmi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] start from a person-centric transportation planning model for Sydney, and add a disease transmission model that computes possible infections based on co-locations during the simulated day. The approach is similar to ours, but does not use mobile phone data to track the actual mobility behavior. They also do not use an infection model that depends on the spatial situation of the activity type.</p>
                <p>The model described in the present paper has always been open source, and earlier version have been described in preprints [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259037.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259037.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

                <p>There are many data sets that track or analyze mobility changes “during Corona” [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This is, however, not our primary focus; rather, we are interested in how the infection dynamics can be better understood and possibly predicted with the help of mobility and other data. A possible approach to achieve this is data mining [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259037.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

[<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] look at how long distance travel influences the disease import; they find that a high inflow from areas with high incidences is positively correlated with high infection numbers. They do not, however, look at disease spread within the urban fabric, driven by daily movement patterns.</p>
                <p>Fairly close to our work are Chang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], already mentioned earlier. They first construct, based on mobile phone data, a mobility network between census block groups and points of interest based on mobile phone data, and then use that model to investigate reopening strategies. They have a very detailed resolution of the facilities (they differentiate, e.g., between full-service restaurants, limited-service restaurants, and cafes/snack bars), but on the other hand they do not simulate individual synthetic persons.

                  <p>For SARS-CoV-2, it is plausible to assume that a large share of the virus material is shed as aerosol [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].

Evidently, that concentration is inversely proportional to room size: if the room is twice as large, the resulting concentration is half as large.</p>
                  <p>Next, air exchange plays a role [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. One could, for example, assume that the windows are opened once per hour, and all of the air is replaced with outside air. This would correspond to an air exchange rate of 1/h. If one assumes a constant rate of virus emission, there would be a linear increase of concentration up to the opening of the window, after which the virus concentration in the air would quickly go towards zero. The <italic toggle="yes">average</italic> virus concentration over this process would be half as much as the maximum concentration just before window opening.

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">ci</italic>′ parameterizes the “closeness” of the interaction. This is, cf. <xref rid="pone.0259037.e012" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq (7)</xref>, divided by <italic toggle="yes">roomCapacity</italic>, which denotes the number of persons that fit into the room given typical usage. If we share a room with one infectious other person, then our probability to become infected is, all other things being equal, half as large if the room is twice as large. However, if the room is twice as large, then there will presumably also be twice as many persons in it, doubling our own risk, and thus in the average cancelling out the effect of the larger room size. This second effect is computed directly by our contact model (Sec. From reductions of mobility behavior to reductions of infections above), and thus does not have to be included into the conditional infection probability. This has the additional advantage that if a person is in large container outside its peak usage, the model will calculate a much reduced infection probability. Examples for this are public transport vehicles, premises for large events, or restaurants.</p>
                  <p>A side effect of this model is that the above division by <italic toggle="yes">N<sup>spacesPerFacility</sup></italic> has no effect in first order. If <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> persons at the facility are all in one room, and one contagious person is added, the expected number of newly infected persons is <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>⋅<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>, where <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> is the individual probability to become infected according to <xref rid="pone.0259037.e001" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq (1)</xref> with <xref rid="pone.0259037.e012" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq (7)</xref>. If the <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> persons are divided between <italic toggle="yes">N<sup>spacesPerFacility</sup></italic>, and one contagious person is added into one room, the expected number of newly infected persons is (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">N<sup>spacesPerFacility</sup></italic>) · <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>′, where <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>′ in first order is <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> · <italic toggle="yes">N<sup>spacesPerFacility</sup></italic>, because <italic toggle="yes">roomCapacity</italic> in <xref rid="pone.0259037.e012" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq (7)</xref> is divided by <italic toggle="yes">N<sup>spacesPerFacility</sup></italic>. In consequence, in first order the expected number of newly infected persons in the divided facility is the same, <italic toggle="yes">np</italic>, as in the undivided facility.—Second-order corrections come from the fact that <xref rid="pone.0259037.e001" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq (1)</xref> eventually saturates when infection probabilities become large—then the smaller room sizes reduce the number of infections.</p>

                <title>Calibration</title>
                <p>The calibration procedure undertaken for the present paper is described in the following sections. Calibration is performed by visual comparison, with first priority against the time series of the number of hospital patients in Berlin, and with second priority against the COVID case numbers in Berlin. The calibration procedure, as described in the following, is as much about which elements to include at all as about finding the right parameters. “Second priority” here means that if calibration against hospital numbers is undecided between two alternatives, then the case numbers are used in addition. The case numbers are only used with second priority since the screening procedure has been changed multiple times, which means that the resulting time series is not homogeneous and thus not useful for model calibration. In particular, under-reporting in the initial phases was much larger than later. More information about the COVID case numbers in Berlin can be found in Sec 2 of <xref rid="pone.0259037.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>. A formal calibration of Θ can be found in Sec. Out of sample prediction. The calibration includes the following elements:

                <p>We take the disease import from abroad from data published by RKI ([<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], always on Tuesdays). Currently, for Germany this data is only available on a nationwide aggregated level. For this reason we scale it down to our Berlin model by using the population size. The data is dated on the reporting date and not on the actual date of becoming sick. Since the infection seeds are initiated into our model with the status <italic toggle="yes">exposed</italic> (cf. <xref rid="pone.0259037.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) and it can be assumed that the reporting date is significantly after the exposure date, we date the data from RKI back by one week. The data provided by RKI is available as weekly values so we assign these values to the respective Monday and then interpolate between them. Since we assume underreporting in the RKI numbers, we multiply them by 4; this is discussed in Sec. Under-reporting, and its variation over time. The initially infected persons are drawn randomly from the population. The resulting disease import is shown in <xref rid="pone.0259037.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>.

                <p>In terms of calibration, the initial growth is, within limits, insensitive against changes of Θ, since it is dominated by the disease import.

                <title>Reductions of activity participation</title>
                <p>During the unfolding of the epidemics, people decided or were ordered to no longer participate in certain activities. We model this by removing an activity from a person’s schedule, plus the travel to and from the activity. For example, if a person in their original plan goes from home to activity A and then back home, then the activity plus both trips are removed from the schedule. If a person in their original plan goes from home via activity A to activity B and then back home, and activity A is deleted, then the following elements are removed: (a) the trip from home to activity A; (b) activity A; (c) the trip from activity A to activity B. In the current model, the schedule is not repaired: neither is the home activity nor are other activities prolonged, and also the trip chain is not mended. See <xref rid="pone.0259037.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Text</xref> for possible improvements here. The consequence of those activity and trip removals is that the person no longer interacts with people at that activity location, and in consequence neither can infect other persons nor can become infected during that activity, or while in public transport vehicles to and from that activity. Overall, this reduces contact options, and thus reduces epidemic spread.</p>
                <p>A very important consequence of our modelling approach is that we can take that reduction in activity participation from data. That data comes from the same source as our original activity patterns. However, the activity <italic toggle="yes">type</italic> detection algorithm is not very good for these unusual activity patterns during the pandemics, as one can see in <xref rid="pone.0259037.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> when knowing that all educational institutions were closed in Berlin after Mar/15. What is reliable, though, is the differentiation between at-home and out-of-home time, as displayed in <xref rid="pone.0259037.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>. One clearly notices that out-of-home activities are somewhat reduced after Mar/8, and dramatically reduced soon after. After some experimentation, it was decided to take weekly averages of the activity non-participation, and use that uniformly across all activity types in our model, except for educational activities, which were taken as ordered by the government.</p>

                <p>To remove an activity with a certain probability, a random draw is made every time a synthetic person has that activity type in its plan. This means that the model assumes that, say for a 50% work reduction, there will be a different 50% subset of persons at work every day. This intervention, in consequence, does not sever infection networks, but just slows down the dynamics.</p>
                <p>One takes from <xref rid="pone.0259037.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref> that the mobility reductions, as given by the mobility data, is by itself not sufficient to explain the decreasing case numbers during spring. Evidently, one could now reduce Θ, and this is what we have done in our early simulations. This, however, artificially reduces the infection dynamics, and means that the simulation will miss the second wave in fall.</p>

                <title>Outdoors vs. indoors season</title>
                <p>The probability of getting infected during an encounter depends on whether the encounter takes place indoors or outdoors. Outdoors, the probability of infection is significantly reduced compared to indoors. This is due to the fact that outdoors the air is constantly in motion and therefore aerosols cannot accumulate. We assume that an encounter outdoors decreases the infection probability by one magnitude [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259037.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In countries like Germany, seasonality has a great influence on how much time people spend outdoors. In summer, people spend more time outdoors, while in winter they tend to spend more time indoors.</p>
                <p>We include into our model that up to 100% of leisure activities are undertaken outdoors during summer, while that share reduces to 0% during winter. When an activity occurs outdoors, the otherwise identical computation of the infection probability is divided by 10. The model takes the actual temperatures as input; if the daily maximum temperature is larger than <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>* + 5<italic toggle="yes">C</italic>, then all leisure activities that can happen outdoors are outdoors; if the daily maximum temperature is smaller than <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>* − 5<italic toggle="yes">C</italic>, then all leisure activities happen indoors; in between, probabilities are linearly interpolated. We use <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>* = 17.5<italic toggle="yes">C</italic> in spring, linearly increasing to <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>* = 25<italic toggle="yes">C</italic> in fall; using a lower <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>* in spring is behaviorally plausible in Germany, and yields a far more plausible infection dynamics than keeping them the same.</p>
                <p>The justification for this is as follows. A survey on physical activities [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] shows that, in summer, people in Germany perform about 80% of their physical activities outdoors, while this proportion shrinks to 10% in winter. We have assumed that other leisure activities (e.g. restaurants, visit friends) behave similarly. We also extend our range to 0 and 100% since the fluctuations of the temperature already lead to average values that are more than 0 and less than 100% (cf. <xref rid="pone.0259037.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>).</p>

                <p>Initially, all activity types play a role. After the closure of the universities, schools, and day care in March, both their absolute numbers and their shares go to zero. At the same time, the infections share of work (gray) in April and May reflects that persons were drifting back to normal activity patterns (cf. <xref rid="pone.0259037.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Leisure (green) would have shown the same trend, but that was counter-acted by the increasing shift of activities to outdoors. In the bottom plot, the purple line shows how the share of infections in public transit decreases significantly near the end of April because of increased wearing of masks. (Recall that we use observed mask compliance.) In July we see how day care (blue) picks up, because it was re-opened. Schools re-open in the second week of August, and pick up accordingly (brown). Also, two weeks of school vacation in October are clearly reflected in the brown curve. From September on we then see a strong increase of the infections share of leisure activities—corresponding to moving leisure activities from outdoors to indoors as explained earlier.</p>

where <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) refers to all persons who turned contagious on day <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>.

This is also the reason why we use the date when turning contagious and not the date when they got infected, since that would increase that temporal gap even more. <xref rid="pone.0259037.g014" ref-type="fig">Fig 14</xref> shows the resulting values, with <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) much larger than one in the initial phase, then lower than one until the end of summer, and then increasing to above one in fall.

                <title>Reproduction number per activity type</title>
                <p>More insightful than the number or share of infections, as presented in Sec. Infections per activity type above, is the average <italic toggle="yes">reproduction number</italic> in each activity type. The method counts for each infected person the number of persons they infect at each activity context. As in Sec. Reproduction number above, the numbers are dated back to the date when the person became contagious, and then averaged over all those persons.</p>
                <p>For example, an activity-specific R-value for school of <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">school</italic></sub>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) = 0.1 means that each person that becomes contagious on day <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>, in the average, infects 0.1 other persons at school. Evidently, if only 10% of persons turning contagious on day <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> have school anywhere in their activity pattern, then each such person would have to infect one other person in the school context in order to reach the population-average value of 0.1.</p>
                <p>Adding up these activity-specific reproduction numbers leads to the overall reproduction number. This explains why, in first order, the overall reproduction number can be additively decomposed into the contributions of the different activity types.</p>
                <p>One sees, in <xref rid="pone.0259037.g015" ref-type="fig">Fig 15</xref>, that the reproduction number at home remains roughly constant—a person who gets infected in any way reinfects on average about 0.35 persons at home. Work is related to the mobility data—if less time is spent out-of-home, then in the model less time is spent at work, leading to fewer infections. Schools were closed in the middle of March, and not reopened until the second week of August. Also, there is a school vacation during the second and third week of October. Day care according to the model has little effect. Day care was already re-opened partially in June, and fully in July. The reproduction number at leisure is strongly driven by the weather: If it is warm, the model assumes that most of the leisure activities take place outdoors, where they contribute little to the infection dynamics. In consequence, this effect plays an important role in spring, where the warmer temperature played as much a role as the reduction of the out-of-home activites. One also clearly sees the strong growth of the leisure reproduction number in fall, which according to these simulations is driving the second wave in Berlin. Public transport is strongly visible in March, until the obligation to wear masks was introduced. All other infection contexts, e.g. errands or business activities, are combined in the category “other”.</p>

                <p>It has been pointed out by other studies that the reproduction numbers at home play an important role and reduce the remaining “space” one has available for infections outside home [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The reproduction number at home can be reduced by moving persons showing symptoms, and more radically persons identified as contacts by contact tracing, into separate facilities, sometimes called quarantine hotels.</p>
                <p>One also notices that all infection contexts can be strongly reduced by wearing masks—this (evidently) even holds for leisure. Clearly, they would need to be worn <italic toggle="yes">during</italic> the activities, and not just during access and egress. Wearing masks during class at school has hesitantly been adopted in Berlin during November; wearing masks during work, in particular in office buildings, has never been pursued seriously in Germany and is still not obligatory if occupants have at least 10 <italic toggle="yes">m</italic><sup>2</sup> available per person—which is the value with which our simulations run and which generate the numbers of <xref rid="pone.0259037.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>
                <p>Evidently, a tricky context is leisure. According to our simulations, leisure alone, in conjunction with home, would be sufficient to keep <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> above one during winter, and thus needs to be suppressed accordingly. Keeping other activity contexts open without masks implies that leisure needs to be suppressed even further if <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> &lt; 1 is to be achieved.</p>
                <p>Conversely, during summer achieving an <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> &lt; 1 is relatively easy. This explains why there were few problems during summer in Germany (and most other European countries). Evidently, all of this refers to the original variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was less transmissible than later variants.</p>

                <title>Decreasing marginal effect of interventions</title>
                <p>In <xref rid="pone.0259037.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, for all activity types, a reduction of the participation by 50% reduces the contribution to R by far more than 50%: at work from 0.17 to 0.04, at school from 0.07 to 0.02, etc. In consequence, the next 50% reduction of participation, i.e. closing the activity type completely, will yield a much smaller reduction of infections. This is consistent with the empirical observation that the marginal effect of stay-at-home interventions decreases [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
                <p>From our model, this can be explained as follows (see <xref rid="pone.0259037.g016" ref-type="fig">Fig 16</xref>): Assume, for example, that each morning each school child throws a coin and goes to school only when it shows heads; this means that school participation is reduced to 50%. In consequence, if there is an infectious person at school, only half as many other persons have a chance to get infected. (This assumes that they use the same classrooms as before, at half the density.) However, the probability that an undetected infectious person goes to school is also reduced to 50%. Multiplying these two probabilities means that only 50% ⋅ 50% = 25% of the infections happen in this case. That is, the first 50% of the reduction has already 75% of the possible effect.</p>

In consequence, when dividing classes and alternating their attendance, the number of infections is reduced from 9<italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>0</sub> to 2<italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>0</sub>. For large group sizes, the reduction converges to 1/4. The same holds when each individual attendance is decided randomly with probability 1/2 at the beginning of each day.</p>

In this situation, the expected number of infections is proportional to <italic toggle="yes">kN</italic>.

                <p>The expected number of infections in consequence reduces to <italic toggle="yes">αkαN</italic>, i.e. <italic toggle="yes">α</italic><sup>2</sup> as many as before.</p>
                <p>Evidently, this means that 1 − 0.75<sup>2</sup> ≈ 44% of the effect is obtained with the first 25% of the intervention, another 1 − 0.5<sup>2</sup> − 44% = 31% of the effect are obtained with the next 25% of the intervention, and the remaining 25% of the effect need the remaining 50% of the stay-at-home intervention for this particular activity.</p>
                <p>In terms of the management of COVID-19, this implies that it is far better to include each activity type/sector of the economy to some extent, rather than shutting down some sectors completely while leaving some other sectors completely open.</p>

                <title>Out of sample prediction</title>
                <p>We show the predictive performance of our model by calibrating the simulation on a fixed training set and comparing simulation results into the future against unused data. In this calibration Θ is calibrated such that the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) between hospital cases in the simulation compared to historic data is minimized. For this, the simulation is run with eight different Monte Carlo seeds and then the results are averaged. Because one simulation run is quite computationally expensive, a <italic toggle="yes">Tree-structured Parzen Estimator</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], implemented by the Optuna package [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] in Python, is used to sample the parameter space more efficiently.</p>
                <p>RMSLE has the advantage that it is less sensitive to the scale of the data than RMSE. That is, relative errors in valleys have as much weight as relative errors on the ridges. This also corresponds to the visual impression of the logarithmic plots often used in epidemics and used throughout the paper. Results using RMSE instead of RMSLE and some more discussion can be found in <xref rid="pone.0259037.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Text</xref>.</p>
                <p>We run this calibration up to various dates. From there on, we perform two types of prediction: (a) <xref rid="pone.0259037.g017" ref-type="fig">Fig 17</xref> left: With activity participation levels frozen at the level of the last calibration day (see the second column of <xref rid="pone.0259037.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; only during school vacations are school and work activities reduced for prediction dates); (b) <xref rid="pone.0259037.g017" ref-type="fig">Fig 17</xref> right: With activity levels as given from the data also for prediction dates. For both cases, the import is frozen at 4 imported cases per day, while the daily maximum temperature is forecast based on the average over the last 10 years.</p>

                <p>One finds that the correct activity level (<xref rid="pone.0259037.g017" ref-type="fig">Fig 17</xref> right) is crucial especially for longer-term predictions: Even with calibration only to the end of April, the model predicts the autumn wave very well, while when the activity numbers are frozen (<xref rid="pone.0259037.g017" ref-type="fig">Fig 17</xref> left), the forecasts have a drift depending on whether the activity level is too low or too high on the day when it is frozen. Particularly striking is the blue curve (“2020–05-01”): on the left, the activity participation level is frozen at 71% (cf. <xref rid="pone.0259037.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), while on the right it varies mostly between 80% and 100% as given by the data plotted in <xref rid="pone.0259037.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>. This is consistent with the theoretical argument (Sec. Decreasing marginal effect of interventions) that an activity participation of 71% reduces infections to 71% ⋅ 71% ≈ 50% while an activity participation of 90% reduces infections only to 91% ⋅ 90% ≈ 80%. That difference is sufficient to generate the difference between the two curves.</p>

                <p>In an older version of the model [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we had all contact intensities set to one. The contributions of each activity type to the infection dynamics then in first order corresponded to the average weekly time consumption in the respective activity. For example, averaged over the week including the weekend, school consumes about 5 hours per day for persons going to school. However, since in Berlin only about 10% of the population are school children, <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/BasisZeitreiheGrafik/Bas-Schulen.asp?Ptyp=300&amp;Sageb=21001&amp;creg=BBB&amp;anzwer=5" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/BasisZeitreiheGrafik/Bas-Schulen.asp?Ptyp=300&amp;Sageb=21001&amp;creg=BBB&amp;anzwer=5</ext-link> the average time consumption for the school activity is only 0.43 hours per day when taken across the whole population (cf. <xref rid="pone.0259037.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In contrast, there are more persons going to work than to school, thus increasing the weight of work in the infection dynamics (1.83 hours per day). A similar weight comes from the leisure activities, which are not necessarily more hours per week for each individual person, but where <italic toggle="yes">all</italic> persons contribute to this type of time consumption, resulting in an average of 1.67 hours per day. In consequence, restricting leisure activities had a large effect in that model.</p>

                <p>In the present model, the time consumptions are now multiplied by the normalized contact intensities in those activity types, cf. <xref rid="pone.0259037.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. In consequence, leisure, which already had a large share before, is now multiplied with a large contact intensity, and in consequence now gets even more weight. Work, despite occupying similar amounts of time, is weighted down because of the multiplication by a much smaller contact intensity. On the other end of the scale, public transport has, at full occupancy, a large contact intensity, but the times spent in public transport are considerably smaller than, say, at work. Also, persons in public transport are required to wear masks, while at work they are not.</p>
                <p>A complicated case are schools and day care: They occupy large amounts of time, <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> have a large contact intensity, both somewhat similar to leisure. In consequence, the re-opening of day care in July and of the schools in August should have had strong consequences in the infection numbers but did not. We took that observation as confirmation that their larger-than-average contact intensity is compensated for by a smaller-than-average infectivity and susceptibility (cf. Sec. Children).</p>
                <p>For other diseases, for example influenza, all of the above may need to be adapted. For example, children may have a larger infectivity/susceptibility than adults, which then multiplied with their large contact intensity would lead to a large contribution to the infection dynamics. In consequence, these sub-models need to be understood and re-calibrated for each individual communicable disease.</p>

                <p>The simulation uses one uniform Θ (cf. <xref rid="pone.0259037.e001" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq 1</xref>) that remains the same over the whole simulation period. In consequence, the dynamics is driven by other inputs. These are, after the initial disease import (<xref rid="pone.0259037.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>), primarily the activity participation (<xref rid="pone.0259037.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>) and the temperature-dependent outdoors fraction (<xref rid="pone.0259037.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>).</p>

We have checked for other mechanisms driving the fall wave but obvious possibilities, such as the return-to-school or the summer disease import, both make the hospital numbers in fall start going up in the middle of August rather than at the beginning of September. <xref rid="pone.0259037.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Text</xref> also shows that a less asymmetric indoors/outdoors model performs worse. Evidently, it is possible that in reality the virus seasonality is also caused by other aspects [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], and our model absorbs them into the indoors/outdoors model. Still, if one accepts the aerosol infection as major pathway, then the assumption that indoors vs. outdoors activities play a strong role is plausible.</p>
                <p>The effect of the contact intensities was already discussed in Sec. Intuition for these results. From that discussion, it follows that the number of infections in an activity context depends, in first order, linearly on the contact intensity of that activity type. In consequence, if a contact intensity in <xref rid="pone.0259037.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> or <xref rid="pone.0259037.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> is, say, a factor of 2 too large, then the resulting infections (<xref rid="pone.0259037.g013" ref-type="fig">Fig 13</xref> top), share of infections (<xref rid="pone.0259037.g013" ref-type="fig">Fig 13</xref> bottom), and R-value per activity type (<xref rid="pone.0259037.g015" ref-type="fig">Fig 15</xref>) in first order get divided by two. In second order, the calibration parameter Θ would have to get increased to bring infections back to the previous level.</p>
                <p><xref rid="pone.0259037.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Text</xref> also shows that the model fit degrades considerably when the mask model is removed.</p>

One immediately finds two issues: (A) The categories are not well aligned. For example, “small gathering cancellation” refers to gatherings with 50 persons or less, while other studies cancel gatherings <italic toggle="yes">larger</italic> than a certain number. Again other studies just consider a “gathering ban”, but at the same time have “event ban” and “venue closure” as separate items. (B) Even where the categories are well aligned, the resulting numbers vary significantly: for example, “closing schools and universities” goes from 16% to 38%.</p>

                <p>In part, this is a consequence of the fact that the interventions are not standardized: For example, the number of exemptions in what is called a lockdown varied quite a lot between countries.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the transmission mechanisms from policy decision to execution vary, so even if the concept may be the same, the effect may be quite different between countries. For example, our reductions to <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> caused by school closures come out at the lower end of the range, and lower than those of Brauner et al. [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We attribute this to the following two elements: First, the model by Brauner et al. has no initial disease import which is then brought to a halt. In consequence, their approach has to assign all changes in the infection dynamics to the school closures. The school closures in Berlin, with Mar/12 (fri) or Mar/15 (mon) as the last day of school, too late to explain that the infection numbers stopped in the middle of March. Also, Dehning et al. [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] have an additional change point on Mar/7, corroborating that something has changed before the school closures. Second, other than both Brauner et al. and Dehning et al., we have the mobility data of <xref rid="pone.0259037.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> at our disposal. It is clear that there was considerably more societal adaptation around the weekend of Mar/13–14 than just keeping children at home. Brauner et al. themselves write that “the closure of schools … may have caused … behaviour changes. We do not distinguish this indirect signalling effect from the direct effect”. Additionally, in Germany, children staying at home will force their parents to stay at home, thus forcing them into home office. In consequence, some of this may not be signalling, but causal secondary effects. In consequence, our model is more differentiated: What Brauner et al. attribute to the school closures alone is in our model attributed to a combination of school closures, behavioral changes, and the reduction of various other out-of-home activities. Thus, all of the values may be correct: The pure effect of school closures in western countries (with relatively few young people) may not be larger than 7%, but the measurable consequence for <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> when governments closed schools as their first intervention presumably indeed was much larger.</p>
                <p>Clearly, data-driven mechanical models such as ours help clarifying the categories since we can exactly specify what we mean by closing some activity type or wearing a mask at certain activity types. Also, we can differentiate between the transmission from political decision to behavioral execution vs. the consequences of the behavioral execution to the infection dynamics. Finally, we can mechanically include organizational approaches such as contact tracing.</p>

                <title>Masks</title>
                <p>We have checked our relatively large reductions of <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> for masks in <xref rid="pone.0259037.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> multiple times. They are a consequence of the assumption that N95 masks reduce intake to 2.5%, taken from [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The review article [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] comes up with about 5%, a factor of two larger, but still displaying a very large reduction. The same paper [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] also shows that “masks” without a specification of the type has much less of an effect. Finally, there may be the issue that lay people may not be able to use N95 masks at full efficiency. In consequence, our results have to be interpreted once more “mechanically”: They are plausible under the assumption that the fraction of people specified in the model is indeed able to use N95 masks effectively.</p>

                <title>Under-reporting, and its variation over time</title>
                <p>A known issue with epidemiological data and thus the simulations that build on it is the issue of under-reporting, i.e. that there are more infections in reality than are in the data. Looking at <xref rid="pone.0259037.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12</xref>, it is clear that our current model assumes only little under-reporting during August to October. This originally led to hospital numbers that were too large; since we cannot reduce the number of infections below the case numbers, this justifies why we reduce simulated hospital numbers by a factor of 2 compared to [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (cf. <xref rid="pone.0259037.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). This, in turn, implies that, if we want to get the spring hospital numbers right, our simulated infection numbers in spring need to be about a factor of 8 larger than the reported case numbers.</p>
                <p>Also note that our simulation includes non-symptomatic cases, which come on top of the symptomatic cases that we show in our figures such as <xref rid="pone.0259037.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12</xref>; that is, the actual under-reporting is even larger. Still, it is entirely possible that Germany’s testing strategy is missing even more cases, in which case the simulation would need to aim for even larger numbers of infected persons. As long as the number of seropositive persons in Germany remains in the single-digit percentage ranges [<xref rid="pone.0259037.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], the predictions made by the simulation are not strongly affected by this issue. Once the infections start to saturate, i.e. approach herd immunity, this will become important. Hopefully, by then systematic antibody screenings will be available, and we will be able to calibrate the model against the case numbers that must have been infected in the past. Given that we have the hospital numbers for control, we expect this to be straightforward.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>We combine a person-centric human mobility model with a mechanical model of infection and a person-centric disease progression model into an epidemiological simulation model. Different from other models, we take the movements of the persons, including the intervening activities where they can interact with other people, directly from data, which has already been available for transport planning before the pandemics. For privacy reasons, we rely on a process that takes the original mobile phone data, extracts statistical properties, and then synthesizes movement trajectories from the statistical properties; one could use the original mobile phone trajectories directly if they were available. The model is used to replay the epidemics in Berlin. It is shown that the second wave in Berlin can be modelled well with an explicit temperature dependency of the outdoors fraction for leisure activities. The model is then used to evaluate different intervention strategies, such as closing educational facilities, reducing other out-of-home activities, wearing masks, or contact tracing, and to determine differentiated changes of the reproduction number <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> per intervention.</p>

Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jun 26 2021 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>

              <p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
              <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The paper “Predicting the effects of COVID-19 related interventions in urban settings by combining activity-based modeling, agent-based simulation, and mobile phone data” proposes a person-centric model that incorporates mobility patterns derived by cell phone usage and numerous other factors with a person-specific variant of a S(E)IR model to better understand how specific political interventions affect the rate of reinfections. Overall, the model offers an immaculate depth of a possible system that explains the progression of the pandemic in Berlin. Still, there are multiple major and minor questions that I would like to be answered before advising the manuscript for publication.</p>
              <p>Major Remarks:</p>
              <p>-While I generally admire the depth of the proposed model, I am not completely sure from what empirical evidence we really draw the conclusion. In particular, I am not sure to what extent the model choices or the mobility patterns drive the results. In my opinion, there are still multiple unknowns regarding the transmission of COVID-19, e.g., where do they happen, what effective difference is between an N95, medical mask, or cloth. Still, all this missing knowledge is completed with sometimes more or less empirical values in the presented model. I definitely see the sense of having this type of model, but the caveats should be stated clearly in the paper.</p>
              <p>-The article would greatly benefit from a discussion of the sensitivity and stability of the system. If I understand the manuscript correctly, only one parameter is chosen in the Calibration, but how sensitive and stable is the system to different values of this coefficient? And what kind of sensitivity checks of all other parameters were carried out? By this I mean some assessment of how robust the conclusions drawn are.</p>
              <p>An adequate discussion and communication of the uncertainties in the model are missing. On multiple occasions, this would benefit the manuscript.</p>
              <p>- Fig. 4: What do the shaded areas indicate?</p>
              <p>- Fig. 6 TOP: The numbers are really low, hence some uncertainty over multiple iterations of the pandemic would be great. Here, one could, e.g., sample different mobility patterns in the Senozon method? Overall, multiple runs of the simulations should enable some type of uncertainty quantification.</p>
              <p>-The calibration of the only non-fixed parameter also has associated uncertainty. Here some additional information on how the calibration is performed is needed. Can one understand it as some type of method of moments, where the coefficient is picked so that the observed time series of cases and hospitalizations is conserved as closely as possible in the simulation model? If so it is unclear one differentiates between primary and secondary priority. Some mathematical formulas in the Annex or Supplementary Material would be helping.</p>
              <p>In the article prediction using the model is named as a possible application. Therefore, some out-of-sample results using historical data are needed.</p>
              <p>-What are the effects of the multiplicative form in equation (1)? Doesn't this form assume that all components are inherently on the same scale? Even though the approximation in (2) is only used for illustrative reasons when does the approximation exactly hold?</p>
              <p>Minor Remarks:</p>
              <p>-Generally, the presentation of the introduction could be more concise. At the moment, the narrative is based on how prior versions of the model were improved over time with multiple features but it does not become apparent why we even need a person-centric simulation model next to the standard S(E)IR models readily available. Also, I would check if all the citations to prior versions of the model are really needed.</p>
              <p>It is also not clearly evident what the section on related work really wants to achieve. A clear motivation of agent-based models would be more than enough but the different types of mobility data should rather be discussed in the Annex.</p>
              <p>-Senozon method: Some illustrative examples with a Figure akin to Fig. 1 would be a good addition to the explanation. Is for each person one mobility pattern sample for each day? If so how is prediction performed, where no observations of mobility patterns are available? Also, the section would be more meaning full if some toy examples of an origin-destination matrix and the raw data could be provided. What percentage of people is included in the raw data? Some caveats on the uncertainty associated with the plausible classifications of activities would be fitting. Finally, to be it is not clear how people assumed to be meeting one another given two specific meeting patterns.</p>
              <p>-While the title of the manuscript suggests that the focus lies on urban areas, in the text, we find repeated comments that complete Germany is modeled as well. Why are only the results for Berlin reported? Does the sample only include urban areas or what data sources are missing for rural areas?</p>
              <p>-Does the simulation assume that each home, school etc has the same constant values named in Table 1? Is this reasonable? Even in Berlin, there is some type of income gap, that probably leads to more space per person in wealthy neighborhoods. How could this affect the findings of the article? A random distribution could be used as an alternative maybe even based on the ZIP code?</p>
              <p>-Are the lines in Fig. 4 in- or out-of-sample predictions of the model? And is the blu line the number of people with symptom onset? If so why is it so far of especially in the first few months? In addition, the temporal path of the R-value (Fig. 7) compared to the officially reported value by the RKI would be great to see and assess the proposed model.</p>
              <p>-Did I understand the reasoning behind the additive strucure of interventions correctly in that it is based on the definition as a sum over individual reinfections? If so this should be stated more clearly in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>-Table 3 is not clear to me. The authors of each study should be directly named together with some classification of the used method. Further, the proposed model should be one column in the table. Also, the star at 0 is not clear to me, how can 0 be significantly different from 0?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript “predicting the effects of covid-19 related interventions in urban settings by combining activity-based modeling, agent-based simulation, and mobile phone data” presents a novel approach to simulate the spread of epidemics in urban environments. As opposed to compartmental models, the model presented in the manuscript presents a personalized spatially explicit framework to track the contact between individuals, the probability of infection in each contact, and the progression of the disease in those individuals who were infected. The model manages to predict the trend of the disease spread in the Berlin metropolitan area. As such, I enjoyed reading the manuscript, as it presents a breakthrough in modeling epidemics, by allowing the insertion of explicit and detailed policy measures.</p>
              <p>However, the manuscript contains pitfalls and is often unclear. The authors must take this into account in order for the manuscript to make a valid and clear scientific claim regarding the spread of epidemics in urban environments.</p>
              <p>Model fit:</p>
              <p>The calibration process of the model manages to fit the model with the general trend of the number of cases and hospitalized patients in berlin. However, the manuscript doesn’t suggest any metric that evaluates the model fit. Even if this kind of metric is not the purpose of the authors’ model evaluation, figure 4 presents the data in a logarithmic scale, in order to show the fit of general trend. However, this type of presentation is a bit deceiving without explicitly informing the reader that the purpose of the figure is to compare the trend and not absolute numbers.</p>
              <p>Simulating agents activity:</p>
              <p>It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic changed the travel habits of nearly the entire population, in both short-term and long-term habits. It seems that the simulation conducted takes into account only the short-term travel habits, as it does not simulate replanting of agents' plans of mode choice and destination choice, such as changing the activities to telecommuting and teleducation. Choosing a different mode of transport is very likely given lower capacity or frequency in PT systems, and it is possible to rerun the simulation every n days in order to observe what happens to the modal split. It is true that simulating destination choice is very complex and might not be possible using this framework, however the authors should mention this limitation. In addition, it is not clear from the paper what happens when a person's activity is removed - how does the rest of its plan change?</p>
              <p>Section - Infection model:</p>
              <p>1. page 8: Equation 1 is not clear enough. M is the sum of which other persons? Those in contact? The explanation is for 2 individuals or for multiple individuals?</p>
              <p>2. CI is different for each type of activity, due to the fact that people exhale and inhale more air in different activities (talking, eating, working out etc.). Was this taken into account? Though it affects the wedding rate(sh) more than the actual contact intensity, it is reasonable to materialize it through CI.</p>
              <p>Page 9:</p>
              <p>The explanation for room capacity was hard to grasp. If I understand correctly, nspaces reflects the fact that there is a smaller chance for two people to meet, however if they do, the chance of infection is higher.</p>
              <p>Page 10:</p>
              <p>1. Table 1 is unclear. What term does each column come to represent? The air exchange low and high calculation is not detailed in the main body of the text, and is unclear.</p>
              <p>2. The calculation of CI needs to be refined in an orderly fashion. I tried to manually calculate the values in table 1 and failed.</p>
              <p>3. What is the transition probability from being infectious to showing symptoms? It does not appear in the text.</p>
              <p>Sub section - Indoors/outdoors and second wave:</p>
              <p>Page 13:</p>
              <p>Did leisure activities in Berlin in fact take place outdoors, or that they were also restricted? What fraction of the activities do leisure activities take up?</p>
              <p>“Too early” “not steep enough” please refer to the specific location in the graph, by annotating the graph or by explicitly mentioning the coordinates on the graph.</p>
              <p>Sub section - Infections per activity type:</p>
              <p>Page 13:</p>
              <p>The share of each activity frequency in both count and total duration across all agents is important in order to fully understand figure 6.</p>
              <p>Sub section - Reductions of R per intervention:</p>
              <p>Page 16:</p>
              <p>Table 2 - is R calculated over the entire period? A certain date? If so please specify when.</p>
              <p>When reporting reference [3], you used percent reduction, however here you use additive reduction while explaining why it is better - you should point out the weakness in percent reduction when first mentioning it(page 2).</p>
              <p>Sub section - Intuition for these results:</p>
              <p>Page 17:</p>
              <p>The intuition for decreasing marginal effect of interventions should be presented in a formal way.</p>
              <p>A graphical explanation of intuition for the results would improve the understanding of that part.</p>
              <p>General remarks regarding the organization of the paper:</p>
              <p>I don’t fully understand the motivation of the authors to move the calibration section to the appendix. It seems that the calibration is a fundamental part of the methods section. Moreover, the presence of the calibration sections in the appendix makes it difficult for the reader to understand the various abbreviations and references that appear later on.</p>
              <p>Additionally, the section that discusses simulation runs should be a part of the methods section. The “Decreasing marginal effect of interventions” and “Intuition for these results” subsections should be a part of the discussion, as they reflect upon the results and do not report them.</p>

              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>

              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The revision addressed most of my raised points from my review. However, I still see some possible drawbacks of the proposed method, which I would like to be replied to before advising for its publication:</p>
              <p>- I like the added section on Out-of-Sample prediction; however, some benchmark comparison to other models (SEIR or mechanistic models, like yesterday is today) would be interesting.</p>
              <p>- Why was the RMSLE used for prediction? As far as I know, this is no standard measure. Why not use the RMSE or some proper scoring rule?</p>
              <p>- Could you add some explanation or comments on two findings of the predictive assessment: Why is the prediction error in the first run under frozen activity levels so high? And it also seems as if updating the activity levels did, in fact, not lead to a better performance in all runs. What does this tell us about the model? Maybe some plots on how the activities changed in that time would be a starting point for the explanation?</p>
              <p>- Generally, the size of the Figures should be consistent. Fig. 17 is a lot smaller than, e.g., Fig. 18</p>
              <p>- While I admire the additional work put into extending the paper, I believe that 30 Pages is too long for the main article. I would put some parts of the discussion into the Appendix and most parts of the Appendix into an Online Supplementary Material (if this is possible with Plos One). Maybe also some of the cut discussion from the previous sections “Using mobile device data to observe changes of mobility behavior during COVID-19” and “From reductions of mobility behavior to reductions of infections” could be interesting in the Appendix of the Paper.</p>
              <p>- For completeness, a short explanation of the Whitepaper of the Senozon Method in English (the language of the article itself) would be helpful. Besides, some rationale and legitimisation would benefit the article on why a model for transportation is also suitable for modelling COVID hospitalisation</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: I have read the authors reviewed manuscript and responses and find them satisfactory. Therefore, I recommend accepting the manuscript for publication.</p>
