              <abstract>
                <p>The present study aimed to investigate the epidemiological situation of leprosy
(Hansen’s Disease), in a hyperendemic metropolis in the Central-West region of
Brazil. We studied trends over eleven years, both in the detection of the
disease and in disabilities, analyzing disparities and/or differences regarding
gender and age. This is an ecological time series study conducted in Cuiabá,
capital of the state of Mato Grosso. The population consisted of patients
diagnosed with leprosy between the years 2008 and 2018. The time series of
leprosy cases was used, stratifying it according to gender (male and female),
disability grade (G0D, G1D, G2D, and not evaluated) and age. The calendar
adjustment technique was applied. For modeling the trends, the Seasonal-Trend
decomposition procedure based on Loess (STL) was used. We identified 9.739
diagnosed cases, in which 58.37% were male and 87.55% aged between 15 and 59
years. Regarding detection according to gender, there was a decrease among women
and an increase in men. The study shows an increasing trend in disabilities in
both genders, which may be related to the delay in diagnosis. There was also an
increasing number of cases that were not assessed for disability at the time of
diagnosis, which denotes the quality of the services.</p>

                <title>Author summary</title>
                <p>In the 2019 report, Brazil had a detection rate of 13.23 per 100.000 inhabitants
far from the goal of less than 1 leprosy (Hansen’s Disease) case per 10,000
inhabitants describe by the World Health Organization. The present study aimed
to investigate the epidemiological situation of leprosy and its trend between
2008 and 2018 in a hyperendemic metropolis in the Central-West region of Brazil.
A total of 9.739 leprosy cases were reported between 2008 and 2018. The majority
of cases were male (58.37%), with a predominant age of 15 to 59 years (87.55%).
The predominant level of education was incomplete elementary school (43.96%).
The disability grade at diagnosis showed that 40.19% had G0D and for the G2D was
8,.06%.There was a predominance in operational classification of multibacillary
cases (72.85%). While detection rate trends in females and the majority of the
age groups are decreasing, increases are seen in the detection of male patients
and patients already suffering from disabilities. Although declining trends were
presented, the metropolis is still not close to elimination showing the need
prioritize leprosy actions and to improve care for this disease.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Leprosy, also called Hansen’s Disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by
<italic toggle="yes">Mycobacterium leprae</italic>, which affects Schwann cells, causing
their destruction, affecting the skin, and resulting in severe neuropathies, which
can lead to physical disabilities [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the past 30 years, the World Health Organization (WHO) has sought
measures to eliminate leprosy, and although its indicators have been decreasing over
the years, the goal of elimination (prevalence &lt;1 case per 10.000 inhabitants)
has not yet been reached and currently seems to be more distant than imagined [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p>According to WHO 2020 Weekly epidemiological record Global leprosy, India, Brazil and
Indonesia reported &gt;10,000 new cases in 2019, classifying them as the three most
highly endemic countries [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].
In 2019, Brazil had a detection rate of 13.23 per 100.000 inhabitants [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>WHO stated in the “Towards zero leprosy Global leprosy (Hansen’s Disease) strategy
2021–2030” [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], that the main
actions to control the disease should be directed towards leprosy prevention
upscaling alongside integrated active case detection, leprosy disease management and
its complications and prevent new disability and combat stigma and ensure human
rights are respected. Interruption of transmission and elimination of disease are at
the core of their strategy document, as well as of the WHO “Guidelines for the
Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Leprosy” [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>Brazil is a country of continental proportions, which makes leprosy control a major
challenge. It is divided into five macro-regions, of which the Central-West is one
of the most problematic regions in terms of the burden of the disease. A study
carried out in that region showed that in the trienniums of 2001–2003 and 2010–2012,
there was a reduction in the disease; however, there are geographical areas where
leprosy control has not advanced and these locations are far from elimination [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>The official reports from Brazil indicate the reduction of leprosy in general, but
there is evidence that there is gender inequity in access to health services [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Another issue refers to
age, as there is evidence that the population aging process is changing the profile
of the leprosy morbidity profile, given the number of people falling ill in a
context of poverty and inequality, with older adults having more difficulty in
accessing health services and tending to have a more unfavorable prognosis [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This needs to be better
addressed from the perspective of health surveillance.</p>
              <p>Also, regarding the inequality related to age, it is known that when there is a delay
in diagnosis, children who had contact with index cases also become ill, which is an
important gap to be filled [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Accordingly, the elimination of leprosy involves comprehending the
determinants, according to a gender and age equity perspective. It is also
understood that gender and age inequity should not be analyzed only from the
perspective of detection, but also in terms of disability, as the WHO recognizes the
disability grade indicator as the most sensitive measure of the real leprosy
situation in a community [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
              <p>There are hypotheses that there are gender differences, and that older adults and
children are more severely affected by the disease, with regard to disabilities
[<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These aspects need to be studied in order
to define public health policies and plan strategic actions in priority areas, as
well as to advance equity. There are several tools that could be used to test these
hypotheses; among them, one of the more sensitive tools is the time series. Its use
is justified in the field of public health, as it can show the trend of the disease
in vulnerable groups and verify how much success has been achieved in terms of the
goal of elimination and reduction of injustices and/or inequity [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological situation of leprosy and trends
in the detection of cases and disabilities, and to evidence disparities and/or
differences regarding gender and age in a hyperendemic metropolis in Central-West
Brazil.</p>

for women and 4.79% for men, a life expectancy at birth of 75 years of age, and
a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.785. It also has a Gini index of 0.59, an
indicator that measures how equitably a resource is distributed in a population;
the nearest to 0 is the population with lowest inequality, and closest to 1 is
the most unequal [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
                <p>Regarding basic sanitation, 53.52% of Cuiabá’s territory has a sewage network and

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Initially, the variables of interest were standardized, with data relating to
age, gender, and education considered in the sociodemographic dimension and
operational classification, clinical form, and disability grade at diagnosis in
the clinical-epidemiological dimension. Descriptive analysis of the
sociodemographic and clinical-epidemiological variables was performed.</p>
                <p>Next, the time series of leprosy cases were constructed according to the total
number of cases [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], gender (male and
female), and disability grade (G0D, G1D, G2D, and not evaluated).</p>
                <p>For the construction of the time series, the general rates of detection and those
stratified by gender were calculated, considering the total population of the
municipality (for general detection rate) and the populations of men and women
(for rates stratified according to gender) as the denominator, all with a
multiplication factor per 100,.000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>After the construction of the time series, according to detection in general by
gender, age, and disability grade, the evolutions of the trends were calculated
using the Seasonal-Trend decomposition procedure based on Loess (STL) [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This methodology is
based on the classic decomposition of time series that disaggregates the total
series into three additive components (trend, seasonality or error), allowing
each of these components to be separately estimated and identifying the source
of variability of the series in a more concise way than through a global
analysis of the series. The STL has a simple design that consists of a sequence
of applications of the Loess, allowing analysis of the properties of the
procedure and quick calculations [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
                <p>One of the advantages of this methodology is that it is quite robust regarding
the existence of outliers. ‘Trend’ refers to the general direction in which the
variables of the time series develop, according to a time interval, presenting a
pattern of increase/decrease of the variable over a certain period.
‘Seasonality’ is reflected in identical patterns that a time series seems follow
and that occur regularly at fixed periods of time. Finally, ‘noise’ is the
fluctuations that occur over the time of the series, visualized as irregular and
random movements perceptible only with the removal of the other components
[<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
                <p>Having estimated the three components of the time series, only the trend was
selected to characterize the trend of the variables of interest over time.
Subsequently, the Average Monthly Percentage Change (AMPC) was calculated for
the trends in the general detection rates by gender and cases with disability
grade identifying the mean percentages and how much the trends increased or
decreased over the study period. Finally, the trends of the disability rates in
various groups were also analyzed. All analyses were performed using the R
Studio version 3.5.2 statistical software.</p>

              <p>Regarding the clinical variables, there was predominance in operational
classification of multibacillary cases (72.85%), and for the clinical form by
borderline cases (56.83%). The disability grade at diagnosis showed that 40.19% had
G0D, followed by 30.45% that were not evaluated, 21.3% with G1D and 8.06% with
G2D.</p>
              <p>According to the results, for the detection rates (<xref rid="pntd.0009941.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) there
was a decreasing trend in the general detection rate and for the reported female
cases, and an increasing trend for male cases (0.01%).</p>

in the structure of the time series of the total detection rate of leprosy cases.
Three changes of structure are verified in the series; the first occurred in
November 2011, in which the series shows a marked decrease until the year 2013. The
second change in structure occurred in August 2013, with an increase in the time
series, presenting the highest values in the years 2014 and 2015, with a detection
rate of more than 20 cases per 100.000 inhabitants. From October 2015 onwards, the
last change in structure occurred, with a decrease and later stability in the
detection rate values until the end of the series.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The present study aimed to investigate the epidemiological situation of leprosy, its
trend over the years, and whether there were trends, both in the detection of the
disease and in disabilities, analyzing disparities and/or differences regarding
gender and age in a hyperendemic metropolis in the Central-West region of
Brazil.</p>
              <p>The study showed that leprosy has been declining in the research area; however, when
analyzed according to gender, age and disabilities, we observed that the leprosy
affects men, children under 15 years and elderly people unequally, with an increase
in disabilities, raising the hypothesis that late diagnosis and underreporting may
be occurring, revealing a possible weakness of the health services in Cuiabá [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
              <p>A current ally to fight leprosy is leprosy chemoprophylaxis. According to the WHO
guidelines, single-dose rifampicin (SDR) as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can be
used in children and adults [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In a randomized controlled trial, SDR given to leprosy contacts
provided a reduction in leprosy risk of 57% in 2 years and 30% in 5–6 years [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As leprosy is a highly
stigmatized disease, revealing the identity of the index patient when implementing
this preventive therapy for contacts should be handled with care and only after
gaining consent, especially when this takes place outside the patient’s family.</p>
              <p>The result that men are more affected than women has also been found in other studies
[<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This can be related to several factors,
such as being less concerned about their own health and difficulties for men to
access public health services [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].
Currently, there are few health policies aimed at this population to meet their
needs [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Barriers related
to the difficulty of access to health services, the incompatibility between the
hours of operation of health units and the workday, and the belief of being less
susceptible to the disease in comparison with women may contribute to this greater
burden of leprosy in the male population [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
              <p>Most of the cases had incomplete elementary education, an indicator of low schooling,
which may be related to the social aspect and living conditions. Low levels of
education hinder access to better jobs and better economic conditions [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
              <p>The predominance of multibacillary cases, with the most severe clinical forms
(especially borderline and lepromatous cases), may suggest the occurrence of active
transmission of the disease and, consequently, greater potential to incapacitate the
affected individuals [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>
              <p>In relation to children under 15 years of age, when analyzing the disability grade,
there were growing trends in the number of G1D and G2D in this age group, which may
indicate that the municipality faces difficulties in the early diagnosis of the
disease and ongoing transmission. A study by Xavier et al. (2014) with children
under 15 years of age indicated that the early exposure to the pathogen in this age
group suggests a late diagnosis and prolonged exposure [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The fact that there are any G2D in
children is concerning, as it falls far short of the WHO goal for zero disability in
children [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, people who
are affected by multibacillary forms of the disease have a greater chance of
developing health problems… Leprosy is highly disabling when not properly treated in
this population, which can influence academic school performance (and future
occupation) and cause problems related to social limitations, discrimination,
self-esteem, and stigma experienced by the affected person, especially because this
is a period of growth and physical and emotional development [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>
              <p>In the state of Mato Grosso in 2015, the National Campaign for Leprosy,
Geohelminthiasis and Trachoma [“Campanha Nacional de Hanseníase, Verminoses, Tracoma
e Esquistossomose”] was initiated, which mobilized local health services to execute
actions related to the active search for cases, focusing on schoolchildren aged 5 to
14 years. The campaign was carried out in approximately 915 schools in 65
municipalities (including Cuiabá), to examine and treat more than 291.200 students
and their possible contacts [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is estimated that the campaign may have had an impact in the
region studied, reflecting the peak of detection verified in the study for this age
group. No further policies were encountered in public archives to influence the
detection of leprosy in the region during the time period.</p>
              <p>Regarding the age group of 15 to 29 years, despite presenting a decreasing trend in
the case detection rate, it should be noted that G1D and G2D ended the series with
increasing trends. These results can be strong indications of late diagnosis and the
existence of underreported of cases [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], since the
decrease in the detection rate of new cases is not accompanied by the decrease of
cases with disability grade. This constitutes a warning about possible difficulties
of health services in detecting patients early and conducting adequate active case
finding activities [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p>
              <p>The group aged 30 to 59 years ended the time series with an increasing trend in the
detection rate of new cases, as well as in G1D. This age group is composed of the
economically active population, where the disabilities and incapacities caused by
leprosy affect the work and social life environments, causing not only economic
losses for the individual and his or her community but also psychological losses
[<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p>
              <p>The older adult age group (aged 60 years or more) had a decreasing trend in the rate
of detection of new cases and increasing values in G1D and G2D. As stated, the
antagonism between the decrease in the detection rate and the increase in
disabilities is a strong indication of difficulties in the active search for cases
and the possibility of underreporting [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>
              <p>The issue of not evaluating cases for disability showed an increasing trend over the
study period. The assessment of physical disability at the time of diagnosis is a
priority action for newly diagnosed leprosy cases, and the fact that
‘non-evaluation’ presents an increasing trend may raise discussions regarding the
management of leprosy cases in the research setting. According to the Ministry of
Health quality control, at least 75.00% of new cases at the time of diagnosis need
to be evaluated for the disability grade and registered into SINAN [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the Official Epidemiologic Bulletin of
Cuiabá of the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 health units evaluated a mean of 56.24% G2D
registration of new cases at the time of diagnosis, below expectations [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The authors of this study
emphasize that a 100% of disability grade assessment and registration at time of
diagnosis, as well as for disease progression evaluation, should be pursued.</p>
              <p>These findings lead us to suppose that the assessment and registration of leprosy
patients at health care level or in the national surveillance system had not been
carried out systematically, with the number of unevaluated cases often showing a
lack of adherence, unpreparedness, and a lack of standardized protocols that guide
the classification and registration, of both the clinical leprosy form and its
disability grade.</p>
              <p>Leprosy affects men and women, age groups and social classes in different ways, it
emerges from inequality and produces more inequality among the affected populations.
In addition to this discussion, it can also be defined as neglected, both by public
policies and health authorities, with regards to incorporating it into priority
investment actions, considering that it affects the most marginalized populations
and those in situations of extreme vulnerability [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p>
              <p>If there is a clear intention to overcome leprosy, investments in health care and
different methodological approaches must be considered, in both research, health
service delivery and the surveillance system of health systems and territories. The
elimination of leprosy involves comprehending the differences in gender issues and
life stages in the health territories, and the elaboration of intervention projects
aimed to target risk groups must be sufficiently supported by scientific and
operational evidence.</p>
              <p>Guiding public policies based on this evidence is essential for advancing equity and
eliminating leprosy. Actions are needed to support health care providers to
correctly evaluate disabilities. Active case finding activities can result into
higher patient detection rates, and in addition, the search and follow-up of patient
contacts must also be promoted. As mentioned, SDR-PEP could be studied by policy
makers and/or health care managers, to be implemented in their context based on the
WHO’s recommendations and the effectiveness and feasibility as reported in the
literature [<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0009941.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p>
              <p>A limitation of this study is that the database used is secondary, so it may contain
inconsistent information regarding quantity and quality with presence of data that
were potentially ignored or incomplete, data regarding the operational
classification and clinical leprosy registration form were, in some cases, not
filled completely. Another limitation involved STL, which is only a visual resource
for showing findings and does not having a "measure" of increase or decrease. AMPC
is based on a percentage, which is why it does not contain a p-value or 95%
confidence interval. In the data, we encountered some operational classification
with incompatibility with clinical form, such as ‘indeterminate’ being classified as
‘multibacillary’ cases, thus having to add ‘not classified/incomplete’ on
operational classification. Not all clinical forms were filled in the databank
contrary to the operational classification, causing disparities. The number of
children with G2D in the trends is small and thus might not be able to show a clear
trend. The interpretation of these data cannot be understood at the individuals’
level.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the present study highlights the need to prioritize leprosy active
case finding activities to foster early detection, to improve the care for this
disease, as well as to develop strategies for leprosy prevention and health care
strengthening.</p>

              <p>
                <bold>Key Review Criteria Required for Acceptance?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>As you describe the new analyses required for acceptance, please consider the
following:</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Methods</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis
stated?</p>
              <p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p>
              <p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being
tested?</p>
              <p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis
being tested?</p>
              <p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p>
              <p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: methods are well explained and appropriate for this study</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Information on the objectives of the study is clear, ethical approval
was obtained. See full comments below in the Methods section.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The objectives of the study are clearly articulated with a clear
testable hypothesis stated.</p>
              <p>The study design is appropriate to address the stated objectives.</p>
              <p>The population is clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being
tested.</p>
              <p>Since all the population is included in the study, there is no sample size issue.</p>
              <p>The statistical analysis is corrected for supporting the conclusions.</p>
              <p>But: (1) Please include the diagnosis criterion of leprosy for better under standing.
(2) Please clarify the mobile population for analysis since it could be a
confounding factor for the result. (3) Is there any policy change for leprosy which
could influence the detection of leprosy. (4) The method of Seasonal-Trend
decomposition procedure based on Loess (STL) can be described more clearly for
better understanding by readers.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: This is an interesting exercise made possible by the comprehensive SINAN
database in Brazil. The authors have given much emphasis to the statistical analysis
of trends. I believe the statistical approach is generally valid and the analysis
well-performed, but there are some unclarities:</p>
              <p>1) Please provide the definition used in Brazil for hyper endemic. For international
use, consider to just state 'highly endemic' and use this term as well in the title,
instead of 'hyper endemic'.</p>
              <p>2) There is quite some 'fog' in relation to disability grade, its registration and
the way it was dealt with in the analysis. Lines 152-154 are unclear; e.g. what does
'below expectations' mean. Also the sentence in lines 188-190 is unclear. What total
number? And how does this translate in the results? There I see a breakdown by
disability grade and 'not registered'. With the great uncertainty with regard to the
indicator disability grade, why do you not just take 'grade 0' and 'joint grade 1
and 2' in the trend analysis, and ignore the 'not evaluated'?</p>
              <p>3) I think very important information is missing necessary for interpreting trends,
namely operational changes in the leprosy control program, or for that matter the
health system in general. The total leprosy detection over the ten years is rather
spiky. It comes down between 2008 and 2012, increases and decreases steeply between
2012 and 2016, and then increases again to reach possibly a plateau. The health
system (or other operational changes) during this time need to be described in some
detail in the methods section under a separate heading. This is essential context to
understand and interprete the trends.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #5: There is too much background information in the methods – make this more
concise, especially the parts about the “study design and research scenario”. Also,
in English, we generally don’t say “Research scenario”. I would say “Study Design
and Setting”.</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Results</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p>
              <p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: well presented and relevant information provided</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The result section is clearly written. I would suggest to use not only
colours, but also a different line appearance in the table to make them more clear
for readers who are printing the tables in black/white. Please also see my comments
below on the Results section.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The analysis presented matches the analysis plan.</p>
              <p>The results are clearly and completely presented.</p>
              <p>But: A standardized population need to be provided and calulated for the age and
gender groups.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: With regard to the case characteristics (table 1) there is some
unclarity about operational classification and clinical form. PB (26.67%) seems to
be the sum of I and TT clinical forms (26.88%), but not just the same. In the
sentence starting on line 237 it states: "... there was a predominance of
multibacillary cases (73.33%), followed by borderline cases (57.00%)". But
borderline cases are part of MB... </p>
              <p>With regard to presentation of trends, I would first like to see the figure
'Detection total' separately with under the time line some bars or arrows indicating
important operational changes in time. See for instance the figure A in the
following article for inspiration <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.cell.com/trends/molecular-medicine/fulltext/S1471-4914" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.cell.com/trends/molecular-medicine/fulltext/S1471-4914</ext-link>(20)30065-4.
In that way the overall trend is placed in context of the most important operational
factors influencing the trend. </p>
              <p>Table 2 summarizes the main findings of the trend figures 2-5. You could therefore
consider to place all these figures in an appendix.</p>
              <p>In table 2, make sure to give the full name of the abbreviation AMPC. Furthermore, as
reader I need help to understand the importance of the figures under AMPC. Under the
heading Trend you state Increasing or Decreasing. But is there a way to indicate a
measure of increase or decrease, for instance through a p-value? And how do you
establish the importance of a trend. When is the trend such, that you want to
highlight it as an important result and discuss its implications. And when is it
just some irrelevant 'noise'.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #5: 1. I don’t think G0D (as opposed to G1D and G2D for grade 1 and grade2)
is an accepted acronym for “no disability” and it’s confusing to say that G0D is
decreasing – G0D in effect is “NO disability”. I would use a different way of
describing it because if you read it quickly you may think that some disability is
decreasing whereas what you are saying is that people presenting without disability
is actually decreasing among many groups which is very concerning. </p>
              <p>For all “G0D”, I would substitute “No disability”</p>
              <p>2. I know that Asian descent for race translates to “amarelo” in Portuguese, but many
English language readers would find “Yellow” offensive, so I would change that to
Asian descent. </p>
              <p>3. Lines 237-238: You wouldn’t really say “followed by borderline cases”, since they
are part of two different categories, just state these separately.</p>
              <p>Figures overall seem ok, but would change the G0D label as per above.</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Conclusions</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p>
              <p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of
the topic under study?</p>
              <p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: In the discussion, I am missing the role of leprosy prevention as
post-exposure chemoprophylaxis with a single dose of rifampicin (SDR-PEP) for
contacts of leprosy contacts, in combination with contact screening / active case
finding. This is a very important strategy for decreasing the number of new cases /
case detection delay / disability etc. For example in Brazil, a current research
project is ongoing studying advanced chemoprophylaxis regimen (PEP++). But the
evidence from e.g. COLEP &amp; LPEP regarding SDR-PEP is clear and it is also
included in the WHO Leprosy Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention
of Leprosy. You could add this as reconmendation. </p>
              <p>Including 1 study limitation may be a bit limited.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The conclusions are supported by the data presented.</p>
              <p>The limitations of the study are addressed.</p>
              <p>Public health relevance is addressed.</p>
              <p>The authors need to discuss in more detail to help readers understanding the
result.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: To start with, cut the discussion by at least 50%. It is far too long
and therefore unclear. In the discussion state first what you consider the really
most important findings of your study. Which trends are really relevant in terms of
being unexpected, undesired and amendable to health care interventions?</p>
              <p>After stating the most important findings, only then start with some explanation and
interpretation. Make clear that you are discussing everything against the Brazilian
background. You use the term 'global' at a certain point, but I understand it to
mean Brazil as a whole and not the world. Here it is also important to take into
account the operational factors, that you have now incorporated in the new figure
1.</p>
              <p>Much of the disparities are due to delayed detection, which may apply more strongly
to e.g. women and people in the working age. This is also related to stigma. Try to
bring that together in the discussion more comprehensively, instead of just going
along the different groups (gender, age and disability) in order of appearance in
analysis.</p>
              <p>Whereas the general discussion text should be much shorter, the paragraph on
strengths and weaknesses should be a more detailed.</p>
              <p>Finally, the conclusion is very general. Can you make it a bit more specific, based
on your findings? Just one or two sentences more.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #5: 1. Line 288 Again, do not say “grade 0 disabilities” are decreasing.
That’s misleading. Grade 0 means there is no disability, so you shouldn’t describe
it like that. You should say that the rates of new diagnosis without disability is
decreasing. </p>
              <p>2. Gender differences – I think you are missing discussion of a potentially big
reason for differences in gender that has been proposed – that women are not seeking
care for their leprosy, possibly due to more PB in women than men so
underrecognition or possibly due to stigma (reference: Factors preventing early case
detection for women affected by leprosy: a review of the literature. Price VG.Glob
Health Action. 2017 Jan-Dec;10(sup2):1360550. doi:
10.1080/16549716.2017.1360550.PMID: 28853325 )</p>
              <p>3. The discussion is too long – you should summarize the different age time series
more succinctly and in 1-2 paragraphs and not just repeat your results. </p>
              <p>4. There is no discussion on the limitations of this study – one big thing, which you
can tell from the figures, is that the number of children with grade 2 disability is
actually quite small so it may not be able to tell a clear trend. However, the fact
that there are any G2D in children is concerning, and at odds with the WHO goals for
zero disability in children &lt; 15 (you should mention these goals in the
discussion).</p>

                <bold>Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications
of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are
minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend “Minor Revision” or “Accept”. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: ABSTRACT:</p>
              <p>32-35: First sentence in abstract is quite long, change this into 2 sentences to
increase readability.</p>
              <p>35-36: Second sentence in abstract is incorrect. Start the sentence with e.g. “This
is a …”</p>
              <p>45-46: In the abstract it is stated “Regarding detection according to gender, there
was a decrease among women”, but “by evidencing a increasing trend of leprosy cases
among women” (47-48). This seems contradictive, please make some changes. It should
also be ”aN increasing trend”.</p>
              <p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
              <p>60: In introduction, I would advise to change “which lead to physical disabilities”
into “which can lead to physical disabilities”. </p>
              <p>61: Please remove “skin contact” in “skin contact or other means cannot be excluded”,
the evidence for skin contact is low (i.e. using a tattoo needle in a leprosy patch
and next tattooing another person with the same needle is risky, but not normal skin
contact and rare of course) and stating it like this can sound stigmatizing for some
people. </p>
              <p>65: Reference numbers should be placed before/after (depending on reference style)
punctuation marks. In this case: before a comma (,) or full stop/period (.), not in
the middle of a sentence. Please move [2,3] to after “imagined”.</p>
              <p>67: “In 2016, according to WGHO data, 143 countries…” -&gt; This data is a bit
outdates, especially because your data reflected in the time series study is ranging
from 2008-2018. Please use WHO data from 2018 (or even 2019) here. </p>
              <p>72: It seems like you are referring to both North and South America, so it should be
continentS.</p>
              <p>77: “preventing cases with grade of disability” should be “preventing cases with
disabilities”.</p>
              <p>79: Please remove the capital at “The Plan” -&gt; “The plan” or even better, change
it to “The strategy”.</p>
              <p>89: Place a comma after “2010-2012”.</p>
              <p>102-107: This is also the case because you cannot count ‘undetected cases’.</p>
              <p>105: “disabilitie” should be “disability”.</p>
              <p>111: the word “public” is missing: “define public policies” -&gt; “define public
health policies”.</p>
              <p>113: the word “tools” is missing: “more sensitive is the time series” -&gt; “more
sensitive tools is the time series”.</p>
              <p>METHODS</p>
              <p>129: when including such an exact number as 3,266,538 km2, I would suggest to remove
the word “approximately”.</p>
              <p>138: Explain shortly what Gini index is.</p>
              <p>140. full stop is missing after “[17,18]”</p>
              <p>140-141: capital usage is incorrect, please check. I would suggest to remove most of
the capitals used in this sentence.</p>
              <p>145-146: same point regarding the capitals, I would suggest to remove most of the
capitals used in this sentence.</p>
              <p>153-154: which expectations are meant here? Where does 75.00% come from?</p>
              <p>STUDY POPULATION AND INFORMATION SOURCES</p>
              <p>164: I do understand why you included this (race/skin color), and the explanation on
this in the discussion is very clear and correct. But when people are reading this
in the Methods section, it is a bit in your face. Registering this data should be
avoided or happen very carefully from an ethical perspective, as it may sound like
ethical profiling / offensive / discriminatory to some people. The colors as
outlined here (“white, black, yellow, mixed, and indigenous”) is not ethical
preferred. Starting with white is tricky (also now with Black Lives Matter),
alphabetical order would be better. I would include information that people had to
register their own race (instead of the health professionals / researchers
registering it, because it is hard to judge whether someone is mixed or black for
example). I would remove it completely from the article. If you want to leave it in,
I would suggest to more clearly explain also in the Methods section that this is
registered in the national leprosy system and that this is outdated or not found to
be ethical anymore and why this data can still be important and change/remove this
listing of skin tones. </p>
              <p>181/189/192/212/214/215: Grade of Disability is sometimes written with capitals and
sometimes without, I would suggest to write it without capitals. I also prefer
“disability grade” over “grade of disability”.</p>
              <p>202-206: I would use “” or ‘’ for the words you are defining: ‘Trend’, ‘Seasonality’,
‘noise’.</p>
              <p>RESULTS:</p>
              <p>229 &amp; Table &amp; 321: see comments above about “race/skin color”</p>
              <p>235 &amp; 262: Delete “Source: Authors”. If there is no other source included, it is
clear it is from the authors.</p>
              <p>238/240/241-242/245/Table 2/260/262/264/268/268/271/274/354/372: See comment above:
“Grade of Disability” -&gt; “disability grade”.</p>
              <p>243: full stop missing after “Fig”.</p>
              <p> Table 2: “General Population”-&gt; “General population”.</p>
              <p>Fig. 2/3/4/5: It may be nice to use strips/dots for one of the lines in the graphs
(e.g. the red one) besides a color difference, so people who print it black &amp;
white can still see the color difference.</p>
              <p>279 &amp; 339 &amp; 434: I would suggest a different word here, as “behavior“ is more
suitable for humans/animals, go for e.g. “trend” here instead.</p>
              <p>280 &amp; 289: “and or” should be “and/or”.</p>
              <p>297: remove “the” before “: disability”.</p>
              <p>299: Remove “The” before “literature”.</p>
              <p>300: Maybe add reference here, as “literature” sounds like plural.</p>
              <p>308: Possibly remove “various”.</p>
              <p>310: you could replace “published works” by simply staying “studies”.</p>
              <p>311: what is meant here by “risky situations”? It this referring to getting infected?
As prolonged contact is needed, I would not call this “risky situations” (also
sounds a bit stigmatizing), or is it referring to possible damage to the hands
because of work related accidents or so? I would delete “risky situations” or
rephrase and explain it.</p>
              <p>313-314: at least 2 references seem to be missing, as you are talking about evidence
from the 90ies and current policies.</p>
              <p>343: add the word “the” between “regarding” and “detection”.</p>
              <p>343 &amp; 354: add “years of age” after “15”.</p>
              <p>348-349: word repetition “carry out”, if you like, change for executed/organized…</p>
              <p>357 &amp; 377: reference location not correct (should be at end of sentence or before
comma).</p>
              <p>357-360: what do you mean here by the statement that “early exposure” leads to
disabilities? Because of the length of the exposure/infection period (although, they
were still children at time of diagnosis, so it cannot be decades for example) or is
it because their bodies were still developing biologically at that age. Or both?</p>
              <p>362: I would change “academic performance” into “school performance”, as “academic”
often refers to university level.</p>
              <p>383: delete commas around “as well as”.</p>
              <p>384: “incapacity” –&gt; “incapacities”.</p>
              <p>400: change the word “scenario” into “setting”.</p>
              <p>400: you may like to add “registration at health care level/national surveillance
system”.</p>
              <p>402: you may like to add “lack of adherence”.</p>
              <p>408: “a way of” sounds a bit informal, you could replace it for “a method of”.</p>
              <p>421-422: change “does not behave in a homogenous way” into “disease trend is not
homogenous”.</p>
              <p>427: what is meant by “promotion actions”? Awareness raising? Self care? Please
explain.</p>
              <p>431 &amp; 432: I don’t think “State” should be capitalized here.</p>
              <p>432: “State protection” has a double definition (also a negative one), I would
replace it for “state support”.</p>
              <p>434: 432-435: references are missing, as you are referring to multiple studies and
WHO reports.</p>
              <p>435: delete “which is true”, as you need to have verified all these studies/data to
know for sure.</p>
              <p>435: a decrease in new cases can also be caused by a lack of active case finding
activities, and this, is not always a ‘positive’ finding.</p>
              <p>445: usually, multiple limitations (at least 2) are named.</p>
              <p>Say something on post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) as prevention strategy for leprosy
(see my comment above) in the discussion section. </p>
              <p>REFERENCES:</p>
              <p>Reference 1 (457) and reference 5 are the same, though 2 difference websites are
used. Please replace reference 1 with number 5 (2018 WHO is the correct reference
for the WHO Leprosy Guidelines).</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: The first paragraph of the introduction is rather outdated. Please use
2019 WHO data and also refer to the latest WHO strategic document for leprosy.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #5: The paper needs some work before publication, especially in its length,
which I think can be shortened, and in the English / writing in certain places. I
found a few typos as well. It needs a thorough review for English language editing,
spelling, typos before publication. I also didn't see cover letter or summary which
was unusual.</p>

study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also
include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual
publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision,

              <p>Reviewer #1: I enjoyed reading this and reviewing this manuscript. It is a master
piece in social sciences in medicine and it reveals the fallacy of the academic
imperlalism by the "experts" drinking latte in European countries dictaing polices
in coutnries where leprosy is a major public health concern. This publication is a
clear demonstration of the poor decision meaking of public health organizations. The
only thing that the elimination campign of leprosy did, was the elimination of
attention to major chronic infectious disease that causes severe disability. It was
an honor to review this paper.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Very nice article and an important topic. Please make some editorial
changes (see full comments), and pay extra attention to capital usage. Also, be
careful with the section on race/skin color (especially in the Methods section) as
this is a sensitive topic. See if you can add another limitation and add
chemoprophylaxis for leprosy in your recommendations. Also please do check the
reference list again and add a few extra references in the text (see comments).</p>
              <p>Reviewer #5: This study is a straightforward analysis of epidemiologic data on
leprosy from the SINAN data base and uses a time series analysis that really studies
the trends over time of the 3 key epidemiologic indicators for leprosy: 1. New case
detection rate, 2. Pediatric cases, 3. New grade 2 disability. Using a hyperendemic
city is a really nice way to not only show concerning trends in this area, but to
model ways that we can study other geographic areas. These findings are very
important because it shows that the decreasing incidence does not tell the whole
study and that different age / sex can be impacted differently and may need
different control strategies. The paper needs some work before publication,
especially in its length, which I think can be shortened, and in the English /
writing in certain places.</p>

              <p>As you describe the new analyses required for acceptance, please consider the
following:</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Methods</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis
stated?</p>
              <p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p>
              <p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being
tested?</p>
              <p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis
being tested?</p>
              <p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p>
              <p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: OK</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: TITLE: </p>
              <p>- "hyperendemic" is written with space in the rest of the manuscript, but without in
the title</p>
              <p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
              <p>- Most changes made were appreciated.</p>
              <p>- See my suggested changes and comments in the text file attached. </p>
              <p>- Please include the latest version oif the WHO Global Leprosy Strategy
(2021-2030).</p>
              <p>- I would delete: "Also, regarding the inequality related to age, it is known that
when there is a delay in diagnosis, children that who had contact with index cases
can also become ill [1112], which is an important gap to be filled."</p>
              <p>METHODS:</p>
              <p>- Most changes made were appreciated.</p>
              <p>- See my suggested changes and comments in the text file attached. </p>
              <p>- You could think of adding a definition table with an overview of the disability
grades (what is G0D, G1D, G2D)</p>
              <p>- Capital usage still not fully correct</p>
              <p>- This sentence is unclear: "Regarding the disability gradethe grade of disability,
health units evaluated a mean of 56.24% of new cases with a disability at the time
of diagnosis, below expectations, which was listsed as should be at least 75.00%
according to SINAN [235, 26]." </p>
              <p>- I donnot understand this sentence because of the level of English, you can maybe
also delete it: "For the construction of time series of the cases with disability
grade we considered all the number of cases with disability grade (G0D, G1D, G2D,
and not evaluated)."</p>
              <p>- This is also quite vague, could it be deleted? "... even for a very long time
series and large amounts of trend and seasonal smoothing, a very small amount of
trend smoothing, and seasonal components that are not distorted by aberrant behavior
in the data ability to decompose time series with missing values"</p>
              <p>- This should not be in the methods section, but in the discussion (is already
included there). Also, the word 'dubious' is too strong/incorrect: "Finally, we
mention that the notification forms are filled out by third parties, so dubious data
may be provided."</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The objectives of the study are clearly articulated with a clear
testable hypothesis stated. The study is design appropriate to address the stated
objectives. The population is clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis
being tested. The sample size is sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the
hypothesis being tested.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: See attachment</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Results</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p>
              <p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: OK</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: - Changes made were appreciated.</p>
              <p>- 'ignored' is too strong in table 1, go for: 'not classified / incorrect /
incomplete' instead</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The analysis presented matches the analysis plan. The results are
clearly and completely presented.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: See attachment</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Conclusions</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p>
              <p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of
the topic under study?</p>
              <p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: OK</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: DISCUSSION:</p>
              <p>- Most changes made were appreciated.</p>
              <p>- See my suggested changes and comments in the text file attached. </p>
              <p>- Improvements can be made regarding: item order in the discussion, repetition, level
of English.</p>
              <p>- I would suggest to delete this, as it seems less relevant (not clearly explained
how this affects the leprosy programme) and the discussion word count is too high:
"In the state of Mato Grosso, in 2015, the “National Campaign for Leprosy,
Geohelminthiasis and Trachoma” was initiated, which mobilized local health services
to execute carry out actions related to the active search for cases, focusing on
schoolchildren, aged from 5 to 14 years. The campaign was carried out in
approximately 915 schools in 65 municipalities (including Cuiabá), to examine and
treat more than 291..200 thousand students and possibly their possible contacts
[242]. It is estimated that the campaign may have had an impact in the region
studied, reflecting the peak of detection verified in the study for this age group.
No further policies were encountered in public archives to influence the detection
of leprosy in the region duringh the time period."</p>
              <p>CONCLUSION:</p>
              <p>- See my suggested changes and comments in the text file attached.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The conclusions are supported by the data presented. The limitations of
the study are clearly described.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: See attachment</p>

              <p>
                <bold>Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications
of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are
minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend “Minor Revision” or “Accept”. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: OK</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: revision needed</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: I have made some edits to the text (attached, visible with track
changes). That is easier for me than repeating everything in this form one by
one.</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Summary and General Comments</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the
study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also
include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual
publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision,
please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: OK</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Improvements were made and are much appreciated. Nevertheless, the
manuscript still need to be revised. Especially the discussion needs attention, the
text order should be changed and repetition should be avoided. Both the introduction
and discussion section can be shorter and more to the point. The newly written text
segments need improvents regarding the level of English.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: The paper has improved well after a thorough revision. There are still
some small issues that I have addressed directly in the revised manuscript with
track changes visible. This is not intended as a full language edit, but just to
improve on some relatively important matters with regard to language and
explanation.</p>

              <p>Data Requirements:</p>
              <p>Please note that, as a condition of publication, PLOS' data policy requires that you
make available all data used to draw the conclusions outlined in your manuscript.
Data must be deposited in an appropriate repository, included within the body of the
manuscript, or uploaded as supporting information. This includes all numerical
values that were used to generate graphs, histograms etc.. For an example see here:
<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001908#s5" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001908#s5</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>Reproducibility:</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your
laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own
identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future.
Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study
protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
              <p>References</p>
              <p>Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you
have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing
so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant
current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the
rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript. If you need to cite a
retracted article, indicate the article's retracted status in the References list
and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p>

              <p>Dear Mr Martoreli Júnior,</p>
              <p>We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript 'Inequality of gender, age and
disabilities due to leprosy and trends in a hyperendemic metropolis: Evidence from
an eleven-year time series study in Central-West Brazil' has been provisionally
accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. However, Reviewer 2
still had a few more recommendations to improve the manuscript a little more. Please
make sure to address the comments from Reviewer 2 when preparing your mansucript for
publication.</p>
              <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some
formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. A member of our
team will be in touch with a set of requests.</p>
              <p>Please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have
made the required changes, so a swift response is appreciated.</p>
              <p>IMPORTANT: The editorial review process is now complete. PLOS will only permit
corrections to spelling, formatting or significant scientific errors from this point
onwards. Requests for major changes, or any which affect the scientific
understanding of your work, will cause delays to the publication date of your
manuscript.</p>
              <p>Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press
release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask
that you notify us now if you or your institution is planning to press release the
article. All press must be co-ordinated with PLOS.</p>
              <p>Thank you again for supporting Open Access publishing; we are looking forward to
publishing your work in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
              <p>Best regards,</p>
              <p>Alberto Novaes Ramos Jr</p>
              <p>Associate Editor</p>
              <p>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</p>
              <p>Hélène Carabin</p>
              <p>Deputy Editor</p>
              <p>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</p>
              <p>***********************************************************</p>
              <p>Make the minor changes indicated by the reviewer:</p>
              <p>"The manuscript has improved a lot and is, in my opinion, almost ready to be
published. Some relatively minor final comments:</p>
              <p>- Please check punctuation marks and paces use throughout the manuscript. Examples:
remove comma in sentence 51; parenthesis in sentence 143 should be placed after
'referrals' instead of 'rehabilitation'; remove full stop in sentence 317; remove
space in sentence 325 &amp; 397.</p>
              <p>- In table 'Table 1 - Disability grade and his characteristics', the word 'claw' at
hands &amp; feet at G2D can be seen as stigmatizing language. Better is
'contractures' or 'claw hand deformity'</p>
              <p>- The reference for 'WHO disability grading for leprosy' (part of Table 1) is:
<ext-link xlink:href="https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/42060" ext-link-type="uri">https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/42060</ext-link></p>
              <p>- The level of English could be improved at sentence 291-2: 'care should be taken to
reveal the identity of the index patient when implementing this preventive therapy
in contacts, especially outside the patient's family.'. I would like to propose to
change that into: 'revealing the identity of the index patient when implementing
this preventive therapy for contacts should be handled with care and only after
gaining consent, especially when this takes place outside the patient's family'.</p>
              <p>- In sentence 397, the English could be improved by removing 'between the sum of
them'."</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript has improved a lot and is, in my opionion, almost ready
to be published. Some relatively minor final comments:</p>
              <p>- Please check punctuation marks and paces use througout the manuscript. Examples:
remove comma in sentence 51; parenthesis in sentence 143 should be placed after
'referrals' instead of 'rehabilitation'; remove full stop in sentence 317; remove
space in sentence 325 &amp; 397.</p>
              <p>- In table 'Table 1 - Disability grade and his characteristics', the word 'claw' at
hands &amp; feet at G2D can be seen as stigmatizing language. Better is
'contractures' or 'claw hand deformity'</p>
              <p>- The reference for 'WHO disability grading for leprosy' (part of Table 1) is:
<ext-link xlink:href="https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/42060" ext-link-type="uri">https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/42060</ext-link></p>
              <p>- The level of English could be improved at sentence 291-2: 'care should be taken to
reveal the identity of the index patient when implementing this preventive therapy
in contacts, especially outside the patient's family.'. I would like to propose to
change that into: 'revealing the identity of the index patient when implementing
this preventive therapy for contacts should be handeled with care and only after
gaining consent, especially when this takes place outside the patient's family'.</p>
              <p>- In sentence 397, the English could be improved by removing 'between the sum of
them'.</p>

              <p>Dear Mr Martoreli Júnior,</p>
              <p>We are delighted to inform you that your manuscript, "Inequality of gender, age and
disabilities due to leprosy and trends in a hyperendemic metropolis: Evidence from
an eleven-year time series study in Central-West Brazil," has been formally accepted
for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
              <p>We have now passed your article onto the PLOS Production Department who will complete
the rest of the publication process. All authors will receive a confirmation email
upon publication.</p>
              <p>The corresponding author will soon be receiving a typeset proof for review, to ensure
errors have not been introduced during production. Please review the PDF proof of
your manuscript carefully, as this is the last chance to correct any scientific or
type-setting errors. Please note that major changes, or those which affect the
scientific understanding of the work, will likely cause delays to the publication
date of your manuscript. Note: Proofs for Front Matter articles (Editorial,
Viewpoint, Symposium, Review, etc...) are generated on a different schedule and may
not be made available as quickly.</p>
              <p>Soon after your final files are uploaded, the early version of your manuscript will
be published online unless you opted out of this process. The date of the early
version will be your article's publication date. The final article will be published
to the same URL, and all versions of the paper will be accessible to readers.</p>
              <p>Thank you again for supporting open-access publishing; we are looking forward to
publishing your work in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. </p>
              <p>Best regards,</p>
