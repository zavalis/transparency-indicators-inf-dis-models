                <p id="Par1">The current study aims to provide a fine-scale spatiotemporal estimate of malaria incidence among Cameroonian under-5, and to determine its associated environmental factors, to set up preventive interventions that are adapted to each health district of Cameroon. Routine data on symptomatic malaria in children under-5 collected in health facilities, between 2012 and 2018 were used. The trend of malaria cases was assessed by the Mann–Kendall (M–K) test. A time series decomposition was applied to malaria incidence to extract the seasonal component. Malaria risk was estimated by the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) and smoothed by a hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal model. In total, 4,052,216 cases of malaria were diagnosed between 2012 and 2018. There was a gradual increase per year, from 369,178 in 2012 to 652,661 in 2018. After adjusting the data for completeness, the national incidence ranged from 489‰ in 2012 to 603‰ in 2018, with an upward trend (M–K test p-value &lt; 0.001). At the regional level, an upward trend was observed in Adamaoua, Centre without Yaoundé, East, and South regions. There was a positive spatial autocorrelation of the number of malaria incident-cases per district per year as suggested by the Moran’s I test (statistic range between 0.11 and 0.53). The crude SIR showed a heterogeneous malaria risk with values ranging from 0.00 to 8.90, meaning that some health districts have a risk 8.9 times higher than the national annual level. The incidence and risk of malaria among under-5 in Cameroon are heterogeneous and vary significantly across health districts and seasons. It is crucial to adapt malaria prevention measures to the specificities of each health district, in order to reduce its burden in health districts where the trend is upward.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Significant efforts have been dedicated to the fight against malaria worldwide over the last two decades. These efforts have contributed to a reduction in the incidence, and mortality related to malaria since 2010<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Indeed, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that the incidence of malaria has decreased worldwide from 71 to 57 per thousand population at risk between 2010 and 2018, with South-East Asia registering a 70% reduction, compared to a 22% reduction in sub-Saharan Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Although all age groups are susceptible to malaria, the disease disproportionately affects children under five years (under-5) whose immune system is less developed, and can result in many complications such as anaemia, acute kidney injury, or death; in 2018, 67% of malaria-related deaths were in the under-5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">To stay on track with the progress made between 2000 and 2010, Cameroon has made the fight against malaria a public health priority, particularly among children under-5 and pregnant women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Hence, since 2010, the country has significantly increased the number of interventions to reduce the burden of malaria. These include free intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnant women, free treatment of malaria in children under-5, distribution of mosquito bed nets throughout the country, training of community health workers to diagnose and treat malaria, and digitisation of the national malaria data collection system. The latter has provided accurate data to estimate the incidence of malaria in different areas of the country and to see the specificities of each region in terms of malaria burden.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Recent advances in spatiotemporal epidemiology have made it possible to provide an area-specific estimate that can guide policy-makers in tailoring interventions according to the specificity of each geographical unit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This initiative, led by the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) team, has drawn attention on the need for fine-scale disaggregated estimates to significantly reduce the global malaria burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">In Cameroon, given the variation in vegetation and climatic conditions in each region of the country, the biotope of the malaria vector (<italic>Anopheles</italic>) varies greatly by region and by the period of the year (rainy or dry season)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>; suggesting also a need for a fine-scale temporal analysis for decision-making rather than aggregated country-level data that shadows the epidemiological specificity of each area.</p>
              <p id="Par6">This study aimed at providing a fine-scale analysis of symptomatic malaria incidence in under-5, and at assessing the time trend and seasonality of malaria between 2012 and 2018, and their association with environmental factors.</p>

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p id="Par7">Cameroon is located in Central Africa (2–13° N) and characterized by three different climatic zones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The equatorial zone (2–9° N) is marked by an average annual temperature of about 25 °C and the presence of rainfall throughout the year, favouring the year-round growth of female Anopheles, the malaria vectors. The Sudanian zone, lying between 7–10° N, is typified by less abundant rainfall with a dry season lasting 5–6 months and an average annual temperature of about 22 °C. The Sudano-Sahelian zone, lying between 10–13° N, is the driest and is characterised by a shorter annual rainy season of about 2–3 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par8">Between 2012 and 2018, Cameroon's population grew from 20.52 million to 23.80 million, with 44.6% of the population aged less than 15 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The country is administratively divided into 10 regions (North-West, Adamaoua, East, South, Far North, Centre, Littoral, North, West and South-West). For consistency in our analysis, the two largest cities in the country, Douala (located in the Littoral region) and Yaoundé (in the Centre region), have been considered as two separate regions, giving a total number of 12 regions in our analysis. The regions located in the equatorial zone are South, Centre, Littoral, East, and South-West, while those in the Sudanian zone are West and North-West. The Sudano-Sahelian zone contains the regions of Adamaoua, North and Far North. The entomological inoculation rate of malaria varies by region and is about 6.0–20.0 ib/p/m in the Far North, 24.5–60.0 ib/p/m in the North, 100 ib/p/yr in Adamaoua, 2.2–11.0 ib/p/yr in West and North-West, 0.7–1.4 ib/p/m in South, Centre, Littoral, East, and South-West, and 0–90.0 ib/p/yr in Douala and Yaoundé<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par9">The Cameroonian health system has a pyramidal structure with the operational level (health district) at its base. The division into health districts does not overlap the boundaries of the regions. In 2018, the country had 189 health districts (see Supplemental Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> online).</p>

                <title>Data source</title>
                <p id="Par10">The data on malaria in children used in this study are those compiled by the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP). Cameroon has an electronic malaria data collection system (DHIS-2). Data from all public and private health facilities in the country are entered monthly into a single electronic database. This allows a pooling at the level of health areas, health districts, or regions. The health-seeking behaviour was obtained from the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) programme and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS). The environmental data, i.e., temperature, rainfall, and vegetation from 2012 to 2018 were retrieved from official sources presented in the appendix (see Supplemental Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> online).</p>

                <p id="Par11">As these data are collected by health facilities, a confirmed case of malaria was defined as the presence in a symptomatic patient (fever, headache or other malaria-related symptoms) of a positive malaria test (either a rapid diagnostic test or a blood smear)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. To estimate the incident cases number in each health district, the raw number of reported cases was adjusted according to the method described by Cibulskis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> to provide a more accurate estimate of incident cases as follow:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

All data except p and n (which were retrieved from DHS and MICS) were obtained from the NMCP. This adjustment is made because in sub-Saharan African countries, not all malaria cases occurring in the communities are taken to hospitals for treatment. Indeed, some cases will resort to traditional medicine, or go directly to the pharmacy to obtain a medicine or seek advice from health personnel without going to the health facilities.

                <p id="Par29">Between 2012 and 2018, 4,052,216 cases of malaria were diagnosed in under-5 in Cameroon, either by blood smear or RDT. With a progressive increase per year from 369,178 in 2012 to 652,661 in 2018. The equatorial zone recorded the highest number of incident cases (2,134,187 cases), followed by the Sudano-Sahelian zone (1,403,994 cases) and the Sudanian zone (514,036 cases). After adjusting the raw data for completeness, and computing the incidence rate, there was an upward trend in incidence of malaria at the national level (p-value M–K: &lt; 0.001). However, four of the twelve regions, namely East (M–K p-value: 0.04), South (M–K p-value: 0.07), Centre without Yaoundé (M–K p-value: 0.02), Adamaoua (M–K p-value: 0.007), showed an upward trend, while the South-West (M–K p-value: 0.37), West (M–K p-value: 0.76), Douala-Littoral (M–K p-value: 0.76), Far North (M–K p-value: 0.22), North-West (M–K p-value: 0.13), Littoral [without Douala] (M–K p-value: 0.13), Yaoundé-Centre (M–K p-value: 0.37) had no monotonic trend, and North (M–K p-value: 0.04) a downward trend (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplemental Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> online). When looking at the incidence in the different climatic zones, only the equatorial zone showed a significant upward trend (p-value M–K &lt; 0.001), while the Sudano-Sahelian zone and the Sudanian zone did not exhibit any monotonic trend.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Malaria incidence rate in under-fives by region between 2012–2018.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par36">The current analysis of reported cases of symptomatic malaria among children under-5 routinely collected by the country's health facilities in Cameroon shows that 4,052,216 cases of malaria have been diagnosed in this age group between 2012 and 2018, with an upward trend in the incidence rate over time at the national level. In addition, the results suggest a substantial variation in the malaria trend, seasonality across health districts and a different pattern of malaria risk across years. Furthermore, a strong positive correlation of the malaria incidence rate with temperature and rainfall was found.</p>
              <p id="Par37">Despite intensified efforts to reduce the burden of malaria in the under-5 in Cameroon, we found an upward trend in malaria incidence at the national level during the study period, as confirmed by the Mann–Kendall trend test. This is probably multi-factorial and related to the gradual improvement in both the country's malaria diagnostic capacity and the efficiency of the health reporting system, but also to the underuse of preventive measures.</p>
              <p id="Par38">Indeed, during the study period, the availability and accessibility of rapid diagnostic testing for malaria increased considerably<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. With more community health workers who were trained to diagnose and treat malaria, the number of reported cases increased between 2016 and 2018. The reason being that cases that were previously undiagnosed because they lived in remote areas with poor access to health facilities, were now diagnosed, treated free of charge and reported in the national reporting system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Moreover, in Cameroon only 3–5% of the population is covered by health insurance, and due to lack of resources, parents are less likely to take their children to hospital<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Since the beginning of the current decade, treatment of malaria has been made free for under-5 by the government, gradually increasing the number of under-5 consultations and hence the number of diagnosed malaria cases. Furthermore, the reporting system has been progressively improved, with the completeness rate of reports ranging from 79 to 87% between 2014 and 2018, resulting in an increase in the number of reported cases of malaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par40">In addition, the ineffective use of preventive methods such as mosquito bed nets may also be a plausible explanation, as previously reported in other sub-Saharan African countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Even though ownership has increased significantly (2% in 2004, 36% in 2011 and 73% in 2018), mosquito bed net usage is less effective in the country. According to the results of the 2018 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), only 60% of the under-5 slept under a mosquito bed net the day before the survey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The reasons for low mosquito bed net use reported in most surveys conducted in Cameroon are: heat-related discomfort, lack of access to bed nets and the perception of a low Anopheles density by the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par41">Our findings suggest heterogeneity within a region in terms of malaria incidence. This has already been reported in previous studies in Cameroon, and was hypothesised to be related to the variability, within the same region, of environmental factors influencing mosquito proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that the proliferation of female Anopheles is high during the rainy seasons because of the optimal temperature for their growth (16–34 °C) and the presence of breathing areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. As the climate and vegetation vary greatly across regions of the country and the period of the year, the reproductive conditions for mosquitos are variable in time and space, and so does the incidence. Similarly, seasonality and malaria risk are very heterogeneous in time and space, probably for similar reasons, as in several sub-Saharan African countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par42">Results of the current study call for area-specific malaria prevention measures for under-5 in Cameroon, considering the season of the year and environmental conditions. More attention in preventive and therapeutic interventions should be given to the equatorial zone, especially to the East region which has most of the health districts at high risk of malaria. They also call for intensified efforts to reduce the burden of malaria in under-5 in Cameroon, to curb the trend of this life-threatening disease and to reach the country goal of malaria burden reduction.</p>
              <p id="Par43">Although the conclusions of this study are based on rigorous statistical analysis, the results must be interpreted in the context of some drawbacks. The population at risk was derived from the estimate made by the national institute of statistics based on the 2005 census and may be slightly different from the real population living in the different areas. Moreover, covariates that measure malaria interventions were not introduced into the Bayesian model, because of difficulties to synthetized them given the data in hand. Hence a variance in risk that may be due to those interventions was not captured. Furthermore, available data did not allow for a distinction between the proportion of cases diagnosed by microscopy or RDT, thus precluding any adjustment for differences in diagnostic technique. A more complete picture of both morbidity and mortality associated with malaria during the study period would have been provided by the inclusion of spatio-temporal analysis of mortality data. Nevertheless, this study is the first conducted on a time-series of routinely collected malaria data in under-5 living in Cameroon, adjusted according to the WHO recommendations. It is also the first to assess the seasonal variation of malaria incidence based on a robust and updated method of time series decomposition and to produce, using a Bayesian model, a map of malaria risk in under-5 in Cameroon.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par44">The analysis of the incidence of symptomatic malaria in children under-5 between 2012 and 2018 in Cameroon shows an overall upward trend at the national level, a substantial variation in the malaria trend, seasonality, and a variable pattern of malaria risk from one year to another, suggesting that the incidence of malaria in children under-5 in Cameroon is heterogeneous and varies between health districts and seasons of the year. It is therefore crucial to adapt malaria preventive measures to the specificities of each health district, considering seasonal variations in the incidence of this disease.</p>
