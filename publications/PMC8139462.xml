              <abstract>
                <p>Against the current COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide have devised a variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate it. However, it is generally difficult to estimate the joint impact of different control strategies. In this paper, we tackle this question with an extended epidemic SEIR model, informed by a socio-political classification of different interventions. First, we inquire the conceptual effect of mitigation parameters on the infection curve. Then, we illustrate the potential of our model to reproduce and explain empirical data from a number of countries, to perform cross-country comparisons. This gives information on the best synergies of interventions to control epidemic outbreaks while minimising impact on socio-economic needs. For instance, our results suggest that, while rapid and strong lockdown is an effective pandemic mitigation measure, a combination of social distancing and early contact tracing can achieve similar mitigation synergistically, while keeping lower isolation rates. This quantitative understanding can support the establishment of mid- and long-term interventions, to prepare containment strategies against further outbreaks. This paper also provides an online tool that allows researchers and decision makers to interactively simulate diverse scenarios with our model.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The current global COVID-19 epidemic has led to significant impairments of public life world-wide. To mitigate the spread of the virus and to prevent dramatic situations in the healthcare systems, many countries have implemented a combination of rigorous measures like lockdown, isolation of symptomatic cases and the tracing, testing, and quarantine of their contacts. In order to obtain information about the efficacy of such measures, a quantitative understanding of their impact is necessary. This can be based on statistical methods [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and on epidemiological models [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Epidemiological modeling in particular can provide detailed mechanisms for the epidemic dynamics and allow investigating how epidemics will develop under different assumptions.</p>
              <p>Preliminary efforts have been made to quantify the contribution of different policy interventions [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but these rely on complex models based on a number of assumptions. Instead, we base our study on a classical SEIR-like epidemiological model. SEIR models are minimal mechanistic models that consider individuals transitioning through Susceptible → Exposed → Infectious → Removed state during the epidemics [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The essential control parameter is the basic reproduction number <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], that worldwide non-pharmaceutical mitigation strategies aim at reducing below the threshold value 1. Several literature studies consider the effect of single interventions in SEIR-like models [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We aim at considering the added value of early interventions, namely those that target Susceptible and Exposed people, and the effect of different combinations of control strategies on the infection curve. To do so, we incorporate additional compartments reflecting different categories of control strategies, identified by socio-political studies [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In particular, the model focuses on four main mitigation programs: social distancing (lowering the rate of social contacts), active protection (decreasing the number of susceptible people), active removal of latent asymptomatic carriers [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and active removal of infectious carriers. This study investigates how these programs achieve mitigation both individually and combined, first conceptually and then by cross-country comparison. By our modelling choice, we consider how and how much preventive interventions can supplement the quarantining of contagious individuals. We ultimately show that analogous containment levels of the infectious curve can be achieved by alternative synergies of non-pharmaceutical interventions. This information can supply Government decisions, helping to avoid overloading the healthcare system and to minimise stressing the economic system (due to prolonged lockdown). We expect our model, together with its interactive online tool, to contribute to crucial tasks of decision making and to prepare containment strategies against further outbreaks.</p>

              <title>Materials and methods</title>
              <p>This study links policy measures to epidemiological modelling, focusing on how the dynamics of the infectious curve is controlled by several interventions. Initially, we perform a conceptual analysis, like in other works [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252019.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Then, we investigate how well the considered control synergies reproduce and explain the evolution of empirical data from the first COVID-19 wave in six different countries. By doing so, we hope to contribute to discussions about the relevance of such conceptual strategies in real-world conditions. In this section, we illustrate the modelling choices and the use of data.</p>
              <sec id="sec003">
                <title>The classical SEIR model</title>
                <p>SEIR models are continuous-time, mass conservative compartment-based models of infectious diseases [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252019.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. They assume a homogeneously mixing population (or fully connected graphs) and focus on the evolution of mean properties of the closed system. All of these models are classical and widely used tools to investigate the principal mechanisms governing the spread of infections and their dynamics. There is a broad range of such models, from more conceptual to more realistic versions, e.g. SEIR with delay [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], spatial coupling [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252019.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], extended compartments [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], or those that consider progression of treatments and age distribution [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
                <p>Main compartments of SEIR models (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g001">Fig 1</xref>, framed) are: susceptible S (the pool of individuals socially active and at risk of infection), exposed E (corresponding to latent carriers of the infection), infectious I (individuals having developed the disease and being contagious) and removed R (those that have processed the disease, being either recovered or dead). The model’s default parameters are the average contact rate <italic>β</italic>, the inverse of mean incubation period <italic>α</italic> and the inverse of mean contagious period <italic>γ</italic>. When focusing on infection dynamics rather than patients’ fate, the latter combines recovery and death rate [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. From these parameters, epidemiologists calculate the “basic reproduction number” <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> = <italic>β</italic>/<italic>γ</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] at the epidemic beginning. During the epidemic progression, isolation after diagnosis, vaccination campaigns and active mitigation measures are in action. Hence, we speak of “effective reproduction number” <inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e001"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e001.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e001g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

                <title>Data and analyzed countries</title>
                <p>When investigating the ability of our conceptual model to explain mitigation, we compared it with empirical data. To do this, we considered the main non-pharmaceutical interventions applied by several countries, by integrating multi-disciplinary information. In fact, governments worldwide have issued a number of social measures, including those for public health safeguard, economic support, movement restriction and non-pharmaceutical interventions to hamper disease spreading. Scholars from political sciences and sociology have recorded and classified such measures [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252019.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Among the resources listed on the World Health Organization “Tracking Public Health and Policy Measures” [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], we used information from the ACAPS database [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] that contains a curated categorization of policy measures. ACAPS is an independent, non-profit information provider helping humanitarian actors to respond more effectively to disasters. The ACAPS analysis team has aggregated and classified interventions from different sources (media, governments and international organizations), for all countries and in time. Mitigation measures against the epidemic are classified under “Movement restrictions”, “Lockdown”, “Social Distancing” and “Monitoring and Surveillance”. Our modelling choice is based on these categories, which are reflected by additional compartments to the classical SEIR model (see next section).</p>
                <p>Epidemiological data for all selected countries and regions were obtained from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The data are from 22 Jan 2020 to 08 July 2020. Lombardy data were obtained from the Protezione Civile Italiana data repository “Dati COVID-19 Italia” [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], from 22 Feb 2020 to 08 July 2020. We acknowledge that the quality of data of early detection of COVID-19 cases is often associated with limited testing capabilities, which could bias subsequent analysis. However, across the analysed countries, the share of positive tests was similar (see e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]), and no significant deviation from expected dynamics was observed by studies applying Benford’s law [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252019.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], possibly indicating that these data still capture to a reasonable extent the dynamics of the epidemic wave. In addition, the analysed countries were selected based on the fact that they sufficiently met the other model assumptions, e.g. low spatial heterogeneity and large amount of cases to fulfill the mean field assumption.</p>
                <p>This study analyses the effect of mitigation measures in flattening the curve. Despite having a precise starting date, such measures take some days to be fully effective. We estimate an average delay using the Google Mobility Reports [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252019.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] for the selected countries. Google provides changes in mobility with respect to a monthly baseline, w.r.t. 6 locations: Retail &amp; Recreation, Grocery &amp; Pharmacy, Transit stations, Workplaces, Residential, Parks. We average the decrease in mobility at the first four locations (corresponding to those where social mixing happens more frequently [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]) to get a proxy of the time needed for hard lockdown to be fully effective (cf. Fig 4c).</p>

                <title>The extended SPQEIR model to reflect suppression strategies</title>
                <p>SEIR models reproduce the typical bell-shaped epidemic curves for the number of infected people. The dynamics of this curve is of high importance for practical policy making. Not only it relates to the main stressors for the health system [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252019.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252019.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but it also has an impact on the economic system [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], e.g. because it takes some time (<inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e002"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e002.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e002g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mstyle mathvariant="double-struck"><mml:mtext>T</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>) to mitigate the curve, until the number of new infections is below an accepted threshold. Commonly, mitigation measures against epidemics aim at flattening the curve of new infections [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the classical SEIR model is not granular enough to investigate mitigation measures when they need to be considered or should be sequentially reduced if already in place. Therefore, we extend the classical SEIR model as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g001">Fig 1</xref> (red insertions) into the SPQEIR model, to reflect the intervention categories described above. We particularly focus on the control of Susceptible and Exposed people, given by preventive isolation, contact tracing or social distancing measures, but we also include the control of infectious people by isolation. The model can be summarized as follows:</p>
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>The classical blocks S, E, I, R are maintained;</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>A social distancing parameter <italic>ρ</italic> is included to tune the contact rate <italic>β</italic>;</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Two new compartments are introduced where:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Protected P includes individuals that are removed from the susceptible pool and are thus protected from the virus. This can happen through full isolation as in China in early 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] or by different vaccination strategies which reduce the susceptible pool;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Quarantined Q describes latent carriers that are identified and quarantined after monitoring and tracing of contacts.</p></list-item></list></p>
                  </list-item>
                </list>
                <p>We do not explicitly introduce a second quarantined state for isolation of confirmed cases after the Infectious state [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252019.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] but consider this together with the Removed state, by tuning the removal rate with an extra parameter (see [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and references therein). Quarantining infected symptomatic patients is a necessary first step in every epidemic [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. An additional link from Q to R, even though realistic, is neglected as both compartments are already outside the “contagion system” and would therefore be redundant from the perspective of evolution of the infection. In general, protected individuals can get back to the pool of susceptible after a while, but here we neglect this transition, to focus on simulating mitigation programs alone at their early stage. Long-term predictions could be modelled even more realistically by considering such link, that would lead to an additional parameter to be estimated and is beyond the scope of the present paper.</p>
                <p>The model has in total 7 parameters. Three of them (<italic>β</italic>, <italic>α</italic>, <italic>γ</italic> introduced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g001">Fig 1</xref>) are based on the classical SEIR model. The new parameters <italic>ρ</italic>, <italic>μ</italic>, <italic>χ</italic>, <italic>η</italic> account for alternative mitigation programs to control the infectious curve (see Table 2 for details). Commonly, social distancing is modelled by the parameter <italic>ρ</italic>. In a closed-system setting where all individuals belong to the susceptible pool, but interact less intensively with each other, <italic>ρ</italic> tunes the contact rate parameter <italic>β</italic>, resulting in the effective reproduction number <inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e003"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e003.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e003g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M3"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>. The parameter <italic>μ</italic> stably decreases the susceptible population by introducing an active protection rate. This accounts for improvements of public health, e.g. stricter lockdown of communities, or reduction of the pool of susceptible people after reduced commuters’ activity, or vaccination. The parameter <italic>χ</italic> introduces an active removal rate of latent carriers. Intensive early contact tracing and improved methods to detect asymptomatic latent carriers may enhance the removal of exposed subjects from the infectious network. Following earlier works [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252019.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and adjusting the current parameters, <inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e004"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e004.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e004g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M4"><mml:mover><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> can be then expressed as <inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e005"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e005.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e005g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M5"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>.

This would correspond to identifying infectious individuals before they recover or die, and prevent them from infecting other susceptibles.

                <title>Model fitting</title>
                <p>To show how our conceptual analysis is able to reproduce and explain empirical data, we fit the model to the official number of currently infected (active) cases of the first epidemic wave (winter-spring 2020), for each considered country. The choice is corroborated by the fact that all considered countries applied rapid, population-wide measures [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Model fitting to the infectious curves is performed in two steps, using the parameters known to be active (cf. <xref rid="pone.0252019.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). First, we estimate the “model consistent” date of first infection, so that the simulated curve matches the reported data of active infections. This initial step corresponds to setting the time initial conditions of the SEIR model [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The fitting is performed with default parameter values, on a subset of data corresponding to the first outbreak, from first case until when measures are implemented (cf. <xref rid="pone.0252019.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We use a grid search method for least squares, sufficient to fit a single parameter:

              <p>First, we focus on the conceptual analysis of the effect of preventive mitigation interventions, initially for single measures (social distancing, active protection and active quarantining) and subsequently for a number of synergistic approaches. Additionally, we compare them to the effect of isolating contagious individuals. In particular, we study how crucial quantities, namely <inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e015"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e015.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e015g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M15"><mml:mover><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, the infectious peak height and time to zero infectious <inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e016"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e016.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e016g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M16"><mml:mstyle mathvariant="double-struck"><mml:mtext>T</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, depend on mitigation parameters.

                  <p>The parameter <italic>ρ</italic> captures social distancing effects, taking values in the interval [0, 1], where 0 indicates no contacts among individuals while 1 is equivalent to no action taken. To perform the current simulations, we assume a delay <italic>τ</italic> in implementing the measures of 10 days. Such value does not modify the qualitative behavior of the epidemic dynamics but influences the quantitative estimations of peak height and mitigation timing. We refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0252019.s002">S1 Text</xref> for further discussion. Overall, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g002">Fig 2</xref> reports simulation results about the effects of <italic>ρ</italic>. The curve of infectious is progressively flattened by social distancing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g002">Fig 2a</xref>) and its peak mitigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g002">Fig 2b</xref>). However, the time to mitigation gets delayed for decreasing <italic>ρ</italic>, until a threshold yielding a disease-free equilibrium rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g002">Fig 2c</xref>). In this case, the critical value for <italic>ρ</italic> is 0.4, leading to <inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e018"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e018.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e018g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M18"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g002">Fig 2c</xref> reveals that the dependence of <inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e019"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e019.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e019g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M19"><mml:mstyle mathvariant="double-struck"><mml:mtext>T</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> on <italic>ρ</italic> is not monotonous.

                  <p>As discussed above and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0252019.s002">S1 Text</xref>, our simulations take into account 10 days delay from the first infection to the initiation of active protection. Small values can reflect continuous improvement of protection measures (as people learnt better how to deal with the virus) or different vaccination strategies (thus going beyond non-pharmaceutical strategies). Higher values are considered to model certain effects of a step-wise hard lockdown (see following paragraph). The results are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g003">Fig 3</xref>. We see that small precautions can make an initial difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g003">Fig 3a and 3b</xref>). The time to zero infectious is decreased with higher values of active protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g003">Fig 3a and 3b</xref>). In particular, <italic>μ</italic> = 0.01<italic>d</italic><sup>−1</sup> mitigates the epidemics in about 6 months by protecting 70% of the population. Higher values of <italic>μ</italic> achieve mitigation faster, while protecting almost 100% of the population.

                  <p>Controlling latent carriers before symptom onset is an important strategy to limit transmission. We here consider how mitigation is achieved by targeted interventions, e.g. by contact tracing, and we quantify the interplay between precision and delay in tracing, thus expanding [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

                  <p>The simulations in this part are based on realistic assumptions: testing a person is effective only after a few days that that person has been exposed (to have a viral charge that is detectable). This induces a maximal quarantining rate <italic>θ</italic>, which we set <italic>θ</italic> = 0.33<italic>d</italic><sup>−1</sup> as testing is often considered effective after about three days from contagion [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, we get the active quarantining rate <italic>χ</italic> = <italic>χ</italic>′ ⋅ <italic>θ</italic>, where <italic>χ</italic>′ is a tuning parameter associated e.g. to contact tracing. As <italic>θ</italic> is fixed, we focus our analysis on <italic>χ</italic>′.

                  <p>Isolating contagious individuals is a first step to contrast the pandemic, on top of preventive measures. In this section, we consider its effect alone, to be compared with that of other single parameters shown above. As discussed above, we here consider simulations that include a delay of 10 days from the first infection to the initiation of the measures. Quantitative changes associated with different <italic>τ</italic> are discussed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0252019.s002">S1 Text</xref>. The results are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g007">Fig 7</xref>. Targeting the infectious population means that fewer people can spread the contagion. The curve of infections is progressively flattened, the more rapidly contagious people are identified and isolated, until a threshold value <italic>η</italic> = 0.51 (for our initial parameters). In turn, the mitigation time gets longer if <italic>η</italic> is increased, but has not yet crossed the threshold value. These findings point to the importance of complementing the control of contagious individuals with additional preventive measures such as the ones presented above. We acknowledge that these results are valid on average, but that breaking the infectious chain at specific links can have additional benefits in heterogeneous social networks.</p>

                <p>Fully enhanced active quarantining and active protection might not be always feasible, e.g. because of limited resources, technological limitations or welfare restrictions. On the other hand, the isolation of a limited portion of contagious individuals could not be sufficient. Therefore a synergistic approach is very attractive as it can flatten the curve with combinations of interventions that target different population groups and require distinct resources. This section shows a number of possible synergies, concentrating as before on abstract scenarios to investigate how combining different mitigation programs impact the control parameter <inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e028"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e028.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e028g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M28"><mml:mover><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0252019.e009">Eq (1)</xref>, the infection curves and the mitigation timing.</p>

Parameters are set without being specific to real measures taken: their value is so far conceptual and meaningful when compared across scenarios. Just like above, we consider a 10 days delay from the first infection to issuing measures; as suggested in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], delaying action could worsen the situation.

We do not claim this to be the true date of first infection in a country; it is the starting date of infections in case of homogeneous transmission, under the assumption of no superspreading events [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and with the hypothesis of coherent <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> (cf. <xref rid="pone.0252019.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). During the second fitting step, we also estimate the date at which mitigation measures start having effect on the infectious curve, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>. Comparing <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> with official intervention dates from <xref rid="pone.0252019.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, we notice that about 8 days are necessary to register lockdown effects.

The active parameters for the fit are reported in the same table. For the protection parameter, we used <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>ld</italic></sub> acting on 4 days (as introduced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g004">Fig 4</xref>) since it better reflects the rapid protection of certain individuals that happened during the first COVID-19 wave. Since <italic>S</italic> ∼ <italic>N</italic>, its quantitative impact is anyway greater on the <italic>S</italic> compartment. Other compartments are impacted by the remaining parameters. The results of the model fitting are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g009">Fig 9</xref>. The SPQEIR model, with appropriate parameters for each country (cf. <xref rid="pone.0252019.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), is fitted to reported infection curves and, overall, model fitting have good agreement with data. This supports the model structure as very simple yet realistic enough to capture the main dynamical behaviour of the infection curves in multiple countries. In addition, it allows for each country to obtain multiple sets of parameters representing different strategies. We notice that the effect of social distancing (<italic>ρ</italic>) is predominant as it homogeneously prevents the big pool of Susceptible individuals to stream into the Exposed compartment. However, also tracing and isolation can have a considerable effect in complementing population-wide interventions. The values associated to the fitted parameters correspond to non-negligible numbers of individuals affected by the interventions. Such values are discussed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0252019.s002">S1 Text</xref>. This is informative about how synergistic approaches can realistically explain the mitigation of the infectious curve, and highlight the potential advantages associated with modifying the combination of strategies in subsequent epidemic waves. Finally, it allows a comparison between different countries through the corresponding best fit parameters. For Ireland, although initial social distancing advises were issued on 13th March (cf. <xref rid="pone.0252019.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), fitting the complete curve was only possible when considering the lockdown date (28th March) as the major driver of the mitigation.</p>

From the data, we can observe a resurgence of cases that points to possible “second outbreaks” (particularly in Israel).</p>

                  <p>Model fitting is slightly hindered by data quality. For instance, Ireland reported intermittent data, while Lombardy is not perfectly represented, probably because of some data reporting issues and larger heterogeneity in its spacial patterns.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the reduced <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> metric (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0252019.e013">Eq 3</xref>) reports that the complete SPQEIR model and the simple social distancing one attain similar goodness of fit, although values for the SPQEIR are slightly lower in all cases. Country-specific extra parameters (<italic>cf.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0252019.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) are thus useful to fine-tune the reproduction of epidemic curves, as noticed in the conceptual analysis, Sec. “Synergistic scenarios”. This shows that synergistic measures are able to provide a similar mitigation of the curve of infections, and an analogous <inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e044"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e044.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e044g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M44"><mml:mover><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, as the pure social distancing scenario. In turn, synergistic approaches allow lower social distancing values, possibly having less severe social and psychological impacts on the population. This in turn supports the use of several interventions to control the epidemic curve in an effective and timely manner, while balancing social benefits. In addition, the SPQEIR is confirmed to be informative, on top of being fully interpretable and linked to recognised social policy categories.</p>

                  <p>Fitting a number of countries with the same model containing the same epidemiological parameters allows to perform a comparison on the efficacy of their interventions, to inform future decision making. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g009">Fig 9</xref>, parameter values providing the best fit of model to data are reported, together with the simulation results (mean values) calculated by the <italic>lmfit</italic> algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Different synergies yield similar values for <inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e047"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e047.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e047g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M47"><mml:mover><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, but the curve is different in its evolution as already observed in the previous sections. As expected from the model analysis above, the lower <inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e048"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e048.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e048g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M48"><mml:mover><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> is (below 1), the faster the mitigation of the epidemic. In addition, different parameter combinations generate curves that differ in amplitude and time evolution. This might well explain differences in reported total cases and deaths between various countries. Comparing Austria, Denmark and Lombardy, we observe that contact tracing and monitoring contribute to speeding up the curve decay, despite the fact that population-wide interventions played so far a major role. In general, combined isolation and tracing strategies would reduce transmission in addition to social distancing or self-isolation alone. In general, a strong, rapid lockdown that combines protection and social distancing seems the best option, as also suggested by the conceptual analysis. However, intervening with additional synergies is a viable option to mitigate the epidemic faster and with lower social values.</p>
                  <p>Finally, we observe the value of timely interventions: we see that intervening earlier with respect to the date of first infection helps reducing the daily curves by almost a factor of 10. For instance, we can compare Denmark and Lombardy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g009">Fig 9</xref>: the first one got a peak corresponding to about 0.08% of the whole population, while the second region registered a number of active cases of about 0.5% of the whole population. This translates in more than 3800 infectious on the Danish peak, and on more than 37000 on Lombardy’s.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The SPQEIR model assesses and compares the effectiveness of several control measures to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic curve. It integrates previous literature and considers synergy strategies often considered alone. In particular, we focus on preventive measures, i.e. those that target people that are not yet fully infectious. Initially, we perform conceptual simulations to investigate the effect of single and combined measures not only on <inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e049"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e049.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e049g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M49"><mml:mover><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, but also on the complete time evolution of the infectious curve. Then, we compare them with the isolation of contagious individuals. The possibility of choosing among several strategies is of practical importance for decision makers: a comparison of Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g007">7</xref> reveals that increasing social distancing delays and decrease the height of the peak of infections, increasing active protection as well decreases the height of the peak of infections, but anticipates the occurrence of such peak, increasing active quarantining also delays and decrease the height of the peak of infections like social distancing, but the same peak mitigation by active quarantining is associated with shorter delays than with social distancing.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the model is fitted to several countries, to estimate the plausible impact of synergistic strategies. The fit is performed until phase-out dates for the first epidemic wave (winter-spring 2020), when measures are progressively lifted and therefore the model assumptions do not hold anymore. We remark that the current set of parameters may not be unique, as there is high correlation among parameters. This is a common identifiability issue of SIR parameters, particularly when several of them contribute to the same control parameter <inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e050"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e050.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e050g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M50"><mml:mover><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. For instance, the <italic>lmfit</italic> diagnostic reports 0.9 correlation between <italic>ρ</italic> and <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>ld</italic></sub> and 0.99 between <italic>ρ</italic> and <italic>χ</italic>, for Austria. This means that they can equally well explain the evolution of the curve, so they could be alternatively chosen for epidemic control, while targeting different population groups. This is in line with our above analysis, as we aim at showing how different combinations of interventions can tune the mitigation of infection curves. We remark that, due to this degeneracy of parameters (<italic>i.e.</italic> several combination can yield to same <inline-formula id="pone.0252019.e051"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0252019.e051.jpg" id="pone.0252019.e051g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M51"><mml:mover><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>), the ones reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g009">Fig 9</xref> constitute a reasonable set obtained by an automatic least-square algorithm, but estimating their true values (inverse problem) needs to be complemented with alternative, targeted approaches.</p>
              <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g009">Fig 9</xref> we extrapolate the model, with same parameter values, after phase-out (dashed lines), to compare observed data to the most optimistic scenario, where measures would not have been lifted. We observe that, up to July 8th, the infection curves mostly maintained an inertial decreasing trend: despite some fluctuations that make them generally higher than the best scenario, they kept on following a downward trend similar to that of the model. We speculate that this phenomenon is linked to changed behaviors, face masks [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and improved sanitising practices that maintained social distancing values, as well as contact tracing practices issued by many countries along with the phase-out. However, some countries (Israel in particular, but also Austria) already showed a worrisome upward trend, eventually associated to a second outbreak [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As this is not a low probability event, we stress the usefulness of our analysis to prepare for future developments in pandemic progression.</p>
              <p>It has been asked whether the peak of infections was reached because of herd immunity or because of interventions [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. An added value of this study is to confirm that the peak of infection, for the considered countries, was not reached because of herd immunity. On the contrary, it is the effect of a number of mitigation measures that reduced the number of cases artificially. This should warn about the high numbers of people that are still susceptible.</p>
              <p>We acknowledge the limitations of our analysis. Due to its structure and the use of ordinary differential equations, the model only accounts for average trends. However, it cannot reproduce fluctuations in the data, being them intrinsic in the epidemic, or from testing and reporting protocols that might differ among countries. The model focuses on initialization of measures that last for short-medium periods, as it does not include out-fluxes from the “safeguarded” compartments P and Q. This assumption is not completely realistic and we are aware that household infections concurred to a significant number of contagions. Like other studies [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], our simulations thus underestimate the disease burden coming from this source. However, the synergy with other parameters can retain the modulation of the dynamics posed by different behaviors. Overall, our model is used to assess the validity of control measures rather than to predict the complete evolution of the epidemic. Similarly, in order to concentrate on the generic control of infectious curves, we did not include further compartments about hospitalization, as they are already upstream with respect to the I compartment, nor we considered asymptomatic patients, that would not impact the main findings about synergistic mitigation. In addition, the constant nature of parameters used in this analysis allows good agreement between model and data when countries implemented rapid and strong measures point-wise in time, with little follow-ups. Further studies, with time varying parameters, could obtain more precise values. In the same way, transferring models from country to country requires fulfilling the same assumptions on model structure and basic hypothesis. This is shown by the different fitting performances, that suggest that a transfer is not always possible. The same fitting performance is often impacted by the data quality, related to monitoring, testing and reporting; despite our carefulness in selecting countries that had similar positive rates, there could be additional uncertainties to the parameter values that we estimated. Finally, we remark that the retrospective dates in <xref rid="pone.0252019.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> should be interpreted under the model assumptions: they could suggest that the first infection happened several weeks before the official detection, but they could as well be associated to the inherent identifiability limits of SIR-like parameters [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252019.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p>
              <p>In general, this study is not intended to make a ranking of country responses, nor to suggest that different strategies could have led to better outcomes. Contrariwise, it should be used as a methodological step towards quantitatively inquiring the effect of different intervention categories and of their combinations. It examines possible abstract scenarios and compares quantitative, model-based outputs, but it is not intended to fully represent specific countries nor to reproduce the epidemic complexity within societies. In fact, the model does not provide fine-grained quantification of specific interventions, e.g. how effective masks are in protecting people, how much proximity tracing apps increase <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>find</italic></sub>, how changes in behavior are associated with epidemic decline [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and so on. We acknowledge that the new compartments cannot perfectly match policy measures, but are a reasonable approximation. Some real measures might also affect multiple parameters at once, e.g. safety devices and lockdown could impact both <italic>μ</italic> and <italic>ρ</italic>. Comparing results of this macro-scale model with those of complex, micro-scale ones [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] could inform researchers and policy makers about the epidemic dynamics and effective synergies to hamper it. Any conclusion should be carefully interpreted by experts, and the feasibility of tested scenarios should be discussed before reaching consensus.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>We have developed a minimal model to link intervention categories against epidemic spread to epidemiological model compartments. This allows quantitative assessment of non-pharmaceutical mitigation strategies on top of social distancing, for a number of countries. Strategies have different effects on epidemic evolution in terms of curve flattening and timing to mitigation. As with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252019.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], we have observed the need to enforce containment measures (i.e., detect and isolate cases, identify and quarantine contacts and at risk neighborhoods) along with mitigation (i.e., slow down viral spread in the community with social distancing).</p>
              <p>By extending the classic SEIR model into the SPQEIR model, we distinguished the impact of different control programs in flattening the peak and anticipating the mitigation of the epidemic. Depending on their strength and synergy, non-pharmaceutical interventions can hamper the disease from spreading in a population. First, we performed a complete sensitivity analysis of their effects, both alone and in synergy scenarios. Then, we moved from idealised representations to fitting realistic contexts, allowing preliminary mapping of intervention categories to abstract programs. We verified that the model is informative in interpolating the infection curves for a number of countries, and performed cross-country comparison. We could then obtain model-based outputs on the strength of interventions, for a number of countries that respected the model assumptions. This provides better, quantitative insights on the effect of mitigation measures and their timing, and allows improved comparison.</p>
              <p>Overall, this work could contribute to quantitative assessments of epidemic mitigation strategies. To tackle current epidemic waves, and against possible resurgence of contagion [<xref rid="pone.0252019.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] (also cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0252019.g009">Fig 9</xref>), better understanding the effect of different non-pharmaceutical interventions could help planning mid- and long-term measures and to prepare preventive plans while allowing a relaxation of social distancing measures. In fact, this synergistic approach still remains of high importance in this second lockdown times, where countries still need to balance different non-pharmaceutical interventions to keep the infection at bay while complementing vaccination strategies and containing the impacts on other aspects of society.</p>

              <p>Dynamical SPQEIR model assesses the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 epidemic outbreaks</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Proverbio,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>In particular, Referee #2 has raised a number of critical remarks regarding the model structure and the statistical analysis that require careful consideration.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The paper introduces in the SEIR model 3 different types of non-pharmaceutical interventions i.e. social distancing, quarantine of exposed individuals and generalized lock-down. After the outbreak of COVID pandemic several papers have been published in this direction e.g.</p>

              <p>Perkins et al. Bulletin of Mathematical Biology 82, 118 (2020);</p>
              <p>Lai et al. Nature volume 585, 410–413 (2020);</p>
              <p>Alrrashed et al Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 20, 100420 (2020)</p>
              <p>and also for the SIR model where quarantine is directly introduced on the infected nodes:</p>
              <p>Anand et al. Transactions of the Indian National Academy of Engineering 5, 141–148 (2020)</p>
              <p>Giordano et al. Nature Medicine 26, 855–860 (2020)</p>
              <p>Mancastroppa et al. Phys. Rev. E 102, 020301(R) (2020)</p>
              <p>Many other papers have been recently published or submitted.</p>
              <p>In these models often several aspects are taken into account which are overlooked in the present paper e.g. hospitalization, asymptomatic individuals, heterogeneous behavior of the individuals. The authors should explain what is the main advance with respect the vast recent literature.</p>
              <p>In this respect, the authors consider the simultaneous adoption of three different kinds of measures, however it is not clear in the paper what is the main advantages of introducing this modelization. In particular which are the different effects due to the three strategy of containment? E.g. when you consider the fit of datasets the use of a single strategy (i.e. social distancing) provides a very similar fit of the case where the synergy of the different strategies is considered; also the improvement in the X^2 is very small. So it is not clear what is the advantage of adopting the different strategies, in the description of non-pharmaceutical interventions. In summary the paper introduces a model with a description of three types of non-pharmaceutical interventions, this interventions have been already introduced in different papers even if with some differences. In this context, from a theoretical point of view the authors do not evidence any peculiar or interesting effect due to the presence of these three terms; while a comparison with datasets does not show any advantages in interpretations of the epidemic evolution in the different countries. In this perspective I think that the paper is not suitable for publication without a significant improvement.</p>
              <p>Another very important remark is about the model for a generalized lock-down. In your approach only susceptible nodes are isolated in the state P while I expect that a fraction of the whole population in a lock-down is isolated; in particular I expect that the sudden isolation of infected and exposed individuals should have a larger effect than the isolation of susceptible ones. Moreover I think that the process should be described only by the approach in figure 4 i.e. a sudden isolation of a large number of individuals which remain isolated during the whole period of non-pharmaceutical interventions; while other individuals do not self isolates (e.g. they do an essential job), so that after the quick self isolation mu is restored to 0. On the other hand, a self isolation with constant rate, in the whole period of intervention seems to be very unlikely. An even a similar and simpler model of a generalized lock down could be at the beginning of the intervention an instantaneous isolation in the state P of a fraction of individuals (independently of their states). Therefore, I think that the different scenarios and the data fitting should take into account only the approach in figure 4 (clearly with possible different fraction of people that self isolate).</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: REVIEWER COMMENTS TO AUTHORS</p>
              <p>Referee report: PONE-D-20-26921</p>
              <p>Evaluation</p>
              <p>The paper has a number of shortcomings, and would require a much deeper</p>
              <p>discussion of several parts (see my main points). Also, the</p>
              <p>epidemiological language should be improved in many points. Some cited</p>
              <p>papers are weak. Therefore, the authors should (i) do an effort to</p>
              <p>(substantially) amend their paper according to the indications reported</p>
              <p>below, but especially (ii) put into evidence their findings that are of</p>
              <p>main epidemiological interest, particularly in relation to the insights</p>
              <p>that the adopted modeling framework would provide in relation to the</p>
              <p>understanding of COVID-19 control.</p>
              <p>Main points</p>
              <p>The proposed SPQEIR model is quite restrictive in its formulation and</p>
              <p>therefore the underlying hypotheses should be carefully discussed.</p>
              <p>First, P individuals are – according to the stated hypotheses - fully</p>
              <p>protected, which corresponds to full segregation forever i.e., during</p>
              <p>the entire history of intervention measures. But measures aimed at</p>
              <p>confining susceptible people hardly can go beyond home confinement, and</p>
              <p>there is strong evidence that – during lockdowns - much COVID</p>
              <p>transmission occurred within households (especially during the first</p>
              <p>wave). Pairwise, also removed E individuals are fully inactivated in the</p>
              <p>SPEIR. Also, this should be discussed carefully. Moreover, as E</p>
              <p>individuals can be removed mostly by way of tracing, it is not clear to</p>
              <p>me why you do not allow a pairwise option for I individuals (e.g.</p>
              <p>asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic) by the same mechanism. Last, I</p>
              <p>understand screening and isolation of actively infected individuals is</p>
              <p>incorporated into removal (L99), which is an option. However, did you</p>
              <p>handle your removal rate to account for this (perhaps I didn’t note</p>
              <p>details)?</p>
              <p>L141 “We fit the model to the official number of currently infected</p>
              <p>(active) cases, for each considered country.” The authors are surely</p>
              <p>aware that published numbers of currently infectious cases poorly</p>
              <p>represent true infectious cases. So, this should at least be discussed</p>
              <p>more carefully. Moreover, this information risks of being severely</p>
              <p>biased when you aim at making comparisons between different countries –</p>
              <p>especially during the first wave - because it reflects the inter-country</p>
              <p>differences in testing and tracing, making comparisons unreliable.</p>
              <p>L&gt;140. Fitting procedures. The authors adopted a nonlinear least squares</p>
              <p>procedure citing a rather old textbook whereas the basic statistics of</p>
              <p>epidemic data has progressed dramatically in the last twenty years,</p>
              <p>first of all maximum likelihood techniques. For example, I do not</p>
              <p>understand how the quantity in (3) can be used to document the</p>
              <p>improvement in fit compared to the baseline model.</p>
              <p>L83 “the time T passed until no new infections occur”, this is quite</p>
              <p>wrong at least as far as your model is a deterministic one, as I</p>
              <p>understand it is. In the practice of simulation this does not need to be</p>
              <p>a problem (and indeed you acknowledge this at a later stage), but the</p>
              <p>sentence should be modified.</p>
              <p>L119, the effective reproduction number is not explicit in the SIR</p>
              <p>model, because the susceptible fraction is not explicit. Therefore, the</p>
              <p>formula drawn from ref [26] is an approximation. The problem is that it</p>
              <p>is far from being general and rests on a number of hypotheses, which I</p>
              <p>find somewhat naive. This also holds for eq (1). I noted that even in</p>
              <p>the cited paper [26] the formula is given without a justification. The</p>
              <p>formula trivially holds if you assume that the removal by segregation of</p>
              <p>the susceptible population occurs rapidly, that is before the</p>
              <p>susceptible population is sufficiently depleted. In this case S(t) =</p>
              <p>Nexp(-\\�t), so that if you additionally assume that \\�t is small (which</p>
              <p>contradicts that segregation occurs fast) and resort to the linear</p>
              <p>approximation of the exponential function you arrive to the point.</p>
              <p>Anyhow, is this relevant for this paper? On top, I recommend to avoid to</p>
              <p>cite whatever paper appeared in this epoch because the quality is not</p>
              <p>necessarily good (sometimes poor) and may induce errors in readers.</p>
              <p>Legends of simulation exercises are scanty and should be improved.</p>
              <p>Other points</p>
              <p>&gt; L34, “homogeneous propagation media” is naïve for most readers of the</p>
              <p>&gt; Journal; as epidemiologists we speak of “a homogeneously mixing</p>
              <p>&gt; population” which is a nowadays somewhat universally agreed</p>
              <p>&gt; terminology.</p>
              <p>IBM models are not continuous but discrete models (due to their very</p>
              <p>structure of simulative models)</p>
              <p>L42, "likely" : socially active and at risk of infection</p>
              <p>L83 Clearly, the SEIR model by its I curve provides only a very indirect</p>
              <p>measure of the pressure on PH system (instead represented by ICU and</p>
              <p>hospitals occupancy). Even more so for the economic system. This should</p>
              <p>be discussed.</p>
              <p>L112 “resulting in the effective reproduction number”, In epidemiology</p>
              <p>the effective reproduction number deals with a situation where the</p>
              <p>susceptible proportion is depleted below one, as you correctly say in</p>
              <p>the subsequent line. Suggest to rephrase.</p>
              <p>L126 “We use mean values etc”, please clarify</p>
              <p>L129 “with conservation of the total number of individuals, meaning N’ =</p>
              <p>0”, the argument goes the other way round, your system fulfills N’=0</p>
              <p>implying that N is conserved.</p>
              <p>L86 “Mainstream suppression measures against the epidemic aim at</p>
              <p>flattening the curve of new infections”, replace “suppression “ by</p>
              <p>“mitigation” (flattening the epidemic curve is somewhat different from</p>
              <p>suppressing)</p>
              <p>L161 “comparative information analysis” this is not an agree terminology</p>
              <p>Minor points</p>
              <p>I suggest to delete “new” from the abstract and simply state: “an</p>
              <p>extended SEIR model including quarantine of susceptible an latently</p>
              <p>infected individuals”</p>
              <p>L8 “statistical methods allow for accurate characterization of the</p>
              <p>population's health state", stated like this is a bit trivial.</p>

              <p>The paper introduces in the SEIR model 3 different types of non-pharmaceutical interventions i.e. social distancing, quarantine of exposed individuals and generalized lock-down. After the outbreak of COVID pandemic several papers have been published in this direction e.g.</p>

              <p>Many other papers have been recently published or submitted.</p>
              <p>&gt;We updated out bibliography with recent publications, including some of the ones mentioned above [6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 16, 18, 35, 45, 49, 52, 55, 56, 57]. We also integrated our references with a discussion of relevance of epidemic control not only on the healthcare [17,18,31], but also on the economic system [32,33,34]. Additionally, we discussed the reliability of the empirical data used for model fitting. In fact, we payed particular attention that, across the analysed countries, the share of positive tests was similar [27] and no significant deviation from expected dynamics was observed by studies applying Benford’slaw [28, 29].</p>
              <p>Regarding the vast recent modelling literature, several studies have deeply analyzed the effects of specific interventions in selected countries, by statistical methods on simple and interpretable SIR-like models [1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18, 35, 44], while in our study we consider the plausible impact of a combination of multiple strategies, and the difference from applying single interventions. A similar analysis was done with complex and data-demanding agent-based models [3, 31], which are often less generic, since focusing mostly on one country at a time. Instead, our model provides generic results that can be valid over several countries as shown in Fig. 9. Other works focus on single interventions with stochastic models [45, 55, 59]; we complement them by a different perspective. Many papers are focused on developing future projections [17, 41, 42, 60], but our aim is to discuss how to obtain similar mitigation with different strategies, to inform future decisions. As pointed out by Reviewer#1 below, additional papers account for extra features of importance for pandemic modelling. We discuss this in our response below. We are aware of abundant literature that consider conceptual models and the effect of different parameters (either published [11,12] or as preprints, e.g. Chladnà, medRxiv, 2020). We believe that our additional comparison with empirical data (Fig. 9) can contribute to the discussion about the relevance of such abstract strategies in real-world settings. Finally, our choice of modelling and selection of empirical data is based on socio-political analysis reports (sec 2.2 and Table 1), thus incorporating a multi-disciplinary approach in our study.</p>
              <p>In these models often several aspects are taken into account which are overlooked in the present paper e.g. hospitalization, asymptomatic individuals, heterogeneous behavior of the individuals. The authors should explain what is the main advance with respect the vast recent literature.</p>
              <p>&gt;Our paper aims at complementing the recent literature by synthetizing several control strategies into a readily interpretable model and by assessing their efficacy both alone and in synergy. This way, we can discuss the merits of each strategy and the possibility of mitigating the curve by a combination of them. The paper focuses on the average effects of such strategies on the infectious curve. We ultimately show that analogous containment levels of the infectious curve can be achieved by alternative synergies of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Hence, policymakers could aim to achieve the desired mitigation by measures targeting different population groups. This synergistic approach still remains of high importance in these second/third waves, where countries need to balance different non-pharmaceutical interventions to keep the infection at bay, while containing the impacts on other aspects of society. Following the remarks by reviewers, and recent literature, we have included isolation of infectious individuals into the model and simulations, on top of isolation of latent carriers. </p>
              <p>We acknowledge that there are aspects of the pandemic found in other studies that were overlooked here, such as hospitalization, asymptomatic individuals, and heterogeneous behaviour of individuals. While these are all important aspects that can be crucial to answer certain questions, they are not needed here to answer the main question of the present paper: how strategies mitigate the infectious curve. Asymptomatic/undetected cases do play a role on the infection curve, but estimating their numbers is affected by large uncertainties. Thus, we opted for a more conceptual model without explicit asymptomatic/undetected compartments. When we compare our framework to empirical data, our goal is mostly to show that the model can reproduce the realistic dynamics observed in real data across a multitude of countries, and that synergies of several measures applied with moderate intensity can still provide the same benefit than a much more intense application of one intervention only. </p>
              <p>On the other hand, to address different questions that require hospitalizations and asymptomatic/undetected cases, our group carried out a distinct study that includes such additional aspects, plus deaths and vaccination, throughout several epidemic waves (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249088v1.full">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249088v1.full</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>In this respect, the authors consider the simultaneous adoption of three different kinds of measures, however it is not clear in the paper what is the main advantages of introducing this modelization. In particular which are the different effects due to the three strategy of containment? E.g. when you consider the fit of datasets the use of a single strategy (i.e. social distancing) provides a very similar fit of the case where the synergy of the different strategies is considered; also the improvement in the X^2 is very small. So it is not clear what is the advantage of adopting the different strategies, in the description of non-pharmaceutical interventions. </p>
              <p>&gt;The model links several control strategies to real-world intervention programs, to investigate the possibility of achieving similar mitigation effects by using different strategies. The possibility of choosing among several strategies is of practical importance for decision makers. The impact of said strategies on the infectious curve is investigated in the dedicated sections (3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.1.4) and in panels (a) of Fig. 2, 3, 5 and 7). Increasing social distancing delays and decrease the height of the peak of infections. Increasing active protection as well decreases the height of the peak of infections, but it anticipates the occurrence of such peak. Increasing active quarantining also delays and decrease the height of the peak of infections like social distancing, but the same decrease in height of the peak by active quarantining is associated with shorter delay than with social distancing. The effects of measures targeting S and E population groups is also compared with those of isolation of contagious individuals (3.1.4). This shows how much preventive measures can buffer imperfect isolation of I persons. While not described by the model, these strategies are also expected to potentially have different effects on the population at the economic, social and psychological levels. </p>
              <p>In addition, the performed fitting illustrates how well we can explain the evolution of empirical infectious curves with different control strategies. The chi^2 illustrates that the epidemic curves from 6 countries could indeed be fitted equally well (similar X^2, only small changes) by either a strong “social distancing” intervention or by milder \\rho and synergistic measures. This is clearer in Fig.9 of the new version, where we also consider the isolation of infectious individuals. Moreover, we observe a high degree of correlation among some parameters. This is informative about the advantage of adopting a synergy of interventions instead of just one (e.g. only social distancing), in that it achieves a similar mitigation of the infection curve with interventions that can be selected based on the goal of limiting the impact on economy and society. This analysis can thus inform policymakers about the effects of strengthening non-pharmaceutical interventions others than social distancing, as e.g. contact tracing, mass testing, rapid testing.</p>
              <p>In summary the paper introduces a model with a description of three types of non-pharmaceutical interventions, this interventions have been already introduced in different papers even if with some differences. In this context, from a theoretical point of view the authors do not evidence any peculiar or interesting effect due to the presence of these three terms; while a comparison with datasets does not show any advantages in interpretations of the epidemic evolution in the different countries. In this perspective I think that the paper is not suitable for publication without a significant improvement.</p>
              <p>We complement the analysis of other valuable works, by considering combinations of control interventions in a simple, easily interpretable SIR-like model. Some seminal works did so with Agent-based models (e.g. [31]) but they require large and variegate data sets and are often less generic, since focusing mostly on one country at a time. Here, we highlight a general finding, which we found occurring in multiple countries. Introducing new terms allows for clearer interpretation of the effect of distinct control strategies that can achieve the same mitigation as untargeted, population-wide social distancing. From our experience in the Luxembourg COVID-19 Taskforce, this is useful to balance different options in decision making. The key message of our study is that fostering, strengthening and empowering additional interventions (other than social distancing) can achieve the same mitigation on the infection curve. This is investigated both from a conceptual point of view (Fig. 8) and by considering the evolution of empirical data under mitigation strategies (Fig.9). In the latter, differences in rho might appear small, but in fact correspond to significant changes in people’s lifestyle in terms of measures employed to obtain them (curfew, home office, closure of restaurants, shops, recreational activities, sport clubs and ultimately lockdown). Changes in the second digit of \\rho do correspond to significant changes in lifestyle for a considerable amount of people, see e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249088v1.full">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249088v1.full</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>Another very important remark is about the model for a generalized lock-down. In your approach only susceptible nodes are isolated in the state P while I expect that a fraction of the whole population in a lock-down is isolated; in particular I expect that the sudden isolation of infected and exposed individuals should have a larger effect than the isolation of susceptible ones. Moreover I think that the process should be described only by the approach in figure 4 i.e. a sudden isolation of a large number of individuals which remain isolated during the whole period of non-pharmaceutical interventions; while other individuals do not self isolates (e.g. they do an essential job), so that after the quick self isolation mu is restored to 0. On the other hand, a self isolation with constant rate, in the whole period of intervention seems to be very unlikely. An even a similar and simpler model of a generalized lock down could be at the beginning of the intervention an instantaneous isolation in the state P of a fraction of individuals (independently of their states). Therefore, I think that the different scenarios and the data fitting should take into account only the approach in figure 4 (clearly with possible different fraction of people that self isolate).</p>
              <p>&gt;The approach described by Reviewer#1 was used for the fitting, in which a fraction of individuals (independently of their state) is isolated or disconnected through the action of all parameters together. Indeed, we used the mu_ld from Fig.4 for the fitting. Following Reviewer#1 comments, we edited the text to make the point clearer (“For the protection parameter, we used μ_ld acting on 4 days (as analysed in Fig. 4) since it better reflects the rapid isolation that happened during the first COVID-19 wave”, Line 369) and we corrected the labels in Fig. 9. </p>
              <p>Reviewer#2: </p>
              <p>Evaluation</p>
              <p>The paper has a number of shortcomings, and would require a much deeper discussion of several parts (see my main points). Also, the epidemiological language should be improved in many points. Some cited papers are weak. Therefore, the authors should (i) do an effort to (substantially) amend their paper according to the indications reported below, but especially (ii) put into evidence their findings that are of main epidemiological interest, particularly in relation to the insights that the adopted modeling framework would provide in relation to the understanding of COVID-19 control.</p>
              <p>&gt;We thank Reviewer#2 for his/her careful comments and remarks.</p>
              <p>Main points</p>
              <p>The proposed SPQEIR model is quite restrictive in its formulation and therefore the underlying hypotheses should be carefully discussed. First, P individuals are – according to the stated hypotheses – fully protected, which corresponds to full segregation forever i.e., during the entire history of intervention measures. But measures aimed at confining susceptible people hardly can go beyond home confinement, and there is strong evidence that – during lockdowns - much COVID transmission occurred within households (especially during the first wave). Pairwise, also removed E individuals are fully inactivated in the SPEIR. Also, this should be discussed carefully. </p>
              <p>&gt;We included these points for discussion and disclosed the model assumptions more explicitly (Sec 2.3 and Discussion, lines 473-485). In general, such points would indeed diminish the effectiveness of the control strategies, for which we assess the theoretical impact. We agree that including these aspects would likely make a significant difference on the exact values of the model variables during the epidemic waves. Nevertheless, we believe that they would not impact our take home message, i.e. that different measures impact differently the epidemic curves, but the same desired mitigation of the infectious curve can be obtained by social distancing plus synergies of other measures with potentially smaller socio-economic impact. We indeed proved this for 6 European countries. Fitting their data using either social distancing alone, or a synergy of strategies, results in milder social distancing (higher rho), thus assessing the generality of this finding.</p>
              <p>Moreover, as E individuals can be removed mostly by way of tracing, it is not clear to me why you do not allow a pairwise option for I individuals (e.g. asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic) by the same mechanism. Last, I understand screening and isolation of actively infected individuals is incorporated into removal (L99), which is an option. However, did you handle your removal rate to account for this (perhaps I didn’t note details)?</p>
              <p>We agree with Reviewer#2’s remarks. The reason why we originally did not allow a pairwise option for I individuals, i.e. the possibility for I individuals to be removed from the infectious pool by quarantining, is that the first focus of the study was on investigating the role and the importance of preventive measures targeting S and E population groups, like tracing (e.g by app), protection of vulnerable individuals, and social distancing. Nevertheless, we fully agree that these neglect the fact that, once a person has become infectious (I), he/she might be tested and subsequently before having naturally recovered. Comparing the effect of this intervention with preventive ones is therefore very interesting. Hence, we modified the model, simulations and figures to incorporate this advice from reviewer 2. In particular, the ODEs are modified by an extra parameter \\eta handling the removal rate, which in turn modifies R (Eq. 1). Then, we performed its systematic analysis in Sec. 3.1.4 and Fig. 7. The proposed synergies (Sec 3.2 and Fig. 8) now take \\eta into account, as well as the fitting performed in Fig. 9. For fitting, we assumed by default that all countries worked to isolate contagious individuals; hence, the parameter \\eta is associated to all. This is also disclosed in the description of Table 1. In other sections, the text was edited accordingly (Lines 151-154, 434-440). </p>
              <p>L141 “We fit the model to the official number of currently infected (active) cases, for each considered country.” The authors are surely aware that published numbers of currently infectious cases poorly represent true infectious cases. So, this should at least be discussed more carefully. Moreover, this information risks of being severely biased when you aim at making comparisons between different countries – especially during the first wave - because it reflects the inter-country differences in testing and tracing, making comparisons unreliable.</p>
              <p>&gt;We agree with the reviewer that published data of currently infected cases do not fully represent the true infectious cases, largely due to a fraction undetected cases, either because asymptomatic or because of lack of sufficient testing. Estimating this fraction of undetected can be based on prevalence studies based on antibodies tests, but ultimately this fraction remains largely uncertain. Thus, we decided not to employ such estimates in our model, as we considered the measured numbers of detected cases sufficient for the scope of our study, which is not to produce projections of the future evolution of the epidemic. Instead, it is intended to show how a synergy of measures could explain the observed curves of infection as nicely as social distancing alone, with lower levels of social distancing itself. </p>
              <p>When choosing the countries for the subsequent analysis, we considered those with similar share of positive tests, aiming at excluding countries with too inefficient testing strategies and thus with overwhelmingly high numbers of undetected cases. We would like to stress that, while we do fit to 6 countries, our aim is not to compare the numbers of active infections between countries, but rather to verify our analysis of the effect of synergies on a number of real-world settings. Moreover, our focus is not on the values of active cases between countries, but rather on their dynamics, i.e. the shape of the infections curves. In addition, recent studies showed no statistically significant divergence of the data of the considered countries from theoretical trends [28,29]. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that these time-series data are capturing plausible time evolutions, which are thus informative of the epidemic dynamic. </p>
              <p>In general, we acknowledge that Reviewer#2’s remark is particularly important for the overall interpretation of the results, so we broadened our discussion and reported the above discussion in the text (Lines 87-95 and 491-498).</p>
              <p>L140. Fitting procedures. The authors adopted a nonlinear least squares procedure citing a rather old textbook whereas the basic statistics of epidemic data has progressed dramatically in the last twenty years, first of all maximum likelihood techniques. For example, I do not understand how the quantity in (3) can be used to document the improvement in fit compared to the baseline model.</p>
              <p>&gt;We acknowledge that most advanced inference techniques exist and are often employed in other frameworks. For instance, in a recent follow up study that our group developed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249088v1.full">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249088v1.full</ext-link>, we employed Bayesian inference relying on Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods to fit an extension of the present model. Here we considered the number of parameters small enough and the problem simple enough to justify the use of a simple non-linear least squares. Thus, the fitting procedure applied in this study relied on a non-linear Python pipeline that is in common use for problems with similar degrees of freedom as ours. To support that the method is enough for the goal, we can observe in Fig. 9 that the parameter values obtained allow to the model simulation to fit reasonably well the time-series data. </p>
              <p>Finally, the reduced chi squared metric of eq.3 was not used for fitting, but to assess the goodness-of-fit, as it is a common diagnostic tool [Maydeu-Olivares, Alberto. "Maximum likelihood estimation of structural equation models for continuous data: Standard errors and goodness of fit." Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal 24.3 (2017): 383-394.; but also: Wen, Zhonglin, Kit-Tai Hau, and W. Marsh Herbert. "Structural equation model testing: Cutoff criteria for goodness of fit indices and chi-square test." Acta psychologica sinica 36.02 (2004): 186-194.]. The statistical justifications for this can be found e.g. in [43]. In fact, the chi square is the simplest possible form of the likelihood, obtained when writing the likelihood function assuming that errors on the measurement of the data are Gaussian distributed. In absence of better knowledge on the sources of errors on the available data, Gaussian distributed errors are the most common assumption in mean field models. An intuitive understanding can be gained as follows. The reduced chi square (3) is a quantity based on summing up the square distances of data-points from corresponding simulation values. It does provide a measure of the geometrical distance between the model simulation and the datapoints. Thus, smaller reduced chi square means smaller distance between model simulation and data, i.e. better fit. Thus, computing the quantity (3) for two models (e.g. the baseline model and the model with synergies) and comparing the two obtained numbers allow to asses which of the two models provide a better fit to the data. </p>
              <p>L83 “the time T passed until no new infections occur”, this is quite wrong at least as far as your model is a deterministic one, as I understand it is. In the practice of simulation this does not need to be a problem (and indeed you acknowledge this at a later stage), but the sentence should be modified.</p>
              <p>&gt;We agree, thus the sentence has now been modified (Line 108).</p>
              <p>L119, the effective reproduction number is not explicit in the SIR model, because the susceptible fraction is not explicit. Therefore, the formula drawn from ref [26] is an approximation. The problem is that it is far from being general and rests on a number of hypotheses, which I find somewhat naive. This also holds for eq (1). I noted that even in the cited paper [26] the formula is given without a justification. The formula trivially holds if you assume that the removal by segregation of the susceptible population occurs rapidly, that is before the susceptible population is sufficiently depleted. In this case S(t) = Nexp(-\\�t), so that if you additionally assume that \\�t is small (which contradicts that segregation occurs fast) and resort to the linear approximation of the exponential function you arrive to the point. Anyhow, is this relevant for this paper? On top, I recommend to avoid to cite whatever paper appeared in this epoch because the quality is not necessarily good (sometimes poor) and may induce errors in readers.</p>
              <p>&gt;We agree with Reviewer#2’s analysis and his/her remark that, in fact, an explicit dependence to mu does not hold in case of hard lockdown (e.g Fig. 4) and does not add value to our analysis. Hence, we edited the text accordingly (line), by avoiding citing poorly supported papers and by editing eq. 1 in general terms that are not subject to the mentioned assumptions. The subsequent analysis is performed following the updated eq.1.</p>
              <p>As for the remark about recent literature, we agree about being careful when citing non-peer reviewed works from the latest months. We amended our bibliography in this respect.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors now clarify the main claim of their work: "We ultimately show that analogous containment levels of the infectious curve can be achieved by alternative synergies of non-pharmaceutical interventions." So the message of the paper now is clear and one can better evaluate the results. However several important points in my opinion still require improvement.</p>
              <p>- The authors claim that similar results can be obtained with different interventions. Figure 8 indeed provides similar curves for the first 4 scenarios where the value of the effective reproductive number is similar, while the evolution of scenarios 5 and 6 is different but these scenarios present a different effective R. In this perspective one could infer that scenarios with similar reproductive number display similar epidemic evolution, which is not surprising. Can you discuss this point? Moreover, you fit the data set using as fitting parameters only social distancing or considering all the parameters of the non-pharmaceutical interventions. Similar quality of the fittings are obtained, evidencing that different approachess can be adopted. However, the fit with the whole parameter set is very similar to the case where only social distancing is present (the parameters rho are close, while mu_ld chi and eta are very small). Therefore one could suppose that social distancing is the main intervention observed in the data. What happens e.g. if you consider in the fit only a lock down, which has been a common intervention in the first wave of COVID 19? You state that important correlations among the fitting parameters is observed. It should be interesting if you are able to show what is the region in the parameter space (rho,mu_ld, eta) where you obtain a nice fitting of the epidemic curves with a similar (small) value of chi^2. In this way one could compare the relevance of the different possible interventions. According to the previous hypothesis this region should correspond to a region at constant value of the reproductive number.</p>
              <p>- A small constant value of mu as modelling of protection in my opinion is not realistic. The case where a fraction of the population isolate in a small time well represent a lock down. While a constant rate of isolation during the whole epidemics it seems to me that do not represent a realistic non pharmaceutical intervention. While people should self isolate with a small constant rate? On the other hand, a constant mu could well represent vaccination which is not a pharmaceutical intervention. Moreover, the sentence: "In particular, μ = 0.01 d −1 ..... through isolation, this is unrealistic." seems to be in contrast with the large value of mu of figure 2.</p>
              <p>- In the lock down description where a large value of mu is activated for a small time to isolate quickly a finite fraction of the population I do not understand why only susceptible people are put into quarantine. I expect that a general measure as a lock down involves all the population including also exposed and infected individuals. Indeed the aim of a lock down is not only protection of the susceptible nodes but also isolation of potentially infected people.</p>
              <p>- 10 days from the onset of the first contagion is an arbitrary choice. The importance of an early adoption of measure of containment is a well known fact. Clearly 10 days belongs to such early adoption framework what happens if measures are taken after a longer time. The different strategies are still equivalent?</p>
              <p>- I do not understand the sentence: "However, we notice that values of ρ ' 0.3 or lower are more effective in mitigating the epidemic faster.?" clearly the smaller is rho the more is effective the measure to contain the epidemics, but what is the relevance of this comment?</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear editor, dear reviewers,</p>
              <p>We are glad that Reviewer #2 is entirely satisfied by our revision, and we thank Reviewer #1 for the list of suggested improvements, which encouraged us to significantly extend our work, and making it more complete. Please find below detailed responses to the points that were raised. Our responses are in blue. In the main text, the parts that we edited based on comments from Reviewer #1 are in red. Following Reviewer #1 suggestions, we performed the analysis of further interesting aspects that complement the main findings reported in the manuscript, and we created a Supplementary Information S1 Text to discuss those additional analysis.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors now clarify the main claim of their work: "We ultimately show that analogous containment levels of the infectious curve can be achieved by alternative synergies of non-pharmaceutical interventions." So the message of the paper now is clear and one can better evaluate the results. However several important points in my opinion still require improvement.</p>
              <p>- The authors claim that similar results can be obtained with different interventions. Figure 8 indeed provides similar curves for the first 4 scenarios where the value of the effective reproductive number is similar, while the evolution of scenarios 5 and 6 is different but these scenarios present a different effective R. In this perspective one could infer that scenarios with similar reproductive number display similar epidemic evolution, which is not surprising. Can you discuss this point? </p>
              <p>The point raised by Reviewer #1 is correct. It is indeed known that epidemic dynamics are driven by the control parameter R_eff. However, there are multiple ways to achieve the same R_eff. Indeed, R_eff results from different combinations of finer-gained parameters. Figure 8 shows how to achieve fine-tuning of different interventions by acting on specific parameters, which could eventually be lumped into the global R_eff as explained in Eq. 1. While Fig. 8 displays a limited number of example scenarios, others can be simulated with our companion Shinyapp (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jose-ameijeiras.shinyapps.io/SPQEIR_model/">https://jose-ameijeiras.shinyapps.io/SPQEIR_model/</ext-link>). Following Rev. #1’s suggestion, we discussed this point further in the text (Sec. 3.2). </p>
              <p>- Moreover, you fit the data set using as fitting parameters only social distancing or considering all the parameters of the non-pharmaceutical interventions. Similar quality of the fittings are obtained, evidencing that different approachess can be adopted. However, the fit with the whole parameter set is very similar to the case where only social distancing is present (the parameters rho are close, while mu_ld chi and eta are very small). Therefore one could suppose that social distancing is the main intervention observed in the data. </p>
              <p>The fitting called “only social distancing” is primarily performed to assess a reasonable value for R_eff that is less sensitive to the identifiability issue (fitting degenerate parameters) discussed in the text. This is done to make a comparison with the R_eff value obtained with fine-grained parameters fitting. Indeed, we observe that social distancing plays an important role even for the other combinations of interventions, which is not surprising as it is the main population-wide intervention during European-like lockdowns (as also reported in Table 1), while others are more targeted to individuals. Nonetheless, other parameters, despite being low, induce non-negligible impacts (for instance, a moderately high number of individuals flow into the outer compartments, as reported in Table1 of SI Text). We discuss this impact in the main text (Sec. 3.3 and 4) as well as in the new Supplementary Information SI Text (SI Sec. 2), which was added for this purpose. </p>
              <p>- What happens e.g. if you consider in the fit only a lock down, which has been a common intervention in the first wave of COVID 19?</p>
              <p>Our strategy was based on fitting only those parameters that are associated with interventions observed and reported in the considered countries (as discussed in Table 1 of Main Text). Hence, we did not perform different fitting with alternative parameters combinations, that were instead not observed in reality (cf. ACAPS database reference in Main Text). As this goes beyond the scopes of the present manuscript, further studies might investigate these aspects. To improve the discussion, we expanded this point in the text (Sec. 3).</p>
              <p>- You state that important correlations among the fitting parameters is observed. It should be interesting if you are able to show what is the region in the parameter space (rho,mu_ld, eta) where you obtain a nice fitting of the epidemic curves with a similar (small) value of chi^2. In this way one could compare the relevance of the different possible interventions. According to the previous hypothesis this region should correspond to a region at constant value of the reproductive number.</p>
              <p>The identifiability of epidemiological parameters is indeed an interesting point. To better explore the parameter space, we expanded our previous analysis, that was based on a gradient descent non-linear fitting from the lmfit python library. The new extension of our analysis was performed with a Bayesian Inference framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. This allowed a better exploration of the parameters space, highlighting regions corresponding to similar R_eff values and similar fitness to data. This additional analysis is now included in the new Supplementary Information SI Text (SI Sec. 2). Figs. 5-7 outline the areas of parameter space (for different couples of parameters and different countries) corresponding to a high posterior probability, and thus a good fitness of the model to the data.</p>
              <p>- A small constant value of mu as modelling of protection in my opinion is not realistic. The case where a fraction of the population isolate in a small time well represent a lock down. While a constant rate of isolation during the whole epidemics it seems to me that do not represent a realistic non pharmaceutical intervention. While people should self isolate with a small constant rate? On the other hand, a constant mu could well represent vaccination which is not a pharmaceutical intervention. Moreover, the sentence: "In particular, μ = 0.01 d −1 ..... through isolation, this is unrealistic." seems to be in contrast with the large value of mu of figure 2.</p>
              <p>We agree with Reviewer #1’s comment and we edited the considered sentences accordingly. </p>
              <p>In general, small \\mu values are investigated in their corresponding section to complete the conceptual analysis, but only high values during a short time were used to perform the country-wise fitting, thus mimicking the beginning of a lockdown in Europe and reproducing the behavior discussed in Fig. 4.</p>
              <p>- In the lock down description where a large value of mu is activated for a small time to isolate quickly a finite fraction of the population I do not understand why only susceptible people are put into quarantine. I expect that a general measure as a lock down involves all the population including also exposed and infected individuals. Indeed the aim of a lock down is not only protection of the susceptible nodes but also isolation of potentially infected people.</p>
              <p>This is indeed an important point. From a modelling perspective, all outfluxes from the main epidemic compartments (framed in Fig.1) to Q and P compartments correspond to isolating measures. During the whole intervention period, all outflux parameters are active, thus modelling the observed interventions that were applied during European-like lockdowns, which also targeted potentially infected people as explained in Table 1. </p>
              <p>On the other hand, we named the intervention parameters after the compartment they act upon. So the action of “protection” is on susceptibles only, whereas the removal of individuals from the infectious compartments (framed in Fig.1) comes from the combination of all outflux parameters.</p>
              <p>- 10 days from the onset of the first contagion is an arbitrary choice. The importance of an early adoption of measure of containment is a well known fact. Clearly 10 days belongs to such early adoption framework what happens if measures are taken after a longer time. The different strategies are still equivalent?</p>
              <p>We agree with the reviewer that 10 days is to some extent arbitrary. This aspect is indeed of interest for readers, as the delay \\tau represents an extra parameter that might influence the dynamics. To answer in detail and to improve the content of our manuscript, we performed additional simulations and included an extended discussion section in the Supplementary Information SI Text (SI Sec. 1). We observe that the qualitative evolution (trends, dependence on parameters, etc.) of the epidemic curve under interventions does not change, and its quantitative details (height of the peak, absolute number of days until mitigation) change according to Figs. SI 1-4. Of particular interest is the resulting tradeoff of prompt-but-weak and delayed-but-strong interventions, which cause different quantitative outcomes. Interestingly, such outcomes are currently observed in several European countries. </p>
              <p>- I do not understand the sentence: "However, we notice that values of ρ ' 0.3 or lower are more effective in mitigating the epidemic faster.?" clearly the smaller is rho the more is effective the measure to contain the epidemics, but what is the relevance of this comment?</p>
              <p>In Fig.2c of main text, we highlight a non-monotonous and, more intriguing, non-linear relationship between the peak height (and the mitigation timing) and the intervention parameters. The aforementioned sentence was intended to stress this point, and the fact that there are certain parameter values that minimize the peak and the timing. However, we acknowledge that it was initially not entirely clear, and we now edited the text accordingly. </p>
              <p>We thank Reviewer #1 for his/her feedback, which led us to perform further analysis and increase the depth of the manuscript.</p>

              <p>In my opinion this should be a correct approach: during a lock down the same fraction of S, E and I individuals are typically protected. If this is the case it should be explained, otherwise if you set only mu=mu_ld, the model isolate only susceptible individuals during a lock down which is not very likely and some explanations should be added.</p>
              <p>The authors introduce, in the supplementary, the analysis of the posterior probability distribution for different values of the parameters, evidencing that a nice fit of the experimental data is obtained in a wide region of the parameter set. This nice point answer to one of my previous question. However, I do not understand in figures 5,6 and 7 when you plot the probability as a function of two of the parameters how do you fix the value of the other parameters which are not consider in the plot.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear editor, dear reviewers,</p>
              <p>Once again, we thank the reviewers for their further suggestions and improvements. Please find below detailed answers to the questions raised, and explanations on how we tackled the points specified by reviewer #1. Our responses are in blue. In the main text, the parts we edited following your suggestions are in red. </p>
              <p>- Reviewer #1: The authors have answered to my previous questions and in general the paper is improved accordingly.</p>
              <p>However some points still require an improvement:</p>
              <p>- My comment on the fact that during a lock down not only susceptible individuals are removed but also infected and exposed, has not been addressed clearly:</p>
              <p>"This is indeed an important point. From a modelling perspective, ........the</p>
              <p>combination of all out-flux parameters" If this means that during the short period of isolation of individuals (4 days) you set mu=mu_ld but also eta=mu_ld and xi=mu_ld so that also exposed and infected individuals are removed with the same rate?</p>
              <p>In my opinion this should be a correct approach: during a lock down the same fraction of S, E and I individuals are typically protected. If this is the case it should be explained, otherwise if you set only mu=mu_ld, the model isolate only susceptible individuals during a lock down which is not very likely and some explanations should be added.</p>
              <p>We fully agree with Reviewer #1 that the suggested fitting scheme is more realistic. Hence, following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now tested both methods (mu=mu_ld, as we employed so far, and all parameters=mu_ld during the initial 4 days of rapid isolation). While the latter is more realistic, as mentioned, the “mu=mu_ld” method is better connected to our conceptual analysis. Thus, testing both methods give an indication if a more complex model improves the goodness of fit.</p>
              <p>Hence, we performed the fitting to country data with one method at a time, thus obtaining two sets of fitted parameters rho, mu_ld, eta etc., like in Fig.9. Our results confirm that, during the first epidemic wave, the two approaches yield similar quantitative results, as the fitted parameters differ only in the second significative digit while the reduced chi-squared metrics gets slightly worse. Thus, we can conclude the two approaches reproduce the epidemic dynamics equally well, leaving our conclusions unaltered. For illustration, we report fitting values for some example countries. Others display similar subtle changes.</p>

              <p>mu_ld acting on all compartments; 0.30; 0.001; 0.001; 0.001; 0.7; 4.4888e-08</p>
              <p>Switzerland</p>
              <p>Method; rho; mu_ld; chi’; eta; R; chi2red</p>
              <p>mu_ld acting on S; 0.28; 0.001; 0; 0.001; 0.67; 6.0977e-09</p>
              <p>mu_ld acting on all compartments; 0.276; 0.001; 0; 0.001; 0.66; 6.9493e-09</p>
              <p>This is due to the fact that, at the beginning of the pandemic, the S compartment contains by far the greatest number of individuals (since S~N); hence, parameters related to the S compartment have a larger impact on the infection dynamics. In addition, the overall impact of mu_ld is smaller than that of other parameters, such as rho, because of the nature of European-like lockdowns. In fact, the variable P in our model, controlled by the parameter mu_ld, represents the compartment of individuals with zero probability of getting infected, which correspond to a minority of people, e.g. to elderly people fully isolated and not the majority of individuals who had still some external contacts due to e.g. going to work, having a family member going to work, doing the groceries etc. The effect of the lockdown on these individuals is represented in our model by the parameter rho, which describes a decreased (but not an absence) level of social interactions.</p>
              <p>Following Reviewer#1, we edited the text (lines 386-389) to make this point clearer. </p>
              <p>- The authors introduce, in the supplementary, the analysis of the posterior probability distribution for different values of the parameters, evidencing that a nice fit of the experimental data is obtained in a wide region of the parameter set. This nice point answer to one of my previous question. However, I do not understand in figures 5,6 and 7 when you plot the probability as a function of two of the parameters how do you fix the value of the other parameters which are not consider in the plot.</p>
              <p>We now realised this part was not clearly explained in the text. An important point here is that the parameters are not statistically independent. The posterior distribution for a particular parameter depends on the values of other parameters. Hence, to visualise a joint posterior distribution of 2 parameters from a high dimensional one, we need to first marginalise it against the other parameters. In probability, marginalising corresponds to projecting high dimensional distributions to the dimensions of interest by integrating over the remaining (“marginalised-out”) parameters. As an example, taken from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution</ext-link>, to obtain the marginal probability of x from the joint probability distribution of x and y we would take</p>
              <p>p_X (x)= ∫_y▒〖p_(X|Y) (x|y) p_Y (y)dy〗</p>
              <p>This can also be exemplified by the following figure (CC0, taken from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution</ext-link>), where a 2D distribution (highlighted by the green ellipse) is marginalised over X (leading to the 1D red p(y) distribution) and Y (leading to the 1D blue p(x) one), respectively. </p>

              <p>Similarly, we marginalised the full distribution obtained by MCMC chains to produce Figures 5, 6 and 7 of Supplementary Information. We added the word marginal to clarify this point, and discussed it further in Sup Mat (end of Sectioon 2.2. of Supplementary Information).</p>
              <p>Finally, it has been reported (cf. Table 1) that some countries did not employ certain strategies. Thus, for those countries, the corresponding parameters were fixed to default values as described in Sec. “The extended SPQEIR model to reflect mitigation strategies”.</p>
              <p>- There is a typo at page 12: "Sec. ??"</p>
              <p>The typo has now been corrected, we thank Reviewer#1 for noticing.</p>

              <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
