              <abstract>
                <p>Avian influenza viruses can cause economically devastating diseases in poultry and have the potential for zoonotic transmission. To mitigate the consequences of avian influenza, disease prediction systems have become increasingly important. In this study, we have proposed a framework for the prediction of the occurrence and spread of avian influenza events in a geographical area. The application of the proposed framework was examined in an Indonesian case study. An extensive list of historical data sources containing disease predictors and target variables was used to build spatiotemporal and transactional datasets. To combine disparate sources, data rows were scaled to a temporal scale of 1-week and a spatial scale of 1-degree × 1-degree cells. Given the constructed datasets, underlying patterns in the form of rules explaining the risk of occurrence and spread of avian influenza were discovered. The created rules were combined and ordered based on their importance and then stored in a knowledge base. The results suggested that the proposed framework could act as a tool to gain a broad understanding of the drivers of avian influenza epidemics and may facilitate the prediction of future disease events.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Avian Influenza (AI) disease is caused by influenza type A viruses, which can infect domestic poultry, wild birds and mammalian species, including humans. Despite researchers’ efforts to eradicate and control this disease, it has continuously caused significant losses to poultry and has threatened human lives. To mitigate the impact of AI outbreaks, it is necessary to understand the extent to which different risk factors and their interactions contribute to the introduction and spread of outbreaks. To date, an extensive array of studies have reported on spatiotemporal surveillance and control of AI using approaches, including logistic regression, boosted regression tree, cluster analysis and maximum entropy in different geographical scales. Studies have mapped the distribution of risk [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and identified important risk factors for disease occurrence [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Some studies have performed spatiotemporal surveillance on a country scale such as those in Bangladesh [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], China [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], Indonesia [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], India [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], Thailand [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and Vietnam [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] while others have focused on regional [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or global [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] scales. Such disease risk-profiling approaches could assist in understanding the predictors of disease occurrence and preparing for future events.</p>
              <p>Environmental conditions [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], waterfowl [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], poultry farming and trading activities [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], agricultural activities [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and land cover [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] are identified as major factors of introduction and dispersion of AI occurrence.</p>
              <p>The impact of environmental factors and climate change on the spread and geographical distribution of AI outbreaks is documented in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For example, annual precipitation is introduced as an important predictive variable for the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in China [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Also, in the Middle East, the precipitation in the warmest quarter of a year is positively connected with HPAI H5N1 outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, in Europe [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Bangladesh [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], precipitation is negatively associated with H5N1 outbreaks in wild birds and poultry. Another important factor is the temperature that is positively associated with H5N1 outbreaks in wild birds in Europe [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] while an opposite pattern is found for poultry in Bangladesh [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Moreover, the role of waterfowl density in the distribution of AI outbreaks is highlighted in a number of studies. In Asia [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], domestic waterfowl density appears to be an important risk factor for H5N1 occurrence in poultry. Moreover, a positive association between duck density and H5N1 occurrence is found in Vietnam, Thailand [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], India [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and global scale [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>Similarly, poultry density is considered as one of the factors associated with AI outbreaks. A strong association between HPAI outbreaks and densities of chickens was found in California [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the Middle East [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and globally [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Also, poultry market density in China is considered an important predictor of the risk of AI H7N9. In another study, Henning <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] found that medium poultry density is associated with the risk of H5N1 outbreaks in Vietnam. Contrary to aforementioned studies, Yupiana <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] found a negative association between H5N1 outbreaks and poultry density.</p>
              <p>The spatial distribution of H5N1 outbreaks and its transmission to various regions have been associated with wild bird flyways [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, the introduction of H5N1 to poultry in Europe, Asia and Africa may be partly through wild bird migration [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, in a number of studies [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], a limited or a negative association has been found between migratory waterfowl sites and outbreaks of H5N1.</p>
              <p>Despite the efforts that have been made to determine the essential predictor variables and suitable areas of AI presence, there are still some research gaps that need to be filled.</p>
              <sec id="sec002">
                <title>Motivation</title>
                <p>The present paper is aimed to obtain insights on the prediction of AI events using an extensive spatiotemporal dataset. For this, we identified gaps in the existing research concerning applied predictor variables and methodologies.</p>
                <p>Despite the highlighted importance of risk predictor variables mentioned earlier, the precision and completeness of explanatory data have received limited attention in the literature. For example, a global climate system [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] has been frequently used in AI surveillance studies [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The WorldClim website provides monthly average amount of climatic variables for various spatial resolutions. Clearly, the system only provides historical information and the monthly average of climatic variables is a low temporal resolution. Moreover, the geographic distribution of wild migratory birds has not been included in some existing work [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
                <p>The existing approaches for determining how AI events occur in a region usually rely on regression [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] or boosted regression tree models [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The existing work has aimed to find the most important predictors of disease and then profile the risk of outbreaks. In the aforementioned studies, the average impact of individual risk factors on the output is assessed. However, the identification of subgroups with different risk profiles is overlooked. This can consequently, ignore important information and produce biased results [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Analysis relying on only one or a few numbers of risk factors could ignore important information and produce biased results.</p>
                <p>The application of rule-based prediction models has been limited to a few studies for Dengue [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Depression [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and Diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We are aware of only one study which used rule-based models aimed at analyzing AI outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Xu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] constructed a data cube model with OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) actions. Then, geographical and temporal insights into disease spread with various abstraction levels were extracted. Moreover, sequential pattern mining and association rule mining were applied to provide understandings of potential serial spread routes and linkage between outbreak sites [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The researchers in this study Xu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] used the disease occurrence data regardless of the importance of explanatory variables.</p>
                <p>The present study exploits historical data sources to extract predictive patterns of AI. The approach used here is complementary to prior research with three main contributions: (1) It uses several data sources with high temporal and spatial resolutions. (2) It employs rule-discovery models rather than focusing on predictive regression models commonly used in the relevant existing studies. Rule-discovery models generate patterns that can link the risk of disease presence with subsets of risk factors. (3) It contributes to automation and transparency of predictions. Although transparency of predictions is essential in application areas of epidemiology [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the transparency of surveillance systems and their outcomes has received less attention in the literature. Since the proposed framework used a collection of rules as a high-level description of data, the explanation capability of predictions can be enhanced. This means public health officials can find the reasons behind the predictions made by the system.</p>
                <p>The proposed framework was implemented and tested for an Indonesian case study. Indonesia was selected as a case study as this country has had a high number of reporoted AI outbreaks over the years and, importantly, it provides accessible explanatory data sources. This framework can form a basic model for risk prediction of AI events.</p>

              <p>The main goal here is to extract prediction patterns of AI occurrence from a set of disparate data sources. We designed, implemented and tested a framework with four main parts including data collection, data aggregation and pre-processing, data analysis, and prediction. An overview of the main framework is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245116.g001">Fig 1</xref>.</p>

              <p>In the first step (Data Collection), independent variables were identified and their respective data sources were collected. These variables were identified by the help of subject matter experts and from relevant literature. In the next step (Data Aggregation and Pre-processing), a relational database containing time and geographic information along with several covariates and outcome variables was designed. In the third step (Data Analysis), we applied rule discovery algorithms to the labelled dataset (training dataset) and extracted hidden patterns. These patterns indicated which combination of risk factors had led to high or low risk of disease occurrence and what linkage between event sites had been observed. Moreover, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of predictions. In the last step (Prediction), end-users can communicate with the system through a user interface. Here, the user interface can include mapping and monitoring of the risk, given a current spatiotemporal dataset.</p>

                <p>To build the basis of the model, we divided Indonesia land mass into rectangle cells, each with size 1-degree × 1-degree (equal to 60-minutes arc). A visualization of sample cell centres is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245116.g003">Fig 3</xref>. In addition, the temporal resolution of 1-week was considered. This resolution was selected as it offers a good balance between the precision of decision-making and the time required for data processing. The response variable for each cell (i.e. each row of dataset) was classified as zero if there were no AI events within the cell and during the specified temporal scale. Conversely, if there was at least one disease event within the spatiotemporal scale, the response variable was classified as one. The response variable is demonstrated by ‘has_event’ field in the database schema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245116.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

                </fig>
                <p>The data aggregation was performed in a Structured Query Language table. The response variable describes a disease event that occurred within a certain time interval (week number t) and a spatial compartment with a center of (x,y), where x represents longitude and y represents latitude. The spatiotemporal information in “Indonesia” data tables in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245116.g002">Fig 2</xref> are demonstrated by “week”, “cell_longitude” and “cell_latitude” attributes. Similarly, for other covariates, pre-processing techniques were applied to transform the records into the defined grid-based table. Since the table included coordinate information for each record, a weekly timeline of information could be visualized in maps using GIS software. Moreover, extracted patterns from the grid-based data could be simple and easy to understand.</p>
                <p>The information on AI events in Indonesia was obtained from the Emergency Prevention System for Animal Health (EMPRES) [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The reporting date and geographical coordinates of events in the EMPRES-i platform was used to scale the disease events to specified cells.</p>
                <p>To make a classifier that could predict the response variable based on predictor variables, we divided the data into training and testing sets. The data from 2009 to 2016 was used for training and the data containing 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2017 was used for testing purposes. Overall, the number of observations in the training dataset was 61,152 (147 [number of cells] × 8 [number of years] × 52 [number of weeks per year]) and in the testing dataset was 30,576.</p>
                <p>In total, the training dataset contained 1,860 rows with target variable of one and 59,292 of zero while the testing dataset contained 168 of class one and 30,408 of zero.</p>
                <p>In addition, the explanatory variables were obtained for each spatial and temporal dimension. The “Time Machine Request” type of Darksky API was used to retrieve the climatic information. This returns the observed daily weather conditions given a specified date in the past and a location point. The API responses consist of a JSON-formatted object, from which we selected a set of predictors that have been previously known as factors contributing to outbreaks of AI [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These predictor variables included temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed and pressure.</p>
                <p>The chicken and duck distribution data for Indonesia were computed using The Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The data offered GeoTIFF format files that were converted to longitude-latitude-value format using the Rasterio library in Python [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and then imported to a designed database. The spatial resolution of GLW data (a pixel) was higher than the defined spatial resolution of the present study. Thus, the density points inside a cell have been averaged. However, GLW provides low temporal resolution (2010 only) and therefore the densities have been replicated for all data points with a particular spatial resolution.</p>
                <p>Birdlife species data included shapefiles that could be visualized by geographical information system (GIS) software such as ArcGIS. We filtered polygons related to 133 duck species. In addition, due to the very large size of the data, we simplified the polygons. This enabled us to decrease the processing time. Finally, in the field called ‘bird_existence’ in the database, we specified whether each cell was inside a bird polygon or not.</p>
                <p>In addition to the aforementioned explanatory variables, we defined winter, spring, summer, fall seasons by dividing weeks into 48-12, 12-24, 24-36 and 36-48, respectively. Indonesia is passed by the equator and the weather can be split into dry (May-September) and rainy(October-April) seasons. In the present study, fall and winter divisions represent the rainy season while spring and summer represent the dry season.</p>
                <p>Predictor variables coming from disparate data sources had different spatial and temporal resolutions. Therefore, the variables were arranged with respect to the defined spatial and temporal resolution. When the spatial resolution was higher than a cell or temporal resolution was higher than a week, we averaged the values. Conversely, when the resolution was lower than a cell or a week, we repeated the same values for all the cells that fit into that resolution. Finally, various data sources were assembled into a database with a uniform spatiotemporal resolution.</p>

                <p>Given the created dataset, we employed RuleFit, Frequent Pattern Growth (FP-Growth) and Prefix-projected Sequential Pattern Mining (PrefixSpan) models to discover hidden rules that might be predictive or indicate dispersion paths of the risk of AI occurrence.</p>
                <p>Patterns were extracted in the form of “IF-THEN” rules. The general form of “IF-THEN” rules is demonstrated as follows (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0245116.e001">Eq 1</xref>). Where X is called an antecedent and Y is called a consequent of the rule. The outcome variable (Y) is true if the condition variable (X) is satisfied.

                <p>A rule consists of several interacting risk factors and their ranges. A combination of the extracted rules was used to build the final rule-based classifier.</p>
                <p>Given the prepared training set, a supervised ensemble rule learner (RuleFit) was trained to induce rules. RuleFit [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] is a computational algorithm for rule discovery from a large number of candidate risk factors [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It generates rules by first exhaustively searching for candidate rules over the potential risk factors in the “rule generation” phase. Rules are generated automatically by traversing each path through a decision tree. Subsequently, the redundant and irrelevant rules are pruned out in the “rule pruning” phase [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p>
                <p>Among the advantages of the RuleFit algorithm, several points are of note: 1) This algorithm can rank features by their importance. 2) It outputs interpretable rules. 3) RuleFit relies on a non-parametric model, i.e. Gradient Boosting, with fewer modelling assumptions. Moreover, studies comparing rule extraction methods have shown a competitive accuracy of RuleFit [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p>
                <p>To address the disparity of explanatory variables, these variables were discretized. The categories of very low (VL), low (L), medium (M), high (H) and very high (VH) were calculated based on the histograms of explanatory variables. Moreover, since the dataset was imbalanced, i.e. the number of negative classes was 30 times more than positive classes in the training set, we under-sampled instances of the majority class (one-to-zero ratio of 0.2). Additionally, some data points were discarded due to the high number of missing values. Subsequently, the model was trained with a 5-fold cross-validation. For each subset, the training set was used to learn the rules and the remaining part to evaluate the model.</p>
                <p>In each round, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, precision and F-score metrics. Specificity (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0245116.e003">Eq 3</xref>) measures the proportion of actual negatives that have been correctly identified while sensitivity represents the proportion of actual positives that have been accurately identified (Eqs <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0245116.e004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0245116.e002">2</xref>). Precision represents how many selected cases are relevant and the F-score (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0245116.e005">Eq 5</xref>) is a weighted average of the precision and recall. For two-class classifications, there are four possible cases: For a positive class, if the prediction is positive, this is a called true positive (TP) and if negative, it is a false negative (FN). For a negative example, if the prediction is negative, it is called true negative (TN) and if positive, it is a false positive (FP).</p>
                <p>Next, we used the unsupervised FP-Growth algorithm for mining the rules from the training set. The algorithm was first proposed by Han <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and it mines the frequent itemsets without candidate generation [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The algorithm first compresses the database into a frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree). Then, FP-tree is divided into a set of conditional databases [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The FP-Growth algorithm has proven to be time efficient and to consume less memory than the Apriori Algorithm for mining frequent itemset [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p>
                <p>Extracted rules can be representative of relations between variables in the dataset. The rules indicating a relationship between predictor and response variables were obtained from the FP-Growth algorithm applied to the training set. Similar to the RuleFit, we discretized explanatory variables and additionally, assigned high risk (HR) and low risk (LR) to the response variable for values one and zero, respectively. Following that, the support and confidence criteria were used to select the most important rules. The support of a rule is the number of instances in the dataset that endorses that rule and the confidence indicates the number of times the “IF-THEN” statements are found true.

                  <p>We performed an additional analysis to understand paths by which disease could be transmitted. Such findings could contribute to gaining a better understanding of the risk of AI occurrence. For this, we prepared transactional datasets for each year from 2010 to 2016. Given a year, the sequence of cells containing events along with ranges of their associated risk factors were calculated for each month of the year. An example of the transactional dataset of 2011 prepared for this analysis is provided in <xref rid="pone.0245116.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. For example, in January, a time-line of cells with events starting with cell number 253 is produced. In the Table, symbols of ‘dC’, ‘dD’, ‘t’, ‘h’, ‘pc’ and ‘pr’ denote ‘density of chickens’, ‘density of ducks’, ‘temperature’, ‘humidity’, ‘precipitation’ and ‘pressure’, respectively. Moreover, the subscripts ‘L’, ‘M’, ‘H’ denote ‘very low or low’, ‘medium’, ‘high or very high’, respectively.</p>

                  <p>These datasets were then fed to the PrefixSpan algorithm. PrefixSpan is a well-known sequential pattern mining algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Studies have shown that PrefixSpan, in most cases, outperforms the Apriori-based algorithms such as the GSP (generalized sequential pattern algorithm), FreeSpan (frequent pattern-projected sequential pattern mining), and SPADE (sequential pattern discovery using equivalence classes) [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This is because it finds the frequent items after scanning the sequence data for a single time.</p>
                  <p>The outcome of the analysis, i.e. serial paths of disease spread, can be added to the final knowledge base and contribute to calculating the risk of AI occurrence.</p>

                <p>The extracted rules from the RuleFit and FP-Growth algorithms were ordered using their scores and then two groups of rules were combined to be used for defining a classifier. The process of rule extraction and risk prediction is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245116.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the data set (a ratio of 1:56 of positives to negatives), unseen data points were under-sampled with a positive to negative label ratio of 0.2. Subsequently, for each data point, we searched for up to ten first matching rules. Matching rules are those that their antecedent covers the given data point. We used a variable called ‘determinant’ to determine the class label of data points as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245116.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Each time, if a matching rule was a risk-increasing type, we added one unit to the defined variable and if it was risk-decreasing type, we subtracted one unit from the variable. Finally, data points with an amount more than an integer threshold ranged from minus four to four were determined as ‘at risk of an disease’. Conversely, those with a value less than the threshold were labelled as ‘not at risk of disease’. Comparing these labels with actual ones, we evaluated the results with several measures defined in Eqs <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0245116.e002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0245116.e005">5</xref>.</p>

              <p>We used the measures of support, confidence and coefficient to calculate the degree of importance of the rules. Coefficients represent the change in the response variable for one unit of change in the predictor variable. The importance measure for RuleFit is calculated by the multiplication of coefficient and support measures. The rules with positive coefficient are denoted by “increasing” and negative coefficient by “decreasing” risk types as shown in <xref rid="pone.0245116.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The evaluation of outcomes of the RuleFit algorithm with 5-fold cross-validation showed F-score of 64%.</p>
              <p>To extract rules using FP-Growth, we separated the dataset based on their target label. For each group, given generated rules from the FP-Growth algorithm, relevant rules were selected using a comparative support criterion, in which we took into account the ratio of instances in high and low risk groups. The rules with the measure greater than a threshold were considered relevant. The extracted rules of the form “risk factors → event occurrence risk” are given in <xref rid="pone.0245116.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Low and high risks are denoted by ‘LR’ and ‘HR’ in the table, respectively.</p>
              <p>From the most relevant rules obtained from the RuleFit and FP-Growth, we discovered that the FP-Growth and RuleFit algorithms agreed on the impact of several predictors such as chicken density, duck density, season and temperature. Furthermore, these rules were consistent with similar studies [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], which validated our rule-based analysis.</p>
              <p>Looking at the extracted rules, it is evident that both algorithms agree on the direct relationship between chicken/duck densities and the risk of AI occurrence. This is consistent with the previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], in particular the same results have been obtained for developing countries [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and Indonesia [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p>
              <p>A low or medium amount of precipitation (less than 300 millimetre per month) was associated with AI occurrence, which was detected by both algorithms. This pattern was aligned with the findings of other studies [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Also, both algorithms agreed with regard to finding a connection between rainy season (September-March) and AI occurrence. This might be similar to findings by Loth <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] who outlined that wet summers can have a negative association with AI occurrence.</p>
              <p>While the RuleFit algorithm was able to detect the negative association between temperature and AI presence that has been previously outlined in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245116.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], this association was not found using the FP-Growth algorithm.</p>
              <p>In an additional analysis, we explored frequent sequences of cells with disease occurrence. A sample of outcome results for 2010 to 2012 is given in <xref rid="pone.0245116.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> and also visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245116.g005">Fig 5</xref>. Outcomes indicate the path between the regions of Lampung, West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta and East Java. The most frequent paths were between the Lampung and Yogyakarta, West Java and Yogyakarta, East Java to Central Java, Lampung to Central Java, Central Java to West Java and West Java to Lampung.</p>

                <p>Since the goal of the classifier defined here is to predict disease event occurrence, having a high sensitivity is important. This is because, in such prediction systems, having less false negatives is more desirable than having less false positives. Therefore, a threshold of zero was selected.</p>
                <p>The graph visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245116.g006">Fig 6</xref> represents the trade-off between precision and recall measures.

                <p>Since the dataset here contains more negative than positive classes, precision and recall are better metrics to look at. A refined version of F<sub>1</sub>-score called F<sub>β</sub>-score (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0245116.e006">Eq 6</xref>) is more practical for imbalanced data since it allows for higher weighting of either precision or recall. Given the importance of sensitivity over precision in the current study, in addition to traditional F<sub>1</sub>-score, F<sub>β</sub>-score with β = 2 was reported.</p>
                <p>To compare the performance results with a basic classifier, we applied the Random Forest algorithm with 10-fold cross-validation on unseen data. The result reported in <xref rid="pone.0245116.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> shows that the performance of the proposed classifier is comparable with Random Forest. Although both classifiers gained the same F-measure, giving more importance to sensitivity (i.e. β = 2), the proposed model obtained a higher F<sub>β</sub>-score. It should be noted that different resolutions and case studies in previous studies impede us to make a direct comparison of performance with them [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p>

                <p>Moreover, we generated the cumulative gains curve, which was used to assess the performance of the prediction. It shows the percentage of targets reached when considering a certain percentage of the population. First, all the observations were ordered according to the output of the model. Therefore, observations with the highest rank were placed on the left-hand side of the horizontal axis. The vertical axis of the curve indicates which percentage of true positives included in the curve.</p>
                <p>The chart can tell how much the model predicts better compared to a random selection.

              <title>Conclusion and future work</title>
              <p>Here, we have proposed a framework to discover hidden patterns from an extensive list of data sources using rule-discovery techniques. This framework facilitates the understanding of how AI predictors and occurrence data can be aggregated and pre-processed as input for rule-discovery techniques. Subsequently, a classifier was built from extracted rules to predict the disease presence in new circumstances. This approach is complementary to existing AI risk profiling methods. A rule-set used here can offer easier interpretations of predictions for end-users. This means that users can understand how predictions are made. Also, it is easy to identify which factors have contributed to the predictions and whether the predictions are reasonable. An understanding of risk-increasing factors and their interactions and building risk-profiling maps, can be useful in emergency preparedness. For instance, authorities may use such information to prioritize and target areas for interventions.</p>
              <p>The outcome patterns in this study were consistent with earlier studies. For example, the positive association between disease presence and chicken/duck densities, waterfowl density and the negative association between disease presence and precipitation were aligned with previous studies. Nevertheless, the impact of temperature on disease occurrence showed contradictory results, which might be due to the tropical climate of Indonesia. In Indonesia, the temperature is usually high and does not change much during a year.</p>
              <p>An important limitation of the present study is that the change in the distribution of data through the process of under-sampling without considering the impact of imbalanced data on the classification output might be misleading [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. This is because the removal of examples from the majority class could lead to the loss of potentially important information about the class [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Moreover, further work is required to improve the performance of predictions. One approach is the collection of additional data sources. For example, live bird trades information could be taken into consideration. Trading of live birds is known to be a major pathway of AI transmission that can happen through the movements of contaminated traders [<xref rid="pone.0245116.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. To improve the timeliness of predictions, a continuous pipeline from data collection to analysis is required. It means that during specified time intervals, data is automatically collected, pre-processed, integrated and analysed. The patterns in the rule-base will be updated in each interval, which ensures real-time predictions.</p>
              <p>The proposed framework may provide public health officials and animal health authorities with warnings that can be used for identifying areas with a high risk of disease presence. Such information can potentially be used for response in high priority areas and executing interventions.</p>

              <p>A Framework for Risk Assessment of Avian In Occurrence: An Indonesian Case Study</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Dara,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Both reviewers raise concerns about the submission. The first reviewer, who recommend rejection, is dubious about the actual contribution of the work, which should be properly highlighted and discussed. The second reviewer, on the other hand, recommend that the paper is thoroughly revised, especially to frame it in the correct conceptual context. I think the two reviews are not in contrast, and rather complement each other. I invite the authors to proceed with an extensive and thorough review of the manuscript, which will be send back for a further review to the original reviewers, if possible. </p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Nov 23 2020 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>

              <p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The paper treats the problem of training data set to predict virus diffusion and influence with respect to a time windows of several years. The application proposal is reported about data of a secific case, Indonesian data. A framework for data acquisition composed mainly of three modules is reported. Data acquisition, data management (relational db) and data processing and prediction.</p>
              <p>The database is a very simplified relational db where geographic data are managed as numbers. This is a risky simplification for geographic data. But beside this, the proposed procedure - to the best of the reviewer's knowledge - is a standard analysis and there is little contribution with respect to prediction tools. Geographic information are used and proposed as guide for managing influenza diffusion.</p>
              <p>Case analysis is reported in a too simple if then else structure. Dataset and features selected are not exaclty clear both in the way they are identified as well as the description. Many parts refer to existing tools so it is difficult to gather the right contribution. Also dataset are not available as well as tool. Latter may be useful for a similar application.</p>
              <p>With the pandemia problem, how data and information may be related to virus diffusion may be relevant.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for inviting me to review this manuscript describing rule based methodology and its application to avian influenza outbreaks in Indonesia using data on climatic variables, bird species distribution and poultry density. Overall, I think it is an interesting description of the model process but feel that it would benefit the paper if the application of the model itself is promoted rather than its usefulness as a prediction for avian influenza outbreaks.</p>
              <p>Major issues:</p>
              <p>As it stands the paper does not describe ‘risk assessment’ in its traditional sense rather risk factors or risk prediction. For this reason I would suggest changing the title to something like ‘Application of a rule based prediction model for avian influenza outbreaks in Indonesia’. It might be good to include in the future work section an example of where the model could be applied in a situation where the link between risk factors and disease are more evident. For avian influenza this is quite difficult. You quote Loth et al., 2010 who found that “roads” was a significant risk factor. However, looking more in depth he states that it is ‘Possible contaminated transport vehicles return dirty egg-trays back to the farms, increasing the chance of disease spread. Increased movement over longer distances may increase the disease spread even further. This may explain why “roads” was a significant risk factor.’ By using prediction models such as this one the true picture of the relationship between the risk factors can be missed. For this reason I disagree with the statement that it provides a more holistic understanding of the drivers of AI epidemics. It might also be useful to add a paragraph on how to mitigate outbreaks once they have been predicted e.g. if you know an area has high poultry density and the model predicts high risk, how can this be addressed? Would a campaign for better biosecurity in this area help?</p>
              <p>Minor issues:</p>
              <p>Overall:</p>
              <p>• Throughout the paper please abbreviate avian influenza (AI) when first mentioned and then use abbreviation throughout.</p>
              <p>• Please be consistent with temporal/time or spatial/space</p>
              <p>• How does it take account that there might be a third variable involved e.g. precipitation=standing water=virus survival? See comment above about relationship between risk factors</p>
              <p>Abstract:</p>
              <p>• Suggest change ‘had’ to ‘have’</p>
              <p>• Suggest change ‘to be transmitted to humans’ to ‘for zoonotic transmission’</p>
              <p>• Have disease prediction systems actually been used in reality to mitigate the consequences of avian influenza?</p>
              <p>• ‘In this study, we have proposed a framework for the prediction of the occurrence and spread of avian influenza events in a geographical area.’ This doesn’t match up with the title. Please see comment above</p>
              <p>• ‘Comprehensive list’ implies you used more than 4 data sources and 8 factors. I’m not sure it is comprehensive</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>• Pg 3 Have there been global efforts to eradicate AI? Don’t we just vaccinate humans against influenza annually, so this is control only?</p>
              <p>• Pg 3 Suggest change ‘Had’ threatened human lives’ to ‘has’</p>
              <p>• Pg 3 ‘To mitigate the impact of avian influenza outbreaks, it is necessary to understand the extent to which different risk factors and their interactions contribute to the introduction and spread of outbreaks.’ Overall I’m not sure how any of the sources have in reality been used to mitigate the impact of RA outbreaks? I think the summary here of the contradiction between studies in the association with risk factors proves how difficult it is or proves that there is perhaps a more complex interaction of factors at play.</p>
              <p>• Pg 3 ‘The impact of environmental factors and climate change on the spread and geographical distribution of avian influenza outbreaks is well-known in the literature.’ Not sure this is impact more predictive value</p>
              <p>• Pg 3 Suggest change ‘well known’ to ‘Documented’</p>
              <p>• Pg 3 Suggest change ‘contrary’ to ‘contrast’</p>
              <p>• Pg 3 ‘is positively connected with H5N1’ suggest insert’ HPAI strain’ before H5N1</p>
              <p>• Pg 4 ‘However, Pavade et al. (2011) found connected poultry density to avian influenza outbreaks only for least developed countries that do not have economic growth and financial stability.’ Delete ‘found’. Not sure this is entirely true: is it not more connected to smallholder type farming and poorer between and within farm biosecurity?</p>
              <p>Motivation:</p>
              <p>• Pg 5 ‘Clearly, the system only provides historical information and the temporal resolution is not high enough.’ Not high enough for what?</p>
              <p>• Pg 5 The proposed framework was implemented and tested for an Indonesian case study. Indonesia was selected as a case study as this country has had a high number of avian influenza outbreaks over the years and, importantly, it provides accessible explanatory data sources.

              <p>Data Aggregation and Pre-processing</p>
              <p>• Pg 8 curious to know why data from 2009 to 2016 was used for training and 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2017 was used for testing?</p>

              <p>Additional Editor Comments (if provided):</p>
              <p>Both reviewers raise concerns about the actual contribution of the work and the proper context in which the submission would fit. I invite the authors to proceed to a thorough revision of their work and resubmit it.</p>
              <p>Authors: The contribution of this work is explained in the Motivation in the Introduction Section. The main contributions include: </p>
              <p>(1) The study uses several data sources with high temporal and spatial resolutions that can enhance the accuracy of results. (2) It employs rule-discovery models rather than focusing on predictive regression models commonly used in the relevant existing studies. Rule-discovery models generate patterns that can link the risk of disease presence with subsets of risk factors. (3) It contributes to automation and transparency of predictions. To make it clearer we added the lines below at the end of the second last paragraph in Motivation. Although transparency of predictions is essential in application areas of epidemiology, the transparency of surveillance systems and their outcomes has received less attention in the literature. Since the proposed framework used a collection of rules as a high-level description of data, the explanatory capability of predictions can be enhanced. This means public health officials can find the reasons behind the predictions made by the system.</p>
              <p> (4) The database is a combination of disparate data sources with different scales. We performed a complex transformation on data sources to make them scalable in the defined cells.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The paper treats the problem of training data set to predict virus diffusion and influence with respect to a time windows of several years. The application proposal is reported about data of a secific case, Indonesian data. A framework for data acquisition composed mainly of three modules is reported. Data acquisition, data management (relational db) and data processing and prediction.</p>
              <p>The database is a very simplified relational db where geographic data are managed as numbers. This is a risky simplification for geographic data.</p>
              <p>Authors: Thanks for your helpful comments! </p>
              <p>The database we used is a combination of disparate data sources with different temporal and spatial scales. To the best of our knowledge, previous studies have used single sources of data , combined various analysis methods not data sources, or found the impact of each risk factor on the output separately . We performed a complex transformation on data sources to make them scalable in the defined cells (with specific temporal and spatial resolution). Data transformation has been achieved with extensive feedback from the subject matter experts such as epidemiologists and immunologists. For example, the birdlife-species data consisted a heavy collection of polygons that we simplified and then found out if each cell fall in any polygon area. We selected a spatial resolution of (1-degree) * (1-degree) and a temporal resolution of 1-week to balance between the computational expenses and precision of decision-making. We have examined various methods for transforming this data source and believe that there would be limited variability in geographical data within the specified time and space. </p>
              <p> But beside this, the proposed procedure - to the best of the reviewer's knowledge - is a standard analysis and there is little contribution with respect to prediction tools. Geographic information are used and proposed as guide for managing influenza diffusion.</p>
              <p>Authors: To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to use rule-based methods (Rulefit, FP-Growth and Prefix-span) to extract knowledge from an extensive combination of risk factors for prediction of avian influenza outbreaks. Many spatiotemporal prediction studies are based on regression models and do not consider the interaction between risk factors. Rule-based methods benefit the predictions in two ways: 1) the interactions between risk factors were taken into account. 2) they add transparency to predictions. We believe that transparency of predictions is essential in application areas of epidemiology. Our proposed framework used a collection of rules as a high-level description of data which enhances the explanation capability of predictions. This will be beneficial because public health officials will be able to find the reasons behind the predictions made by the system.</p>
              <p>Case analysis is reported in a too simple if then else structure. Dataset and features selected are not exaclty clear both in the way they are identified as well as the description. Many parts refer to existing tools so it is difficult to gather the right contribution. Also dataset are not available as well as tool. Latter may be useful for a similar application.</p>
              <p>Authors: A complete description of features for each table used in our database is given in the supplementary files. To select data sources and tools for this study, we reviewed the literature and identified data attributes and software tools which best suited our research. We also involved subject matter experts and end-users (e.g. epidemiologists) in different phases of study and attempted trial and errors to select the tools, extract data attributes, and select model/algorithms and their parameters. </p>
              <p>Authors: We will upload the aggregated data with this revision of the manuscript. </p>
              <p>With the pandemia problem, how data and information may be related to virus diffusion may be relevant.</p>
              <p>Authors: In addition to factors such as personal hygiene and airlines, coronavirus can change its transmission behaviour by environmental factors such as humidity, temperature and wind speed (see papers and ). Therefore, the fundamental of this study can be used for the current situation.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for inviting me to review this manuscript describing rule based methodology and its application to avian influenza outbreaks in Indonesia using data on climatic variables, bird species distribution and poultry density. Overall, I think it is an interesting description of the model process but feel that it would benefit the paper if the application of the model itself is promoted rather than its usefulness as a prediction for avian influenza outbreaks.</p>
              <p>Major issues:</p>
              <p>As it stands the paper does not describe ‘risk assessment’ in its traditional sense rather risk factors or risk prediction. For this reason I would suggest changing the title to something like ‘Application of a rule based prediction model for avian influenza outbreaks in Indonesia’. It might be good to include in the future work section an example of where the model could be applied in a situation where the link between risk factors and disease are more evident. For avian influenza this is quite difficult. You quote Loth et al., 2010 who found that “roads” was a significant risk factor. However, looking more in depth he states that it is ‘Possible contaminated transport vehicles return dirty egg-trays back to the farms, increasing the chance of disease spread. Increased movement over longer distances may increase the disease spread even further. This may explain why “roads” was a significant risk factor.’ By using prediction models such as this one the true picture of the relationship between the risk factors can be missed. For this reason I disagree with the statement that it provides a more holistic understanding of the drivers of AI epidemics. It might also be useful to add a paragraph on how to mitigate outbreaks once they have been predicted e.g. if you know an area has high poultry density and the model predicts high risk, how can this be addressed? Would a campaign for better biosecurity in this area help?</p>
              <p>Authors: Thanks for your helpful suggestions! Below find the modifications we made. </p>
              <p>• To address your comment about risk assessment, we changed the title to ‘A Framework for the Risk Prediction of Avian Influenza Occurrence: An Indonesian Case Study’. </p>
              <p>• To address your concern on using of words such as ‘holistic’ or ‘comprehensive’, we replaced them with words such as ‘broad’ or ‘extensive’ throughout the text. </p>
              <p>• We also added the following lines in the conclusion to give an example on how predictions can be used to mitigate outbreaks.</p>
              <p>“An understanding of risk-increasing factors and their interactions and building risk-profiling maps, can be useful in emergency preparedness. For instance, authorities can use such information to prioritize and target areas for interventions.”</p>

              <p>• Throughout the paper please abbreviate avian influenza (AI) when first mentioned and then use abbreviation throughout.</p>
              <p>Authors: We have now used AI instead of Avian influenza after the first time and highlighted throughout the text.</p>
              <p>• Please be consistent with temporal/time or spatial/space</p>
              <p>Authors: We replaced time and space with temporal and spatial and highlighted the changes in the text.</p>
              <p>• How does it take account that there might be a third variable involved e.g. precipitation=standing water=virus survival? See comment above about relationship between risk factors</p>
              <p>Authors: Thanks for this great point. We acknowledge that there may be other variables involved in contributing to the risk factor. However, out study is a proof of concept in which we didn’t consider all possible variables. Furthermore, data availability was a challenge that we had to deal with for this research. In fact, ssome of these data sources that we were hoping to collect for our research were not even accessible. </p>
              <p>Abstract:</p>
              <p>• Suggest change ‘had’ to ‘have’ </p>
              <p>Authors: We change ‘had’ to ‘have’ and highlighted in the text. </p>
              <p>• Suggest change ‘to be transmitted to humans’ to ‘for zoonotic transmission’</p>
              <p>Authors: We changed it as per your recommendation. </p>
              <p>• Have disease prediction systems actually been used in reality to mitigate the consequences of avian influenza?</p>
              <p>Authors: Prediction systems have been used to prioritize the control actions for high risk areas. For example, if bird trade as a high impact as the risk factor of avian influenza, administrators may decide to restrict trades in order to mitigate the spread of the virus. Another example can be about poultry density. if poultry density has a positive association with avian influenza outbreaks, the premises with a high density of poultry would be more at risk and might be vaccinated, for example.</p>
              <p>We added a paragraph in the ‘Conclusions’ to describe how the predictions can help in mitigating the consequences.</p>
              <p>• ‘In this study, we have proposed a framework for the prediction of the occurrence and spread of avian influenza events in a geographical area.’ This doesn’t match up with the title. </p>
              <p>Authors: In fact, we first performed a risk assessment and the then predicted the risk of avian influenza occurrence. To address your comment, we have changed the title to ‘A Framework for the Risk Prediction of Avian Influenza Occurrence: An Indonesian Case Study’.</p>
              <p>• ‘Comprehensive list’ implies you used more than 4 data sources and 8 factors. I’m not sure it is comprehensive</p>
              <p>Authors: We changed it to ‘extensive’ in the abstract, the first paragraph of Motivations and the first paragraph of Conclusions. We also changed the ‘a more holistic understanding’ in the second paragraph of the abstract to ‘a broad understanding’.</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>• Pg 3 Have there been global efforts to eradicate AI? Don’t we just vaccinate humans against influenza annually, so this is control only?</p>
              <p>Authors: Avian influenza is usually controlled by mass vaccination, culling or moving restrictions. Here, by ‘global efforts’ we meant the research works that have been conducted to understand the virus transmission mechanism and seek a solution for its eradication. We changed the global to ‘researchers’ In the text.</p>
              <p>• Pg 3 Suggest change “Had” threatened human lives’ to “has”</p>
              <p>Authors: We changed ‘had’ to ‘has’ and highlighted in the text.</p>
              <p>• Pg 3 ‘To mitigate the impact of avian influenza outbreaks, it is necessary to understand the extent to which different risk factors and their interactions contribute to the introduction and spread of outbreaks.’ Overall I’m not sure how any of the sources have in reality been used to mitigate the impact of RA outbreaks? I think the summary here of the contradiction between studies in the association with risk factors proves how difficult it is or proves that there is perhaps a more complex interaction of factors at play.</p>
              <p>Authors: </p>
              <p>We agree with your statement about inconsistencies of findings in the literature on the association of risk factors. Such inconsistencies may suggest a more complex interaction between the risk factors. We made an attempt to avoid this in our research by utilizing rule-based methods to identify these interactions better. </p>
              <p>In general, the impact of risk factors is used to identify the possible outbreak clusters so that this information can help prioritize and target the areas that control strategies such as vaccination need to be applied.</p>
              <p>• Pg 3 ‘The impact of environmental factors and climate change on the spread and geographical distribution of avian influenza outbreaks has been shown in the literature.’ Not sure this is impact more predictive value</p>
              <p>Authors: We added some references at the end of the sentence ‘The impact of environmental factors and climate change on the spread and geographical distribution of avian influenza outbreaks has been shown in the literature.’ , which have indicated that environmental factors contribute to the spread of the avian influenza. </p>
              <p>• Pg 3 Suggest change ‘well known’ to ‘Documented’</p>
              <p>Authors: Thanks for the suggestion. ‘Well-known’ is changed to ‘documented’ and highlighted in the text.</p>
              <p>• Pg 3 Suggest change ‘contrary’ to ‘contrast’</p>
              <p>Authors: Thanks for bringing this up. This change has been made. </p>
              <p>• Pg 3 ‘is positively connected with H5N1’ suggest insert’ HPAI strain’ before H5N1</p>
              <p>Authors: We added HPAI before H5N1 and highlighted this change in the text.</p>
              <p>• Pg 4 ‘However, Pavade et al. (2011) found connected poultry density to avian influenza outbreaks only for least developed countries that do not have economic growth and financial stability.’ Delete ‘found’. Not sure this is entirely true: is it not more connected to smallholder type farming and poorer between and within farm biosecurity?</p>
              <p>Authors: We removed the sentence from the paper.</p>
              <p>Motivation:</p>
              <p>• Pg 5 ‘Clearly, the system only provides historical information and the temporal resolution is not high enough.’ Not high enough for what?</p>
              <p>Authors: To clarify, ‘the temporal resolution is not high enough’ was changed to ‘the monthly average of climatic variables is a low temporal resolution’</p>
              <p>• Pg 5 The proposed framework was implemented and tested for an Indonesian case study. Indonesia was selected as a case study as this country has had a high number of avian influenza outbreaks over the years and, importantly, it provides accessible explanatory data sources. Delete full stop and words in red. </p>
              <p>Authors: Unfortunately, we were not able to address this comment as we couldn’t find the text that was highlighted in red. </p>
              <p>• Table 1: possible to put website links in?</p>
              <p>Authors: References 39 to 41 are now cited in Table1.</p>
              <p>• Table 2: atmospheric pressure? </p>
              <p>Authors: We used the sea-level air pressure in mbar. Each atm is equal to 1013.25 mbar. </p>

              <p>Data Aggregation and Pre-processing</p>
              <p>• Pg 8 curious to know why data from 2009 to 2016 was used for training and 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2017 was used for testing?</p>
              <p>Authors: There was no difference in the number of instances or distribution of values among years. Initially, we used 2006-2008 for testing and 2009-2016 for training. Later, since we aimed to use the result of test data for a decision support system that combined social media rules with spatiotemporal rules for 2017, we built the spatiotemporal dataset for 2017 as well. </p>
              <p>• Pg 9 (?) should this be (GLW)? </p>
              <p>Authors: That is correct. We changed and highlighted it.</p>
              <p>• Pg 9 why only duck species? </p>
              <p>Authors: Duck species were selected in this study as they are an important group in epidemiology and ecology of avian influenza, they are abundant, and they are migratory. In addition, to reduce variability in the datasets and consistency of our analysis, we considered only duck species as migratory birds.</p>
              <p>• Pg 9 If the model already accounts for temperature, precipitation, humidity etc. why also take account of seasons – wont these implicitly be accounted for using the climatic variables?</p>
              <p>Authors: We think that seasons in Indonesia are not predictable by climatic variables possibly due to global warming. Moreover, usability of the end product (i.e. decision support systems) was another factor to take seasons into account. In other words, seasons would be a more understandable factor for the end-users of a decision support framework.</p>
              <p>• Pg 9 – were any scenario analyses carried out to look at the effect of averaging or repeating the values as described?</p>
              <p>Authors: In this study, in order to aggregate different sources prior to analyses, we divided the Indonesia area to cells with 1*1-degree spatial and 1-week temporal resolution. In order to assign a specific value of each risk factor in each cell, we used averaging and repeating. Basically, if we had multiple values inside a cell (higher resolution than a cell), we averaged the values to come to a single value. In fact, we assume that all points in a cell have similar properties. Conversely, if we had a single value for several cells (lower resolution than a cell), we repeated that value for all cells in that low resolution. Here, we assume that all cells within that resolution have the same properties.</p>
              <p>Data Aggregation:</p>
              <p>Authors: We made an additional change: The sentence ‘This resolution was selected as it offers a good balance between the precision of decision-making and the time required for data processing.’ has been moved from the end of the second paragraph to the first paragraph of ‘Data Aggregation’, which we thought would be a better place for the sentence. We highlighted the change.</p>
              <p>Data Analysis:</p>
              <p>• Pg 11 ‘this is a called a true positive’ delete ‘a’</p>
              <p>Authors: We deleted ‘a’ and highlighted the change.</p>
              <p>Authors: We fixed an additional mistake in the paragraph starting with ‘To address the disparity of explanatory …’. We switched ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ words and highlighted them in the text. </p>
              <p>Authors: We also removed the sentence ‘We denoted the number of positive and negative data points with ‘P’ and ‘N’, respectively.’ From the end of the paragraph starting with ‘In each round, we calculated sensitivity …’. We did not use the ‘P’ and ‘N’ variables in the study. </p>
              <p>Prediction:</p>
              <p>• Pg 13 Suggest change ‘Due to high imbalanced nature of the data set’ to ‘Due to the highly imbalanced nature’</p>
              <p>Authors: We changed the sentence accordingly and highlighted it in the text.</p>
              <p>Results and discussion:</p>
              <p>• Pg 16 delete ‘as well’ after Belkhiria et al., 2018)</p>
              <p>Authors: We deleted ‘as well’. Thanks. </p>
              <p>Conclusion and future work:</p>
              <p>• ‘comprehensive list’ – same comment as before</p>
              <p>Authors: We changed it to ‘extensive’ in abstract, the first paragraph of Motivations and the first paragraph of Conclusions.</p>
              <p>• In the methodology section it states: ‘In the last step (Prediction), end-users can communicate with the system through a user interface. Here, the user interface can include mapping and monitoring of the risk, given a current spatio-temporal dataset.’ Where is the link to the user interface? Have any maps been generated from this work?</p>
              <p>Authors: The results from this work in conjunction with a social media disease surveillance study was used to build a decision support system in a subsequent study that recently was accepted to be published. In the above-mentioned study, we explained how the user interact with the system and risk maps are generated. </p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Even if authors answered to revision issues, my personal problem with this work is still related to the partially addressed evidence and focus on geographic data aspects. The answer to revision is indeed not so clear with respect to the reviewer invitation on GIS related aspects (i.e. lat and long information at the first revision step). Spatial modules and images are strictly related to epidemiology performance and analysis. Thus, even if authors addressed the reviewer comments they did not mentioned the technical aspects related to mapping gathered data in a native spatial system. Now, if this is not an issue that should be deeply treated, it is necessary in case of: (i) integration of different sources and (ii) in case of reuse of the proposed method for different cases. How data has been mapped into commonly used and structured geographic model, is still not clear. Performing interesting queries as well as epidemiological analysis is what reader should expect from this paper starting from examples, title and abstract. On the other hand, if the proposal is finalized as a presentation of a use case my suggestion is to improve the data structure representation as minor revision to allow readers in gathering the contribution as a well structured example. I thus suggest to review the methodology to enrich possibility of replicating on different data samples.</p>

              <p>Title: A Framework for Risk Assessment of Avian Influenza Occurrence: An Indonesian Case Study</p>
              <p>Authors: Samira YousefiNaghani, Rozita Dara, Zvonimir Poljak, Fei Song, and Shayan Sharif</p>
              <p>Manuscript No: PONE-D-20-03935R1</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Alessandro Rizzo</p>
              <p>We are very grateful to Academic Editor and the reviewers for the second review and comments regarding the Manuscript ID PONE-D-20-03935R1 entitled "A Framework for Risk Assessment of Avian Influenza Occurrence: An Indonesian Case Study". </p>
              <p>We have addressed the comments and made the required changes which we believe have improved the manuscript in a way that is now acceptable for publication in PLOS ONE journal. In the following, we will describe our responses to the points made by academic editor and reviewers. Given comments have been copied and are followed by specific responses in green. </p>
              <p>Academic Editor Comments:</p>
              <p>• One of the two reviewers is satisfied with your revision. Another reviewer, on the other hand, deems the technical content as adequate, but requires you to clarify some aspects with respect to data treatment. I concur with the reviewer that such clarifications will contribute to make the paper more readable and to significantly increase its visibility and impact. </p>
              <p>Authors:</p>
              <p>• We added a paragraph in the Methodology section to add more clarity on data aggregation. The paragraph is highlighted in the manuscript. For the purpose of reusability, we can provide the data to be publicly available for readers.</p>
              <p>• While revising your submission, please upload your figure files to the Preflight Analysis and Conversion Engine (PACE) digital diagnostic tool, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/">https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/</ext-link>.

              <p>Authors:</p>
              <p>• We uploaded the EPS figures on PACE tool. These figures have been adjusted and generated TIFFs figures. We will be submitting TIFF figures along with the revised manuscript. </p>
              <p>• In addition, we renamed the figures to their associated caption names. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1 comments:</p>
              <p>• Even if authors answered to revision issues, my personal problem with this work is still related to the partially addressed evidence and focus on geographic data aspects. The answer to revision is indeed not so clear with respect to the reviewer invitation on GIS related aspects (i.e. lat and long information at the first revision step). Spatial modules and images are strictly related to epidemiology performance and analysis. Thus, even if authors addressed the reviewer comments they did not mentioned the technical aspects related to mapping gathered data in a native spatial system. Now, if this is not an issue that should be deeply treated, it is necessary in case of: (i) integration of different sources and (ii) in case of reuse of the proposed method for different cases. How data has been mapped into commonly used and structured geographic model, is still not clear. Performing interesting queries as well as epidemiological analysis is what reader should expect from this paper starting from examples, title and abstract. On the other hand, if the proposal is finalized as a presentation of a use case my suggestion is to improve the data structure representation as minor revision to allow readers in gathering the contribution as a well structured example. I thus suggest to review the methodology to enrich possibility of replicating on different data samples.</p>
              <p>Authors:</p>
              <p>• Thanks for your helpful suggestion. On page 6, in the Methodology Section and after Fig 3, we added a paragraph explaining how the relational dataset was used as a geographical model which can be visualized in a GIS system. We added the paragraph below:</p>
              <p>``The data aggregation was performed in a Structured Query Language table. The response variable describes a disease event that occurred within a certain time interval (week number t) and a spatial compartment with a center of (x,y), where x represents longitude and y represents latitude. The spatiotemporal information in ``Indonesia" data tables in Fig 2 are demonstrated by ``week", ``cell_longitude" and ``cell_latitude" attributes. Similarly, for other covariates, pre-processing techniques were applied to transform the records into the defined grid-based table. Since the table included coordinate information for each record, a weekly timeline of information could be visualized in maps using GIS software. Moreover, extracted patterns from the grid-based data could be simple and easy to understand.”</p>

              <p>**********</p>
              <p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: No</p>
              <p>**********</p>
