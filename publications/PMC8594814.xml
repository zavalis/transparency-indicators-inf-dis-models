              <abstract>
                <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 and by November 14, 2020 there were 53.3M confirmed cases and 1.3M reported deaths in the world. In the same period, Ethiopia reported 102K cases and 1.5K deaths. Effective public health preparedness and response to COVID-19 requires timely projections of the time and size of the peak of the outbreak. Currently, Ethiopia under the COVAX facility has begun vaccinating high risk populations but due to vaccine supply shortages and the absence of an effective treatment, the implementation of NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions), like hand washing, wearing face coverings or social distancing, still remain the most effective methods of controlling the pandemic as recommended by WHO. This study proposes a modified Susceptible Exposed Infected and Recovered (SEIR) model to predict the number of COVID-19 cases at different stages of the disease under the implementation of NPIs at different adherence levels in both urban and rural settings of Ethiopia. To estimate the number of cases and their peak time, 30 different scenarios were simulated. The results indicated that the peak time of the pandemic is different in urban and rural populations of Ethiopia. In the urban population, under moderate implementation of three NPIs the pandemic will be expected to reach its peak in December, 2020 with 147,972 cases, of which 18,100 are symptomatic and 957 will require admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Among the implemented NPIs, increasing the coverage of wearing masks by 10% could reduce the number of new cases on average by one-fifth in urban-populations. Varying the coverage of wearing masks in rural populations minimally reduces the number of cases. In conclusion, the models indicate that the projected number of hospital cases during the peak time is higher than the Ethiopian health system capacity. To contain symptomatic and ICU cases within the health system capacity, the government should pay attention to the strict implementation of the existing NPIs or impose additional public health measures.</p>

              <title>1 Introduction</title>
              <p>The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The associated disease, COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on March 11, 2020. By November 14, 2020 over 53.5 million confirmed cases and 1.3 million deaths had been reported across the world [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In Africa, the burden and impacts of the pandemic are less compared with Europe and the USA. This may be attributed to the later arrival of the pandemic, low seeding rate, youthful demographics and possible prior immunity to coronavirus-like infections [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, the pandemic is accelerating in Africa and passed 2.0 million confirmed cases on November 13, 2020 according to the [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] situation report. In Ethiopia, the first imported COVID-19 case was detected on March 13, 2020 by the Ministry of Health in a Japanese traveller from Burkina Faso [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>To control the spread of the disease, the Ethiopian government took immediate action, by closing schools, and banning sporting events and mass gatherings. It took 79 days to reach the first 1000 cases, but 10,000, 20,000, 40,000 and 80,000 cases were attained in shorter periods of 51, 16, 18 and 44 days respectively. By the middle of November, 2020 the cases had surpassed 100,000.</p>
              <p>As the pandemic accelerates globally, many African countries, including Ethiopia, have been implementing different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain the spread of the disease. The WHO is leading a global COVAX initiative for accelerated development of promising vaccine candidates that may be available in early 2021, and experimental therapies are also undergoing clinical trials for safety before licensing. Currently,the most effective means to control the spread of COVID-19 remains the implementation of different NPIs to break chains of transmission [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The transmission pathways of COVID-19 from person to person are: i) close contact through respiratory droplets, ii) direct contact with infected persons, and iii) contact with contaminated fomites (objects and surfaces) [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Public health measures are intended to diminish these transmission mechanisms.</p>
              <p>Mathematical models have been previously used with greater success in understanding the transmission dynamics and control mechanisms of infectious diseases [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To understand the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19 under different scenarios, a number of mathematical models have been previously proposed [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These established epidemiological and mathematical models provide important insights for public health decision-makers to enforce different mitigation strategies in different countries. As COVID-19 continues to spread worldwide, most public health authorities are utilizing mathematical models for decision making on intervention guidelines. Many countries (for example the UK, China, Germany, USA, Morocco) revised their public health measures based on COVID-19 model predictions. We believe that, due to the differences in social interaction and life style of the urban and rural populations in Ethiopia, mathematical models developed in other countries may be inapplicable in unraveling the dynamics of disease in lower income settings. This study employs the use of mathematical models to simulate the spread and interruption of transmission of COVID-19 in Ethiopia.</p>
              <p>Assessment of the effectiveness of the implemented and proposed intervention strategies for combating COVID-19 by predicting the number of new cases and deaths is a major challenge to the scientific community. [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259874.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] estimated the impact of NPIs based on confirmed cases of COVID-19 in several countries. Similarly, [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] studied the impact of NPIs to reduce COVID-19 mortality and health care demand. To our knowledge, there has been very limited study of the impact of NPIs on the disease dynamics in the local context of Ethiopia. The only published study, by [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], focused on small, medium and large clusters of the population with social distancing, face masking and contact tracing implementation at different proportions. This study did not quantify the impact of hand washing measures on transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the study did not provide the estimated number of cases under different stages of the disease. [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] implements Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling to project COVID-19 prevalence patterns in East African countries, mainly Ethiopia, Djibouti, Sudan and Somalia. However, the ARIMA model did not take into account the impact of NPIs with different adherence levels on the predicted number of cases.</p>
              <p>Our study proposes a modified mathematical form of the classic SEIR model [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and this modified model is used to compare the effect of different NPIs individually and in combination to mitigate COVID-19 in Ethiopia. This proposed model (<xref rid="pone.0259874.e001" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>) has several advantages over previous works: i) it estimates time and size of the peak under the implementation of NPIs with different adherence levels in urban and rural population settings, ii) it differentiates asymptomatic and symptomatic infections which influences the number of ICU cases and deaths due to the disease, iii)it accounts for the effect of indirect transmission of the disease through contaminated environment, and iv) it provides the estimated impact of individual and combined public health measures on the dynamics of the disease.</p>

                <p>In our modeling framework (<xref rid="pone.0259874.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), the population is divided into different compartments according to the infection status of individuals: susceptible (S), exposed (E), asymptomatic infected (<italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub>), symptomatic infected (<italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">s</italic></sub>), isolated at home or hospital with moderate health condition (<italic toggle="yes">H</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>), hospitalized with severe health condition (<italic toggle="yes">H</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">c</italic></sub>), recovered from the disease (R), and death (D) due to the disease. Contaminated environment is also a means of transmission for COVID-19 as the virus can stay up to several days on different surfaces [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To account for the impact of contaminated objects in virus transmission, an additional compartment for contaminated environment is included. Parameter descriptions are presented in <xref rid="pone.0259874.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Assumed initial values were extracted from a number of key papers and reports of the situation in Ethiopia [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259874.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259874.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] as well as known epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19.</p>

                <title>2.2 Projection of cases using the proposed model</title>
                <p>The proposed modified SEIR model described in Section 2.1 is used to project the number of COVID-19 cases in Ethiopia. Projecting the number of active COVID-19 cases under the implementation of different NPIs with different adherence levels is important for policy makers to be able to mitigate against the disease. Projecting the number of asymptomatic and symptomatic people is important, as these have significant implications in the spread of the disease. Furthermore, knowing the expected number of people who may require treatment under intensive care (ICU cases) will greatly help to guide policy makers in optimizing the preparedness of healthcare workers and medical facilities. Due to the very limited number of available ventilators in Ethiopia (fewer than 1000 countrywide), it is important to estimate the number of severe cases that will require ICU hospitalization.</p>
                <p>Based on the 2016 Ethiopian demographic and health survey, 27.4% and 7.8% of the urban and rural population wash hands using soap, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, in the simulation, we assumed improved percentages of hygiene due to the awareness created by COVID-19 in both population settings. Due to differences in access to sanitation materials, lifestyle, cultural norms and other factors, adherence levels to the recommended NPIs are also different in the urban and rural populations. As a result, projection on the number of COVID-19 related cases is done separately for urban and rural populations of Ethiopia.</p>

                <p>In the rural parts of Ethiopia, physical distancing is a custom that is widely practiced. It greatly minimizes the spread of contagious diseases or those caused by contamination of the environment. Furthermore, due to low coverage of road accessibility (accessibility index = 22%), in our simulation we assumed 20% of the population did not travel frequently and therefore may be shielded from the high risk hence minimizing interactions or contact until the end of the pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. <xref rid="pone.0259874.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> presents a summary of adherence levels used in the numerical simulation study.

                <p>At 15% face mask coverage and with 10% of the population implementing social distancing measures, a 10% increase in hygiene will decrease the number of cases by 200,000 and delay the peak time approximately by 55 days. For a given implementation of wearing a face mask and hygiene, improving the percentage of social distancing by 10% will reduce the number of new COVID-19 cases by one-fifth. Increasing the number of people who wear face masks by 10% will prevent on average 25,000 people from being infected by the disease (<xref rid="pone.0259874.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

Implementing hygiene measures, physical distancing, and wearing face masks at 20%, 40%, and 5%, respectively, could shift the peak time to 2021. The projected number of active cases during the peak time could reach around 360,000 if 5%, 40%, and 20% of the population wear masks, keep physical distancing and hand wash with soap, respectively. As social distancing is already a custom due to the life style in the rural population of Ethiopia, improving hygiene by 20% could help to decrease the number of cases by 2–3 fold.</p>

                <p>For a given coverage of face mask wearing and implementing physical distancing, improving hygiene by 10%, greatly reduces the number of active cases and delays the peak time of the pandemic. For both hygiene scenarios, for a given level of face mask wearing, increasing adherence to physical distancing profoundly reduces the number of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. A maximum number of asymptomatic infections will be observed if there is poor implementation of physical distancing and face mask wearing. Regardless of other NPIs, COVID-19 will be suppressed if 40% of the population implements physical distancing properly.</p>

                <p>If 15% of the population wears masks and 30% implement physical distancing, improving hygiene by 10% could reduce the number of ICU cases from 463 to 280 (<xref rid="pone.0259874.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Proper implementation of wearing face masks and hand washing could flatten the curve. However, to bring critical cases within the Ethiopian health care system, people should also practice social distancing. To completely suppress the spread of the disease in all urban populations of Ethiopia, there has to be strict implementation of NPIs, where 40% have to practice hand washing, 40% physical distancing and 25% wearing masks.</p>
                <p>In the rural population the projected number of critical cases could exceed the available number of ventilators in the Ethiopian healthcare system (<xref rid="pone.0259874.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Since the time of the peak in rural populations is different from that of urban populations, the healthcare system can make preparations for the transport system to bring these critical cases to heath facilities in urban centers. The two extreme scenarios show that improving hygiene by 5% and physical distancing by 40% could reduce the number of critical cases from 2,361 to 1,569 (assuming 5% wear masks) at peak time. Strict implementation of the three NPIs will shift the peak time forward by three months (<xref rid="pone.0259874.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

                <p><xref rid="pone.0259874.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref> shows that the model is particularly sensitive to social distancing (SD), hand washing (HW) and the direct human to human (H2H) disease transmission rate (<italic toggle="yes">β</italic><sub>1</sub>). Hand washing and social/physical distancing were inversely proportional to <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">o</italic></sub>, while <italic toggle="yes">β</italic><sub>1</sub> was directly proportional to <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">o</italic></sub>.</p>

                <p>Parameters with relatively large Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) values (&gt;0.5 or &lt; − 0.5) as well as corresponding small p values (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) are considered to have the most significant influence on outcome of disease. Parameters whose PRCC value are close to + 1 or −1 most strongly influence the model. A negative sign for PRCC indicates an inverse relationship of the parameter with <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">o</italic></sub>.</p>
                <p>To explore the interdependence of parameters, pairwise comparisons were carried out. The processes underlying physical distancing, hand washing and the proportion of the population who become symptomatic, <italic toggle="yes">θ</italic>, have the greatest potential of containing the epidemic if increased, whereas processes described by <italic toggle="yes">β</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">η</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sub> have the greatest potential of making the epidemic worse when increased (<xref rid="pone.0259874.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>).</p>
                <p>In this respect, increasing physical distancing directly reduces <italic toggle="yes">β</italic><sub>1</sub> as this lowers the likelihood of a susceptible individual making contact with a potentially infectious individual. In addition, practicing good hygiene (such as regularly washing hands, using sanitizers to disinfect the infected environment, ventilation of rooms and avoiding touching the T-zones of the face) is associated with lowering the chance of contracting the virus from contaminated surfaces. Anything contrary to the above increases the likelihood of getting the infection through the two aforementioned routes. Moreover, improving hand washing practices will reduce viral contamination of the environment by infected individuals.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the processes underlying the parameters with negative PRCC have a potential to contain the number of cases when enhanced.</p>
                <p>To ascertain whether the process described by those parameters are different or not, a pairwise comparison to significant parameters was undertaken. <xref rid="pone.0259874.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> presents the computed p-values for different pairs of significant parameters by accounting for the false discovery rate (FDR). The major question posed at this point is: are the pairs of significant parameters different after FDR adjustment? Based on the FDR adjusted p-values in <xref rid="pone.0259874.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>, the compared pairs of parameters are found to be different if their p-value is less than 0.05 and not different otherwise.</p>

                <p>Further, to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we consider the actual reported cases in the month of October as a validation data set.

The projected and observed cases are shown in <xref rid="pone.0259874.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>. The projected cases are very close to those observed, and there is a similar slope, indicating that our model is successfully capturing the dynamics of Covid-19 in Ethiopia. The projected number of cases (red line) by the proposed model are a bit higher than the actual cases (<xref rid="pone.0259874.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>). This may be due to under reported cases because of very low test coverage in Ethiopia. Further, the difference between the actual reported number of cases and projected cases ranges from 2053 to 6946 individuals which is an acceptable prediction error in a country with a large population (above 110 million in the case of Ethiopia).</p>

              <title>4 Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, a modified SEIR model was developed to project the number of COVID-19 cases with different stages of the disease under the implementation of wearing face masks, hand washing and physical distancing with varying adherence levels in both urban and rural populations of Ethiopia. Unlike other mathematical modeling studies done in the context of Ethiopia [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259874.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259874.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], this study provides projected numbers of all active cases, symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and ICU cases at the peak time of the pandemic. The projected number of people in each stage of the disease at the peak period and the time of the peak in urban and rural areas of Ethiopia helps the government to choose and enforce better intervention mechanisms.</p>
              <p>Our projection shows that, in line with [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259874.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] improving the percentage of the population who wear face masks by 10% will protect around 100,000 more people from being infected by COVID-19 in the urban population. Regardless of face mask coverage and hygiene, the peak time of COVID-19 could be shifted to the future by two months if 40% of the population implements social distancing properly. Similar to our findings, the study by [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] demonstrated practicing physical distancing and wearing face masks delayed the peak time of the pandemic. [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] estimated the COVID-19 case burden for all African countries under different intervention scenarios (no intervention, moderate lock-down and hard lock-down) using a compartmental model. [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] studies the impacts of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 in South Africa using a mathematical model and additionally, proper implementation of physical distancing greatly reduced the basic reproduction number.</p>
              <p>In the urban population setting, if 20% of the population implements physical distancing and 30% adopt hygiene measures, and 25% wear face masks the peak time of the pandemic will happen in December, 2020 with 119,000 estimated cases (<xref rid="pone.0259874.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). During the peak time of the pandemic, except for some scenarios (30% physical distancing and above ≥15% face mask coverage), the projected number of ICU cases is above the capacity of the Ethiopian health system, an issue which therefore needs government attention (<xref rid="pone.0259874.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>).</p>
              <p>COVID-19 is a deadly virus that recent global efforts have led to a breakthrough in development of a number of effective vaccines being made available under the COVAX facility. Specific medical treatment is not yet available but supportive, therefore is highly recommended. Hence the government should focus on prevention of infection using NPI mechanisms. Low socioeconomic status and behavioral attitudes lead to closer interactions in congested households, hampering the successful implementation of social distancing measures. Lack or improper use of masks and use of low quality masks may exacerbate the spread of infection [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It is therefore imperative that the prudent use of NPIs is implemented in Ethiopia to contain the pandemic. NPIs used in combination are able to decrease cases and fatalities due to Covid-19. Separate implementation of each of the NPIs shortens the peak time of the pandemic and the number of new cases will increase by two-fold. We considered the place of residence being urban and rural as a factor since adherence to the recommended NPIs and the life style and living conditions, varies greatly between urban and rural populations of Ethiopia [<xref rid="pone.0259874.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Similar to the urban population projection, projection of cases in the rural setting was done by modifying the model parameters in the context of rural population practices. <xref rid="pone.0259874.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> presents a summary of projected active COVID-19 cases and ICU cases in rural population of Ethiopia under 30 scenarios. The results shows that, at the peak of the pandemic, the number of projected cases in rural population will be higher than the urban population.</p>
              <p>A better understanding of the impact of NPIs on COVID-19 transmission dynamics could help to control the spread of the disease. In future we suggest that extending the proposed approach by taking into account the age structure of the population and considering a stochastic modeling framework may lead to a more precise projection on the number of COVID-19 cases. Further, implementing the presented approach to other countries in the region will be helpful to provide insightful recommendations on the implementation of different NPIs to mitigate COVID-19 in the Horn of Africa.</p>

              <title>5 Conclusion</title>
              <p>The first COVID-19 case was detected on March 13, 2020 and since then the government of Ethiopia has applied different mitigation strategies. But the virus continues to spread. Since community transmission of the virus is established, temporary relaxation of any of the three non-pharmaceutical interventions could cause a rebound of the number of new cases, potentially leading to a collapse of the health care system. Our findings confirm, in the context of Ethiopia, that suppression of COVID-19 could be achieved by the combined implementation of three public health measures: wearing of face masks, social distancing and hygiene. The most effective public health measures are face mask wearing in urban populations and social distancing in rural populations. In addition, the successful enforcement of all these public health measures and guidelines by the government requires adherence by the public. Based on the projected results under different scenarios, concerned health stakeholders could recommend feasible and cost effective NPIs to policy makers for implementation.</p>

              <title>6 Limitations</title>
              <p>Studies on COVID-19 showed the distribution of cases strongly depended on age. We could not segregate our analysis into age-structured predictions or assess the impact of school closure on the pandemic due to lack of reliable resources. Further, the projection to the rural population setting is less reliable as the analysis has been constrained by different factors (i.e. the breakdown of case in rural settings was not known with precision, adherence to the implemented NPIs vary greatly across different regions of the country, estimated number of protected individuals assumed 20%, and others). In addition to this, the testing rate of COVID-19 is very low in Ethiopia which may lead underestimation of the actual case number. This study did not account for under reporting of COVID-19 cases.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This paper presents a mathematical model and analysis to investigate the impact of alternative non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) on the spread of COVID in Ethiopia. It builds upon a standard epidemiological model (SEIR) and adds components for symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals, and hospitalized individuals. It also adds a component for transmission from the environment. The model considers the impacts of NPI by essentially decreasing the transmission rates between model components. The model has 9 state variables covered by a standard system of ODEs with 22 parameters with values estimated from the limited data available or assumed. The model is used to project the dynamics of the state variables under several NPI scenarios separately for the urban and rural populations of Ethiopia.</p>
              <p>The assessment of this paper would have been enhanced if the following issues had been addressed.</p>
              <p>1. The introduction says "We believe that, due to the difference in the age-structure of the population, social interaction and life style in Ethiopia, mathematical models developed in other countries may not work to study the dynamics of disease in lower income settings." Given the tremendous number of COVID models already developed, this statement requires justification, particularly because the model they use has nothing at all about age-structure and the manner in which the differences in life style and social interactions are included in the model would be readily accounted for in standard SEIR models by simple modifications of the parameter values.</p>
              <p>2. The model consists of two non-linear ODEs in a standard epidemiological format, linked to a linear system of ODEs for all the other 7 state variables. The system is therefore essentially equivalent in terms of long-term dynamics to a system of three equations and standard general theory of ODEs can be applied to show the resmdeified - the paper ults of Theorem 2.1 that is proved in the appendix, as well as the other two Theorems (indeed the authors refer to a previous paper for the proof if Theorem 2.2 and say nothing at all about Theorem 2.3 except state it. Thus the paper can be greatly reduced in length by referring to general ODE results.</p>
              <p>3. There is no mention of evaluation nor is there any attempt to evaluate the model. With no criteria provided to state whether the model is appropriate, it s not clear that the projection they produce are at all meaningful. At the least, I would expect some parameterization be chosen and compared to the available data for a portion of the time series of at a and then use to project for the later part of the time series with some criteria applied to infer the model is reasonable. As it stands the implication from Table 4 is that the core dynamics of the infection was changing rapidly over the course of the year so that it is far from clear that the model assumptions fo constant parameter values is reasonable.</p>
              <p>4. The paper is missing key descriptions that would be required to allow repeatability of the results stated. It is really not at all clear how the many parameters were estimated. For example the virus decay rate is stated as 1/4 with no source except "average" and many of the sources of the parameters are "assumed". Similarly the assumed differences between the urban and rural populations are assumed to be very specific values (27.4% and 7.8% of the urban and rural populations wash their hands) with little assessment that these could be tremendously off. There is no code listed or methods describe for the dynamic solutions of the systems of equations in the model -m presumably they are using some standard ODE solver but they do not say.</p>
              <p>5. There is no discussion of data quality in the data sets on the disease progression, and in fact it isn't clear how these data sets were utilized in the model analysis. Given the variety of concerns about reporting inadequacies n many countries, some discussion of the implications of poor data should be included.</p>
              <p>6. The main results in Fg 10 on the sensitivity analysis are completely obvious from the formula for R0 given that R0 has a factor of r4 which has symmetric negative dependence on SD, c FM and HW. Similarly the dependence on Beta1 enters because Beta1is a factor in the two terms of the R0.</p>
              <p>7. Major portion of the manuscript is in Figures 2-9 which illustrate the dynamics of the model for the rural or urban population under a limited set of scenarios for NPI but there is no justification given for the scenarios chosen so the reader has no way of asserting that these are scenarios which are indeed more meaningful than the many other ones that are possible.</p>
              <p>8. There are many, many places where the grammar and sentence structure needs to be modified. Similarly many of the references are not in appropriate style. Figure 1 is confusing - some dashed lines have arrows and others do not and it isn't clear why some are dashed and some are not based on the equations - the Env equation has a dashed line from S for some reason. The notation for the state variable I Hm is confusing since it seems to be two variables.</p>
              <p>9. The authors assume that there is no movement of individuals at all between the urban and rural populations. This justifies their efforts to look at the NPI in the two separately. However this assumption needs to be justified.</p>

              <p>Reviewers' comments:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: </p>
              <p>This paper presents a mathematical model and analysis to investigate the impact of alternative non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) on the spread of COVID in Ethiopia. It builds upon a standard epidemiological model (SEIR) and adds components for symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals, and hospitalized individuals. It also adds a component for transmission from the environment. The model considers the impacts of NPI by essentially decreasing the transmission rates between model components. The model has 9 state variables covered by a standard system of ODEs with 22 parameters with values estimated from the limited data available or assumed. The model is used to project the dynamics of the state variables under several NPI scenarios separately for the urban and rural populations of Ethiopia.</p>
              <p>The assessment of this paper would have been enhanced if the following issues had been addressed.</p>
              <p>1. The introduction says "We believe that, due to the difference in the age structure of the population, social interaction and lifestyle in Ethiopia, mathematical models developed in other countries may not work to study the dynamics of disease in lower-income settings." Given the tremendous number of COVID models already developed, this statement requires justification, particularly because the model they use has nothing at all about age-structure and the manner in which the differences in lifestyle and social interactions are included in the model would be readily accounted for in standard SEIR models by simple modifications of the parameter values.</p>
              <p>- We thankfully accept the comment about the age-structure. Initially, we assumed we would get data stratified by age. In the meantime, it was difficult to find such data, and in the revised version we amended the text accordingly. Regarding the lifestyle, urban and rural population differs in a number of ways. Such as, in rural areas, people live in a more scattered way than the urban, and the way they greet when they meet each other is also different (i.e. in rural areas there is no custom of handshaking). Further, the attention they give to hygiene is another source of differences considered in the paper. </p>
              <p>2. The model consists of two non-linear ODEs in a standard epidemiological format, linked to a linear system of ODEs for all the other 7 state variables. The system is therefore essentially equivalent in terms of long-term dynamics to a system of three equations and standard general theory of ODEs can be applied to show the resmdeified - the paper ults of Theorem 2.1 that is proved in the appendix, as well as the other two Theorems (indeed the authors refer to a previous paper for the proof if Theorem 2.2 and say nothing at all about Theorem 2.3 except state it. Thus the paper can be greatly reduced in length by referring to general ODE results.</p>
              <p>- We thankfully accept the comment. Details on the mathematical model system equilibria, stability of the system, sensitivity analyses, and well-posedness of the proposed mathematical model were provided as supplementary material of the revised version.</p>
              <p>3. There is no mention of evaluation nor is there any attempt to evaluate the model. With no criteria provided to state whether the model is appropriate, it’s not clear that the projection they produce are at all meaningful. At the least, I would expect some parameterization to be chosen and compared to the available data for a portion of the time series of at a and then use to project for the later part of the time series with some criteria applied to infer the model is reasonable. As it stands the implication from Table 4 is that the core dynamics of the infection was changing rapidly over the course of the year so that it is far from clear that the model assumptions of constant parameter values is reasonable.</p>
              <p>- We thankfully accept the comment. Because of little surveillance testing for COVID-19 in Ethiopia, it is difficult to get suitable data for model validation. Our aim in this study was to project the course of the disease in Ethiopia at a point in time depending on different adherence levels of NPIs. Due to the limited availability of data in Ethiopia we have used values from the literature to parameterize our model. However to assess the importance of considered parameters in the considered model, we have performed a sensitivity analysis by computing partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCC). Further, to see whether one parameter depends on another, pair wise comparisons were carried out.</p>
              <p>- The difference in Ro (presented in Table 4) over the course of the dynamics is due to the intervention enforced by the government. Our model is helpful in indicating trends for projected cases depending on different levels of NPIs implementation.</p>
              <p>4. The paper is missing key descriptions that would be required to allow repeatability of the results stated. It is really not at all clear how many parameters were estimated. For example, the virus decay rate is stated as 1/4 with no source except "average" and many of the sources of the parameters are "assumed". Similarly, the assumed differences between the urban and rural populations are assumed to be very specific values (27.4% and 7.8% of the urban and rural populations wash their hands) with little assessment that these could be tremendously off. There is no code listed or methods described for the dynamic solutions of the systems of equations in the model -m presumably they are using some standard ODE solver but they do not say.</p>
              <p>- We thankfully accept the comment and in the revised version, sources were explicitly mentioned (Table 1, last column), and additional references were included in the reference list. </p>
              <p>- A number of factors (temperatures, relative humidity, and UV Index) influence the COVID-19 virus decay rate and we consider the average. In the revised manuscript references were given.</p>
              <p>- The assumed difference between the urban and rural populations (27.4% and 7.8% of the urban and rural populations wash their hands) is evidence based as revealed by the 2016 Ethiopian demographic and health survey. Reference sources included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
              <p>- For repeatability of the results, matlab codes used to generate the results in the manuscript and now included in the supplementary material.</p>
              <p>5. There is no discussion of data quality in the data sets on the disease progression, and in fact it isn't clear how these data sets were utilized in the model analysis. Given the variety of concerns about reporting inadequacies in many countries, some discussion of the implications of poor data should be included.</p>
              <p>- We have used publicly available data (i.e. daily number of new cases, deaths) and some variables (i.e. daily number of ICU cases) extracted from ministry of health and Ethiopian public health institute reports. The testing rate is indeed quite low in Ethiopia compared to other countries, however given the fact that the number of cases is only uses as indicative trend prior to our projection, this has little consequences on our model projections</p>
              <p>- We mentioned the impact of poor data on the “Limitation” subsection of the manuscript. The testing rate of COVID-19 is very low in Ethiopia which may lead the number reported of cases is underestimated.</p>
              <p>6. The main results in Fg 10 on the sensitivity analysis are completely obvious from the formula for R0 given that R0 has a factor of r4 which has symmetric negative dependence on SD, c FM and HW. Similarly, the dependence on Beta1 enters because Beta1is a factor in the two terms of the R0.</p>
              <p>- Yes that is true. But, for the general audience, the equation for Ro is not obvious. Further, the sensitivity analysis graph is a better visualization guide for future efforts to better describe the impact of hygiene, social distancing and wearing facemask. In addition to this, this section also tries to investigate whether one parameter depends on another using a pair wise comparison test. </p>
              <p>7. Major portion of the manuscript is in Figures 2-9 which illustrate the dynamics of the model for the rural or urban population under a limited set of scenarios for NPI but there is no justification given for the scenarios chosen so the reader has no way of asserting that these are scenarios which are indeed more meaningful than the many other ones that are possible.</p>
              <p>- We thankfully accept the comment, and in the revised manuscript, the reason for considering those scenarios was given in the revised method Section 2.3 as follow. “These values were selected based on expert opinion of how the dynamics may look under the implementation of NPIs with different adherence levels in the urban and rural populations. Further, the considered NPI’s coverage is supported by phone-based survey results. (Baye 2020, Kebede et al 2020).”</p>
              <p>8. There are many, many places where the grammar and sentence structure needs to be modified. Similarly, many of the references are not inappropriate style. Figure 1 is confusing - some dashed lines have arrows and others do not and it isn't clear why some are dashed and some are not based on the equations - the Env equation has a dashed line from S for some reason. The notation for the state variable IHm is confusing since it seems to be two variable</p>
              <p>- Flow diagram of the mathematical model showing the transition of individuals in different compartments based on infectious status (solid lines). The model also includes the environment, which receives infection from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals and from which infection can pass to susceptible individuals (dashed lines), at a rate dependent on the force of infection.</p>
              <p>- To avoid confusing, the state variable IHm changed to Hm.</p>
              <p>9. The authors assume that there is no movement of individuals at all between the urban and rural populations. This justifies their efforts to look at the NPI in the two separately. However, this assumption needs to be justified.</p>
              <p>- Your concern in this respect is valid. We draw this assumption due to the fact that there was very low road accessibility to connect the urban and rural population of Ethiopia (World-Bank (2016). Measuring Rural Access).</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors have added a supplementary information component to this paper that improves the clarity of the mathematical results.</p>
              <p>The manuscript does not state what numerical method they are using in the Matlab code - it appears they are using the Euler method and some justification why a more standard ODE solver within Matlab is not provided. Some justification for the numerical stability of the Euler method they implement is needed since there are many reasons why this method is replaced by others.

              <p>In response to review comment #3 the authors state that the results in Table 4 arose from different "interventions enforced by the government" over the time period modeled.

It appears Table 4 gives model results assumed to be from the interventions and adherence levels given in Table 2, but there is no mention of the timing of these interventions.

              <p>Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors have added a supplementary information component to this paper that improves the clarity of the mathematical results.</p>
              <p>The manuscript does not state what numerical method they are using in the Matlab code - it appears they are using the Euler method and some justification why a more standard ODE solver within Matlab is not provided. Some justification for the numerical stability of the Euler method they implement is needed since there are many reasons why this method is replaced by others. Some of the rate parameters in the model are one or two orders of magnitude different from other rate parameters, which implies the potential for stiffness, which is one of the conditions under which the Euler method is unstable numerically.</p>
              <p>- There are several methods for solving ODEs. We prefer to use Euler because Euler method is used in solving differential equations with known initial conditions. Further this method also used to approximate the behavior of the equations involved in a certain range. To increase the accuracy of the method we used a time step of 0.01.</p>
              <p> In response to comments regarding model evaluation (review comment #3), the authors still make no attempt to compare the model results with data. They state that the sensitivity analysis provides insight into the importance of model parameters, which it does, but sensitivity analysis provides no evidence in and of itself that the model assumptions and results appropriately describe the dynamics of the system so as to be useful.</p>
              <p>- In the revised version of the manuscript, we did the model evaluation using the actual data in the month of October. The following figure shows how the predicted number of cases (red line) looks as compared with the actual reported case by ministry of health (blue line). The result reveals that the predicted number of cases by the proposed model are a bit higher than the actual cases. This may be due to under reported cases because of very low test coverage in Ethiopia. Further, the difference between the actual reported number of cases and predicted cases ranges from 2053 to 6946 individuals which is acceptable prediction in error in a country with a large population (above 110 million in the case of Ethiopia). The two lines have similar slopes, and that the numbers of cases are similar given the margins of error and likely under-detection.</p>
              <p>- Under moderate implementation of NPIs (20% -social distancing, 5%-face mask coverage, and 25% hand wash), we compared predicted cases of with data available from the ministry of health. The predicted and observed cases are shown in Fig 11. The predicted cases are very close to those observed, and there is a similar slope, indicating that our model is successfully capturing the dynamics of Covid-19 in Ethiopia. </p>
              <p>In response to review comment #3 the authors state that the results in Table 4 arose from different "interventions enforced by the government" over the time period modeled. However there is no statement about government timing of interventions in the data section. It appears Table 4 gives model results assumed to be from the interventions and adherence levels given in Table 2, but there is no mention of the timing of these interventions. So if the interventions start at the beginning of the time period and remain constant, why are the R0s changing so much over time in the model results in Table 4?</p>
              <p>- Yes, the interventions start at the beginning of the time period and remain constant, while the adherence level in the population varies over time. For instance, in the week after the holidays of Easter and Ramadan (61-90 days since the onset of COVID in Ethiopia), there was increased travelling and intense interaction in the population. Moreover only schools remain closed, and social distancing in public transport and market places wasn’t adhered to. The government was able to support and enforce wearing of face masks in public but, due to socioeconomic constraints, was less able to enforce adherence to social distancing and hand washing.</p>
              <p>- The MATLAB code calculates the new Ro considering time-varying levels of adherence to the NPIs. The MATLAB code included in the supplement. </p>
              <p>The references in the revision are still not formatted consistently.</p>
              <p> - Addressed.</p>
              <p>This article has still not been copyedited and since PLOS does not copy edit manuscripts this manuscript still needs to be corrected in many places for grammatical reasons.</p>
              <p>- Addressed. The revised manuscript edited by native speaker. </p>
              <p>Figure 1 is still unclear - there are still dashed lines with no arrows and one dashed line with an arrow - what do the dashed lines represent? The arrows are still left out.</p>
              <p>- In Figure 1 we have two main compartments: i) Human population and ii) Environment. To delineate the human to human (H2H) interaction and progression from different states (SEIR) we used solid lines. The interaction of these human compartments with the environment are indicated by broken lines. The dashed lines represent potential shedding of the virus to the environment by individuals in the asymptomatic and symptomatic compartments, the susceptible population may be infected from the contaminated environment. Such schematic representations has been used in modeling infectious diseases involving contaminated environment such as malaria and cholera.</p>
              <p>Table 1 - the values are a mixture of fraction and decimal notation - these should be uniform.</p>
              <p>- Addressed </p>
              <p> Supplementary information Comments</p>
              <p>1. In Theorem 0.1 there is a mention of Theorem 2.1 after the Theorem statement - what is this in reference to?</p>
              <p>- Thanks for pointing out this. It was a typo error and corrected in the revised version.</p>
              <p>2. Sensitivity analysis section states: The partial derivative of the threshold value Ro with respect to the input parameters were computed by varying the parameters around normal values.What are "normal values".</p>
              <p>- These values were obtained from the table of parameters the sensitivity analysis studies what would happen if we perturb the values within a certain interval.</p>
              <p>3. In the paragraph after eq (11) there is a [?] ref</p>
              <p>- A reference has been inserted.</p>
              <p>4. The Matlab codes provided have no overall description, nor do they appear to include the all calculations discussed in the paper - for example there does not appear to be any sensitivity analysis included in the Matlab codes</p>
              <p>- In the revised manuscript, a brief description of the Matlab codes is included. The sensitivity analysis code has also been included in the attached Matlab code.</p>
              <p>5. The references in the supplement are not in standard uniform style.</p>

              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>

              <p>Review Comments to the Author </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript has been improved. It has been copyedited, with many changes made. Most of the points raised by the previous review have been addressed, at least in part, in the manuscript. A few additional comments: 1. Although it has been copyedited, there are still places with grammatical errors, so another round of editing would be beneficials. A few places this reviewer saw that had errors are included below but another reading would likely catch other grammatical errors.</p>
              <p>- Thanks for going through the details and providing constructive comments which greatly improves the quality of the paper. A second-round grammatical editing was done by the native speaker co-authors.</p>
              <p>2. Although the response says "All references have been updated using a uniform bibliographic format", this is far from correct. There are many references that remain incomplete. These should all be changed before publication. Examples of incomplete references from just the first 15 include: </p>
              <p> - Thanks for pointing out this. Your concern is correct and corrected in the revised version.</p>
