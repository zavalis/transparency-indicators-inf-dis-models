              <abstract>
                <p>Cohort-independent robust mortality prediction model in patients with COVID-19 infection is not yet established. To build up a reliable, interpretable mortality prediction model with strong foresight, we have performed an international, bi-institutional study from China (Wuhan cohort, collected from January to March) and Germany (Würzburg cohort, collected from March to September). A Random Forest-based machine learning approach was applied to 1,352 patients from the Wuhan cohort, generating a mortality prediction model based on their clinical features. The results showed that five clinical features at admission, including lymphocyte (%), neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, could be used for mortality prediction of COVID-19 patients with more than 91% accuracy and 99% AUC. Additionally, the time-series analysis revealed that the predictive model based on these clinical features is very robust over time when patients are in the hospital, indicating the strong association of these five clinical features with the progression of treatment as well. Moreover, for different preexisting diseases, this model also demonstrated high predictive power. Finally, the mortality prediction model has been applied to the independent Würzburg cohort, resulting in high prediction accuracy (with above 90% accuracy and 85% AUC) as well, indicating the robustness of the model in different cohorts. In summary, this study has established the mortality prediction model that allowed early classification of COVID-19 patients, not only at admission but also along the treatment timeline, not only cohort-independent but also highly interpretable. This model represents a valuable tool for triaging and optimizing the resources in COVID-19 patients.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency of international concern (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Salyer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Sirleaf and Clark, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Watson and Lilford, 2021</xref>). As of July 12, 2021, 187, 796, 841 confirmed infection cases have been reported by the World Health Organization, with a global mortality rate of 2.16% (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19.who.int/">https://covid19.who.int/</ext-link>). Even worse, the incidence of COVID-19 is continuously increasing worldwide, and areas already under control are likely to relapse (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Setti et al., 2020</xref>). The proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients is 18.5% (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Epidemiology Working Group for Ncip Epidemic Response CCfDC, Prevention, 2020</xref>), and this high proportion of severe cases has put enormous pressure on medical systems, resulting in a serious shortage of medical resources (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ammar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Wahlster et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
              <p>In recent years, machine learning methods used for large clinical data analysis have been sprung up (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Gomes and Serra, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ikemura et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Yan et al<italic>.</italic> used the XGBoost classifier (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Guestrin, 2016</xref>) to predict the outcome of 485 patients using the final samples at discharge, and they found three blood features that could be used as predictors, providing important evidence for clinical decision-making and patient management (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2020</xref>). Xiao et al<italic>.</italic> have used the HNC-LL score that considered hypertension, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocyte count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to predict the severity of COVID-19 with AUC higher than 0.82 based on 442 patients (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>). Liang et al. developed a deep learning survival Cox model for 1,590 patients’ triage, which was based on four clinical features and six phenotypic characteristics, to ensure patients at the greatest risk for severe illness receive appropriate care as early as possible (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2020</xref>). Wu et al<italic>.</italic> also used the Cox model to investigate the key risk factors and predicted the mortality rate of 21,392 COVID-19 patients based on demographic, clinical, and laboratory features and found that the mortality rate increased with time, especially for these critically ill patients (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, although the clinical features of COVID-19 patients have been reported in several recent publications (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2020</xref>), such as decreased lymphocytes and elevated CRP (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2020</xref>), the predictive powers and interpretations of these clinical features remain unclear. Additionally, since progression and outcome are critical for COVID-19 patients (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Risch, 2020</xref>), timely monitoring from admission to outcome also has important clinical significance, making it possible to adjust treatment regimens in time, but this process is not entirely clear. Moreover, the foresight of a predictive model, as to how many days before discharge these features could accurately predict the patients’ outcome, remains elusive. However, the association of these clinical features with phenotypic characteristics is also unclear. The robustness of the mortality prediction model along the timeline and the predictive power considering different preexisting diseases also need further exploration. Therefore, we performed this international, bi-institutional study to establish a mortality prediction model with the aim of early triaging and optimizing the resources.</p>

                <title>Sample Description</title>
                <p>Clinical data were collected from 1,441 COVID-19 patients from January 28, 2020, to March 29, 2020, at Wuhan Union Hospital (also called Wuhan cohort), China, for model development. Moreover, 96 patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease were collected from the University Hospital of Würzburg (also called Würzburg cohort), Germany, from March 6, 2020, to September 14, 2020, for independent test.</p>
                <p>For the Wuhan cohort, more than 300 clinical features from hospital laboratory tests were recorded, and most patients have multiple sets of clinical features during their stay in the hospital. In addition, physical examinations, such as height, weight, temperature, sphygmus, systolic/diastolic pressure, respiratory rate, and heart rate, were performed upon admission of these COVID-19 patients. For robust analysis, clinical features that covered less than 30 samples, as well as samples containing fewer than three clinical features, were discarded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). After filtering out low-quality records, 1,352 patients and 130 clinical features were selected for systematic analysis. The average age of these patients was 58.22 (standard error: 14.90), and 50.52% of them were male, indicating a balanced gender. The minimal, maximal, and median duration from admission to discharge of the 1,352 patients is 0, 55, and 10 days, respectively. Among all of 1,352 COVID-19 patients, 1,221 patients survived and 131 died (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p>

Here, 330 features in the Wuhan cohort were the union of 1,441 patients’ clinical features and 130 features were the union of the 1,352 patients’ clinical features after filtering. “≥3 features” says that the patients from the Wuhan cohort should contain at least three clinical features during the hospital stays, and “≥30 patients” says that the clinical features that collected from clinical laboratory should cover at least 30 patients and thus could be used for subsequent analysis. In the Würzburg cohort, “≥1 feature” says that the patient should contain at least one of the features from these four clinical features: lymphocyte (%), neutrophil count, LDH, and CRP. <bold>(B)</bold> Different types of clinical features and phenotypic characteristics used in the two cohorts. We used clinical features from hospital laboratory tests for developing the prediction model, and these clinical features were also used to test the association with phenotypic characteristics and other records. <bold>(C)</bold> Overview of samples used for model development and independent test. Samples of 1,352 COVID-19 patients from Wuhan Union Hospital (Wuhan cohort, the blue background) were used for building and testing the mortality prediction model, while samples of 81 COVID-19 patients from Germany (Würzburg cohort, the orange background) were used for independent test of the mortality prediction model. The green number represents the number of patients who survived from COVID-19, while the red number means the number of patients who died from COVID-19. Note that several patients have more than one preexisting disease.</p>

                <p>Clinical features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) from hospital laboratory tests were primarily composed of two parts: 101 numerical features, such as LDH and CRP, and 29 binary features, such as ABO blood type, Mp-IgM, and Mp-IgG. These clinical features were considered as candidate biomarkers for COVID19 mortality prognosis.</p>
                <p>Phenotypic characteristics at admission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) were primarily composed of two parts: numerical and binary phenotypic characteristics. The numerical phenotypic characteristics included age, height, weight, temperature, sphygmus, systolic/diastolic pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and clinical classification. Binary phenotypic characteristics included records of gender, smoking status, and blood type.</p>
                <p>Recent studies have already reported that the outcome of COVID-19 patients is greatly influenced by whether the patient has a preexisting disease (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Azevedo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Williamson et al., 2020</xref>), such as CHD (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Mai et al., 2020</xref>), hypertension (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Itoh, 2020</xref>), and diabetes (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2020b</xref>). Here, we divided 1,352 COVID-19 patients into seven groups: s/p stroke (23 survived and seven died), CHD (89, 11), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (12, 2), diabetes (155, 21), hypertension (306, 45), malignant tumor (56, 15), and those without preexisting diseases (767, 60) according to their past medical history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
                <p>For the 96 patients in the Würzburg cohort, we have filtered out the patient who has not a single clinical feature among the four clinical features (lymphocyte (%), neutrophil count, LDH, and CRP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). After this process, 81 samples were retained and utilized for independent test. For these 81 patients, their phenotypic characteristics including systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, temperature, heart rate, SpO<sub>2</sub>, age, and respiratory rate were also used for analysis. The average age of these patients was 67.15 years (standard error: 15.17), which was significantly higher than that of patients in the Wuhan cohort (<italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0005). 62.96% of them are male, 53.67% of them have respiratory failure, and 41.46% of them need mechanical ventilation. Among them, 72 survived and nine died from COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p>

In this work, among 1,352 patients from the Wuhan cohort, 896 were in general, 393 were in severe, and 63 were in critical. For the Würzburg cohort, 24 were in general, 35 were in severe, and 22 were in critical. Here, we defined severity classification as follows: general as 1, severe as 2, and critical as 3.</p>

                <p>Using patient samples at admission, all numerical clinical features were normalized to a range [0, 1]. These normalized data with an average abundance ≥0.001 were illustrated as boxplots using the R package “ggplot2”. To illustrate differences between patients who survived and died, as well as between patients with or without preexisting diseases, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed using all patients’ numerical clinical features at admission based on the Jaccard coefficient for distance measurement using the R package “vegan”.</p>

                <title>Feature Selection and Development of a Prediction Model Utilizing Clinical Features</title>
                <p>To identify the most important clinical features that reflect differences among the samples, feature selection was employed for a deeper understanding of COVID-19 infection. We assessed the contribution of each clinical feature to facilitate the decisions of the algorithm. Considering both MeanDecreaseAccuracy and MeanDecreaseGini, the top five discriminatory clinical features were selected. Different Random Forest (RF) models were tested on the top five important clinical features, as well as their different combinations according to their importance.</p>
                <p>To develop a mortality prediction model that is capable of distinguishing the outcome of COVID-19 patients, RF analysis was performed by randomForest() function in R (package “randomForest”). For the sample size larger than 100, we randomly selected 90% of samples as training set and 10% of samples as testing set using sample() function with replacement. In this process, replace parameter was set as true, which specifies using the Bootstrap method for random sampling. For each model, based on each training set, the important parameters ntree (number of decision trees contained in the RF model) and mtry (variable sampling values for each iteration) were trained and estimated with the out-of-bag (OOB) value. The importance was set as true for calculating the importance of each variable in the model, which was mainly used in conjunction with the importance() function. The proximity parameters were set as true for calculating the proximity matrix of the model, which is mainly used in conjunction with the MDSplot() function to realize the visualization of random forest. The na.action parameter specifies the methods for handling the missing values and was set as na.omi (that is, delete the samples with missing values of all features). Other parameters were set as default. A traversal search was performed on all clinical features to obtain the minimum OOB value. The value of mtry was determined by the OOB value (that is, the index of the minimum OOB value). Then, combining the outcome of COVID-19 patients, the mtry value was iterated to obtain an optimal ntree. This process was iterated 15,000 times or more to construct the most accurate model. When the error tree approaches stable, the minimum number of trees was the best value for ntree. This trained model was used for predicting the outcome of the testing set.</p>

To train the RF model, the dataset was randomly separated into two groups: the training set (90% of entries) was applied to construct the mortality prediction model, and the testing set (10% of entries) was applied to validate the mortality prediction model. For datasets with a sample size of less than 100, we used 70% of the dataset for training and 30% for testing to reduce the contingency error. This process was iterated 15,000 times to construct the most accurate model. The most discriminative clinical feature was used as the root node of this binary decision tree, and the child nodes were hierarchically formed according to their distinguishing ability until all samples are completely distinguished.

              <title>Results</title>
              <p>In this study, we have recruited two independent cohorts from China (the Wuhan cohort) and Germany (the Würzburg cohort) for building and testing a mortality prediction model, respectively. The Wuhan cohort contained 1,352 COVID-19 patients from Wuhan Union Hospital, and it has been utilized for establishing a multi-feature and time-series aware machine learning models. The Würzburg cohort consists of 81 COVID-19 patients and has been used as an independent validation cohort.</p>

                <title>Data Resource and General Profiles of COVID-19 Patients from Wuhan Cohort</title>
                <p>1,352 patients were enrolled in the Wuhan cohort, who had more than three clinical features (such as neutrophil count, CRP, lymphocyte count, LDH, albumin, direct bilirubin, and creatine kinase) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>) and detailed medicinal records from January 28, 2020, to March 29, 2020. The distribution of the number of patients with clinical laboratory tests on a daily basis, as well as the total number of diagnoses for each patient, is shown in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. Among them, the mortality rates in patients with preexisting diseases: s/p stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, hypertension, and malignant tumor were 23.33, 11.00, 14.29, 11.93, 12.82, and 21.13%, respectively (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figures S2A,B</xref>). These mortality rates were significantly higher (<italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) than those in patients without preexisting diseases (mortality rate: 7.26%). PCoA showed that if we used all clinical features, these patients cannot be clearly separated (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>). In addition, these patients could not be separated by whether they had a preexisting disease or not (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figures S2D–J</xref>). This highlights the importance of clinical feature selection and developing the mortality prediction models to differentiate patients.</p>

                <title>Development and Evaluation of Clinical Feature Selection and Mortality Prediction Model for Early Prognosis Based on Wuhan Cohort</title>
                <p>We first developed a mortality prediction model based on patients’ samples at admission, since such prediction is of paramount importance in clinics (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Risch, 2020</xref>). This model took the clinical features and outcomes into consideration, aiming to optimize the medical resources, as well as preemptive therapy.</p>
                <p>Before developing a mortality prediction model, we divided the 130 clinical features into two parts: 101 numerical features and 29 binary features. For numerical features, those features which are identified with the average abundance ≥0.001 are shown in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>. 101 numerical clinical features with at least 30 samples’ coverage were considered as the outcome predictors and were used to build the mortality prediction model. We used 90% of the samples for model training and 10% for testing to validate the model.</p>
                <p>Combined MeanDecreaseAccuracy and MeanDecreaseGini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), lymphocyte (%), neutrophil count, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), and α-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase (α-HBDH) were selected for developing an optimized model, where lymphocyte (%) is an immune disorder indicator (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Trowell, 1947</xref>), neutrophil count represents infection (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2020</xref>), CRP represents inflammatory response (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Vermeire et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Sabrina et al., 2012</xref>), and both LDH and α-HBDH represent tissue lesions (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Sanwald and Kirk, 1966</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Kishaba et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

                </fig>
                <p>We then used these five selected numerical clinical features (lymphocyte (%), neutrophil count, CRP, LDH, and α-HBDH), as well as different combinations of the subset of these five clinical features according to their importance, for prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Results showed that the performance of these five clinical features could be comparable to the results predicted by all numerical features. Considering the F1 score, accuracy, and AUC, the combination of lymphocyte (%), neutrophil count, and LDH also showed high performance, especially the performance of α-HBDH used alone (bold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Several specified combinations of three out of these five clinical features, such as the combination of lymphocyte (%), neutrophil count, and LDH, also reached more than 91% accuracy and 99% AUC at admission. However, in clinics, these five features covered more types of clinical symptoms: lymphocyte (%) is an immune disorder indicator (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Trowell, 1947</xref>), neutrophil count represents infection (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2020</xref>), CRP represents inflammatory response (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Vermeire et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Sabrina et al., 2012</xref>), and both LDH and α-HBDH represent tissue lesions (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Sanwald and Kirk, 1966</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Kishaba et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we confirmed these five clinical features as credible biomarkers.</p>
                <p>To benchmark with other classification algorithms, we also used FEAST (an expectation–maximization-based unsupervised learning method) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Shenhav et al., 2019</xref>) and JSD (Jensen–Shannon divergence) methods (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lin, 1991</xref>) to predict the outcome of COVID-19 patients based on all features, the top five features, and the top three features (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Results demonstrated that the RF model was more or equally credible for constructing the mortality prediction model. The neural network (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Kriegeskorte and Golan, 2019</xref>) with two hidden layers (the first layer has 128 neurons and the second layer has eight neurons) also illustrated that RF model based on the combination of lymphocyte (%), neutrophil, LDH, CRP, and α-HBDH could best predict the outcome of COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Moreover, all three methods (RF, FEAST, JSD, and neural network) showed the best distinguishing power when using the top five clinical features to construct the model.</p>
                <p>We also used the binary clinical features (such as urine occult blood, blood type, and COVID-19 nucleic acid) to build the mortality prediction model (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S6A</xref>). Based on the contribution of each feature, we selected urine protein (UPRO), urine occult blood (UOB), monospecific antibodies of blood type (Ab-monospecific-B), ABO blood type (ABO), and ketones (KET) for further model improvement. Their different combinations and performance are shown in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S6B</xref>. Among them, the combination of UPRO, UOB, and KET (accuracy = 99.61%; AUC = 99.96%) was outstanding from the others, followed by UPRO, all binary features, and the combination of these five features.</p>
                <p>Finally, we emphasized that all of the above results were based on the first samples at admission, since it is more important for the clinical prediction to utilize these samples. It was noticed that a recently published study used the final samples of COVID-19 patients for predicting their outcome (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2020</xref>), and we also used the final samples in the Wuhan cohort to assess our model based on five selected features (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>), with results showing high prediction accuracy. Yet, the prediction accuracy and AUC based on first samples at admission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) were comparable to those based on these final samples for the Wuhan cohort. These results confirmed again that patients with a high mortality rate could be accurately predicted at admission, which could be used for prioritizing critically ill patients to potentially reduce the mortality rate.</p>

                <title>Clinical Features Have Profound Association with Phenotypic Characteristics in the Wuhan Cohort</title>
                <p>Notable correlations were observed between phenotypic characteristics and clinical features associated with COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figures S8, S9</xref>). Among 101 numerical clinical features, many of them have shown significant correlations with age, respiratory rate, and severity classification of patients. Expect for lymphocyte (%), neutrophil count, LDH, CRP, and α-HBDH were positively correlated with age (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) along the timeline. Since the above analyses also confirmed that these five clinical features are tightly associated with patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), these associations partially verified the fact that elder patients were more likely to die from COVID-19. LDH, CRP, and α-HBDH were also positively correlated with respiratory rate and severity classification (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in patients (896 were in general, 392 were in severe, and 63 were in critical), illustrating the importance of these phenotypic characteristics on outcome in COVID-19 patients.

For datasets with a sample size of less than 100, we used 70% of the dataset for training and 30% as a test set for validation. Since the sample number was less than 50 for patients who stayed in the hospital longer than 40 days, we only used the dataset from admission-day 0 to admission-day 40 to build the time-series mortality prediction models.

                <title>The Highly Accurate and Interpretable Binary Decision Tree for Clinical Diagnosis</title>
                <p>To make the prediction interpretable, we also generated a series of decision trees (along the timeline) for assisting clinical diagnosis based on the Wuhan cohort. The decision tree is hierarchically organized by the distinguishing ability of these five clinical features based on the first samples at admission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). LDH could distinguish 87% of samples with more than 96% accuracy and was used as the root node of this decision tree. The remaining 13% of samples were differentiated by a combination of these five clinical features. The binary decision tree of the final samples at discharge was simpler than that of the first samples at admission (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S10E</xref>). The decision trees based on other time points are shown in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figures S10A–D</xref>, confirming that using these five clinical features was more comprehensive and precise. These results also suggested that the mortality prediction model based on the admission samples, rather than the discharge samples, could already provide outcome prediction and clinical guidance for personalized treatment with high fidelity.</p>
                <p>The binary decision tree, either based on samples at admission or based on discharge, was also highly interpretable for clinical diagnosis. The elevated LDH was associated with patients’ death: LDH larger than 445 u/l was a significant risk factor related to death in cases with severe COVID-19 (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>), which was consistent with our results. The increased level of α-HBDH was also found as a critical risk factor associated with the severity of COVID-19 patients (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2020</xref>). The decreased amount of lymphocyte (lymphopenia) and neutrophil (neutrophilia), together with the increased number of CRP and LDH, showed the immunological response to the virus, followed by severe virus infection (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Frater et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lippi and Plebani, 2020</xref>). In summary, current published clinical evidence could well support our decision tree.</p>

                <p>For different preexisting diseases, the clinical features that can accurately mark the COVID-19 patients’ outcomes are generally different. Previous studies have shown that preexisting disease increases the risk of COVID-19 mortality rate (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Williamson et al., 2020</xref>).

The results for patients with CHD are illustrated in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S11B</xref>.

              <title>Discussions and Conclusion</title>
              <p>Our study enrolled two independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients for reliable, interpretable, and universal mortality model evaluation. Through multiple analyses including RF analysis, association analysis, time-series analysis, etc., the mortality prediction model was established, evaluated, and achieved clinically creditable prediction power on the Wuhan cohort and Würzburg cohort.</p>
              <p>The mortality prediction model proposed in this study could help identify critically ill patients early and provide preferential treatment for each individual. Firstly, the five important clinical features (lymphocyte (%), neutrophil count, CRP, LDH, and α-HBDH) were identified. These five features could reflect several important aspects of disease development, such as viral infection (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Trowell, 1947</xref>), coexistence of other infections (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2020</xref>), immune reaction during pneumonia (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Sabrina et al., 2012</xref>), the severity of inflammatory response (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Vermeire et al., 2004</xref>), tissue/cell damage, and cardiac injury (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Sanwald and Kirk, 1966</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Kishaba et al., 2014</xref>), which could provide more information to monitor the progression of patients. Secondly, these five features could be used for predicting the outcome of COVID-19 patients with high accuracy. Thirdly, the foresight of the mortality prediction model was strong up to as early as 40 days or more before discharge. This indicates that our model could allow resource optimization to be conducted many days ahead, and physicians can make a preliminary judgment on the prognosis of patients according to this model to prompt the choice of clinical intervention in later stages.</p>
              <p>Our mortality prediction model shows superior prediction power at different time points during the course of the disease. Robust prediction power at different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) also suggests that the mortality prediction model provides important indicators for disease monitoring, indicating early clinical intervention for clinical treatment. Our mortality prediction model also shows superior prediction power for different preexisting diseases of patients, indicating the robustness of the mortality prediction model. These results could serve well as the basis for personalized treatment of COVID-19 patients.</p>
              <p>Our finding in the Wuhan cohort (model development) has also been tested in an independent cohort from Germany (Würzburg cohort). Although the international aspects such as the ethnicities, healthcare systems, hygienic measures, local regulations, and management strategies, as well as their average age (<italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0005), are different in these two cohorts, our mortality prediction model has also shown the high prediction power in tens of days ahead of patients’ discharge, underlining the robustness and the foresight of this model.</p>
              <p>The second COVID-19 wave in Europe is ongoing. This mortality prediction model has been validated at a European center and might provide a useful instrument for triaging the patients and optimizing the resources. Because we have a series of mortality prediction models with constant high accuracy along with the whole duration of patients’ stay in the hospital, we could adjust treatment for possibly serious patients on a day-to-day basis to reduce the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 as much as possible. In addition, our study also provides new insight into the mortality prediction model’s application value in other infectious disease outbreaks in the future.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study has established a mortality prediction model that allowed early classification of COVID-19 towards personalized treatment in these patients, not only at admission but also along the treatment timeline. This model may represent a valuable tool for triaging and optimizing the resources in patients with COVID-19 infection worldwide.</p>
