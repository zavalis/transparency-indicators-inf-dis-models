                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>India has been severely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to shortcomings in disease surveillance, the burden of mortality associated with COVID-19 remains poorly understood. We aimed to assess changes in mortality during the pandemic in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, using data on all-cause mortality within the district.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>For this observational study, we analysed comprehensive death registrations in Chennai, from Jan 1, 2016, to June 30, 2021. We estimated expected mortality without the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by fitting models to observed mortality time series during the pre-pandemic period, with stratification by age and sex. Additionally, we considered three periods of interest: the first 4 weeks of India's first lockdown (March 24 to April 20, 2020), the 4-month period including the first wave of the pandemic in Chennai (May 1 to Aug 31, 2020), and the 4-month period including the second wave of the pandemic in Chennai (March 1 to June 30, 2021). We computed the difference between observed and expected mortality from March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021, and compared pandemic-associated mortality across socioeconomically distinct communities (measured with use of 2011 census of India data) with regression analyses.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, 87â870 deaths were registered in areas of Chennai district represented by the 2011 census, exceeding expected deaths by 25â990 (95% uncertainty interval 25â640â26â360) or 5Â·18 (5Â·11â5Â·25) excess deaths per 1000 people. Stratified by age, excess deaths numbered 21Â·02 (20Â·54â21Â·49) excess deaths per 1000 people for individuals aged 60â69 years, 39Â·74 (38Â·73â40Â·69) for those aged 70â79 years, and 96Â·90 (93Â·35â100Â·16) for those aged 80 years or older. Neighbourhoods with lower socioeconomic status had 0Â·7% to 2Â·8% increases in pandemic-associated mortality per 1 SD increase in each measure of community disadvantage, due largely to a disproportionate increase in mortality within these neighbourhoods during the second wave. Conversely, differences in excess mortality across communities were not clearly associated with socioeconomic status measures during the first wave. For each increase by 1 SD in measures of community disadvantage, neighbourhoods had 3Â·6% to 8Â·6% lower pandemic-associated mortality during the first 4 weeks of India's country-wide lockdown, before widespread SARS-CoV-2 circulation was underway in Chennai. The greatest reductions in mortality during this early lockdown period were observed among men aged 20â29 years, with 58% (54â62) fewer deaths than expected from pre-pandemic trends.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Mortality in Chennai increased substantially but heterogeneously during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the greatest burden concentrated in disadvantaged communities. Reported COVID-19 deaths greatly underestimated pandemic-associated mortality.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para10">India is among the most severely affected countries in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with over 458â000 deaths reported by Nov 1, 2021. However, the true burden of disease is uncertain because of limitations in surveillance. Analyses informed by population-based serosurveys suggest that reported COVID-19 deaths might underestimate true mortality by a factor of seven to ten,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> in agreement with findings from other data sources such as household-based demographic surveys.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> In high-income countries, all-cause mortality data from comprehensive vital registration systems have provided insight into the extent of underreporting of deaths attributable to COVID-19, as well as disparities in pandemic-associated mortality across socioeconomic and demographic groups.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, few studies of all-cause mortality have been undertaken in India and other low-income and middle-income countries.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> As the extent of COVID-19 mortality and the effect of lockdown measures on other causes of death might differ in such settings compared with high-income countries, studies of this nature in India remain an important priority.</p>
              <p id="para20">Chennai is an administrative district within the southern state of Tamil Nadu and the centre of India's fourth largest metropolitan area. The first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Tamil Nadu were reported in Chennai and, throughout the pandemic, Chennai has surpassed all other districts of the state in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths per 1000 population (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2 p 5</xref>).<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Although not the wealthiest region of India, Tamil Nadu is known for its effective public health and health-care delivery systems, and it ranks among the states with the highest per-capita health spending and largest health workforce.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Death registrations captured by the state's Civil Registration System (CRS) closely match mortality estimates from India's demographic survey-based Sample Registration System, making Tamil Nadu one of few Indian states where civil registration systems are considered a reliable basis for mortality surveillance.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para50">We searched the terms âcoronavirus disease 2019â, âCOVID-19â, âall-causeâ, âexcessâ, âdeathsâ, âmortalityâ, and âdisparityâ in PubMed and Google Scholar to identify studies published in English up to Sept 1, 2021, addressing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on deaths due to all causes, across all countries and settings, as well as studies addressing variation in COVID-19 burden across different socioeconomic groups within countries. Multiple studies of excess all-cause mortality have been undertaken in the USA, nationally and within major cities, and within both individual European countries and all countries served by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, at various points in the pandemic. As of June 30, 2021, such settings recorded roughly one to two excess deaths per 1000 people associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In New Zealand, where widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission has not occurred, reductions in all-cause mortality have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. High-quality studies of excess mortality in low-income and middle-income countries were less widely available; one study generated a real-time, updated database of excess mortality estimates for 103 countries and territories based on publicly available all-cause mortality data, but information on the reliability, timeliness, and completeness of vital registration systems generating the underlying information was not readily available. We found no studies of excess all-cause mortality in India. Lastly, numerous studies have reported on ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 incidence and mortality, primarily in the USA and UK. Expect for large-scale studies addressing community-level predictors of variation in COVID-19 burden in Brazil and one study addressing differences in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in slum and non-slum communities within Mumbai, we found no studies comparing the burden of COVID-19 (including COVID-19 mortality) across socioeconomically distinct communities within low-income and middle-income countries.</p>
                  <p id="para60">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">In Chennai, India, where a well functioning civil registration system is in place for mortality surveillance, there were 5Â·2 excess deaths per 1000 individuals overall through the COVID-19 pandemic; excess mortality was substantially higher in older age groups. We observed greater increases in mortality in communities with lower socioeconomic status during the second wave of infections, but not during the first wave. We also observed reductions in all-cause mortality concentrated among young adult men and within communities of low socioeconomic status immediately after the country-wide lockdown in March 24, 2020, before SARS-CoV-2 transmission was widespread. Although lockdown-associated reductions in adult mortality were transient, we observed reduced mortality among children in Chennai throughout the pandemic.</p>
                  <p id="para80">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">By comparison with higher-income settings, Chennai had substantial excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic despite the younger age distribution of its residents, with a more than two-times higher burden of excess deaths per 1000 people. COVID-19 pandemic-associated mortality in this setting is considerably underestimated by deaths reported among confirmed COVID-19 cases. Socioeconomically disadvantaged communities shouldered a greater burden of deaths during the pandemic in Chennai than higher-resource communities, although nonpharmaceutical interventions might have reduced deaths due to certain causes before widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission was underway.</p>

              </p>
              <p id="para100">We analysed comprehensive death records from Chennai district from Jan 1, 2016, to June 30, 2021, with the aim of measuring changes in mortality during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. We further examined differences in pandemic-associated mortality across socioeconomically distinct communities within Chennai, overall, and during specific periods of the pandemic.</p>

                <p id="para110">The CRS operates under the aegis of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act of 1969, which mandates the registration of all births and deaths in India and provides standardised elements for data collection and reporting.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Throughout India, vital statistics are recorded through a network of local registration units under a decentralised model, which states and districts are expected to customise to develop effective strategies for their distinct contexts. In Tamil Nadu, a Coordinating Committee operates within each administrative district of the state to coordinate vital registration across government departments. Heads of affected households, in conjunction with executive officers of lower administrative subunits (taluks, blocks, or villages), have legal responsibility for notification of births and deaths occurring in the community to their local registration unit, while attendant physicians are responsible for notification of deaths in health-care facilities. Local police and community health workers are responsible for reporting deaths that they are the first to observe; further provisions allow for reporting and verification of deaths by other parties that can come into contact with the deceased, such as operators of crematories or cemeteries. Performance metrics of the CRS across localities are monitored against mortality estimates from India's survey-based Sample Registration System through annual assessments.</p>

                <p id="para120">For this observational study, we estimated pandemic-associated all-cause mortality during the period of the pandemic (defined as the period from March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021) by comparing reported deaths to predictions of mortality expected under a continuation of trends observed from Jan 1, 2016, to Feb 29, 2020 (pre-pandemic). Additionally, our analyses considered three specific periods of interest: first, the first 4 weeks of India's country-wide lockdown (March 24 to April 20, 2020), before community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was widespread in Chennai and surrounding areas;<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> second, the 4-month period encompassing the first wave of the pandemic in Chennai, from May 1 to Aug 31, 2020, after which cases declined or plateaued at lower levels (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2 p 26</xref>);<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and third, the 4-month period encompassing the second wave of the pandemic in Chennai, from March 1 to June 30, 2021, associated with emergence of the delta SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1.617.2).<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>
</p>
                <p id="para130">To define predicted mortality, we fitted generalised linear models with a negative binomial link function to time series of the 14-day moving average of daily deaths, stratified by age group (0â9 years, 10â19 years, 20â29 years, 30â39 years, 40â49 years, 50â59 years, 60â69 years, 70â79 years, and 80 years or older bins) and sex, over the pre-pandemic period. The models included age-specific and sex-specific population offsets and accounted for secular and seasonal trends, flexibly represented by harmonic functions (sine and cosine transformations of calendar date) fitted with 12-month, 6-month, 4-month, and 3-month period lengths (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2 p 3</xref>). We sampled predicted time series of cases during the pandemic period (and accompanying 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs]) through forward model projections. We propagated uncertainty by drawing from the multivariate normal distribution of regression parameter estimates, as well as the distribution of model residuals for predicted values. We quantified increases or decreases in all-cause mortality with ratios and differences of observed versus expected deaths. Additional details of model fitting and model selection are presented in <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2 (p 3</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para140">New district boundaries drawn in 2019 introduced to Chennai district areas not represented by earlier mortality surveillance. We thus limited analyses to postal index number (PIN) code areas within pre-2019 administrative boundaries; our findings should be taken to correspond to this area and population (estimated to be 4â995â398 as of 2020) rather than current district boundaries.</p>

                <p id="para160">We measured changes in life expectancy among residents of Chennai during the calendar years 2020 and 2021 relative to 2019. For analyses of 2021 data, we considered scenarios of a return to age-specific and sex-specific mortality rates consistent with either pre-pandemic (2019-level) or 2020-level observations for the months of July to December. We computed life expectancy at birth for men and women on the basis of observed mortality using life tables accounting for age-specific (within 5-year age intervals) and sex-specific population sizes and deaths. To propagate uncertainty, we modelled the number of deaths within each age and sex stratum as a binomially distributed random variable, parameterised by population sizes and annual probabilities of mortality.</p>

                <p id="para170">We next aimed to determine how changes in all-cause mortality during the pandemic differed across socioeconomically distinct communities. We tabulated deaths by PIN code area and measured 13 distinct socioeconomic attributes of the population within each PIN code area (listed in <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2, pp 4, 6</xref>) based on the city ward within which the primary post office was contained (154 wards of Chennai, before 2019 redistricting). Within eligible PIN code areas where 1000 or more deaths were observed over the study period, we measured relative mortality during the pandemic using the ratio of observed to expected mortality. We estimated expected mortality according to the negative binomial regression framework described previously for each PIN code area (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2 p 4</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para180">We assessed whether the degree of excess pandemic-associated mortality was associated with community socioeconomic status by fitting regression models relating the outcome of relative mortality (log-transformed ratio of observed to expected mortality), by PIN code area, to each socioeconomic measure as a predictor variable. As a complementary approach aimed at reducing the dimensionality of our socioeconomic measures, we did a principal component analysis of all 13 socioeconomic variables (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2 p 4</xref>) and used the same regression framework to estimate unadjusted and adjusted associations of mortality with principal component variables. We did analyses in R software (version 4.0.5).</p>

              <p id="para280">We estimated that 5Â·2 excess deaths occurred per 1000 residents during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chennai, representing a 41% increase over typical mortality levels. Most excess deaths occurred during the second wave of the pandemic, when mortality peaked at levels 4Â·75-times higher than pre-pandemic observations. However, fewer deaths were registered among children than expected on the basis of pre-pandemic observations. Communities with lower socioeconomic status had reductions in mortality during the early lockdown, but also had the greatest increases in mortality during the second wave. Therefore, such communities had a disproportionate burden of excess deaths overall. These observations provide insight into the impact of the pandemic across demographic groups in an urban setting within India, where knowledge of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 remains incomplete.</p>
              <p id="para290">Our estimates of excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chennai exceed those from numerous higher-income settings.

              <p id="para300">Few studies have addressed socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 burden within India and other low-income and middle-income countries. Our findings of greater excess mortality in disadvantaged communities, particularly during the second wave, might reflect the need to work outside the home in such communities and the higher risk of transmission within crowded housing. Lower access to care in disadvantaged communities might also contribute to excess mortality, particularly if severe shortages in health-care capacity exacerbated pre-existing disparities in health-care access during the severe second wave. By contrast, we did not identify greater excess mortality in disadvantaged communities during the first wave, potentially reflecting a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 introduction and early spread within communities with greater risk of pre-lockdown SARS-CoV-2 importation through inter-state or international travel. A seroprevalence study in JuneâJuly, 2020, identified higher cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection within slum communities of Mumbai than in other neighborhoods.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Although the study also reported higher estimates of the infection-fatality ratio in non-slum communities, findings should be interpreted cautiously due to differences in the age distribution of slum and non-slum settings and the potential for weaker case-based surveillance in slums.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Prevalent naturally-acquired immunity in communities hit hard by early waves of SARS-CoV-2 transmission might have affected which settings were most vulnerable to having cases and deaths after the emergence of the delta variant, which is associated with enhanced transmissibility and clinical severity.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> It is important to note that our aggregation of deaths by PIN code area might obscure socioeconomic distinctions across communities in Chennai, where formal and makeshift housing are often closely interspersed.

              <p id="para310">The reasons for mortality reductions among children and young adult men during the early lockdown merit consideration.

We also identified sustained reductions in mortality throughout the pandemic period for individuals aged 0â9 years and 10â19 years, including during the second wave. Communicable diseases are the leading cause of death within these age groups in India and account for 87% of deaths among children younger than 5 years.

              <p id="para320">Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted the functioning of civil mortality registration, potentially to different extents across socioeconomically distinct communities, several factors support the external validity of our findings. Expected and observed deaths were in close alignment before the lockdown and during the period between the two COVID-19 waves. During the early lockdown, reductions in mortality were more pronounced among men than among women, whereas Indian vital surveillance systems are generally more susceptible to under-ascertainment of female mortality.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Lastly, previous analyses have suggested greater degrees of underreporting of COVID-19 deaths among older age groups in India,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> by contrast with the observed concentration of excess all-cause mortality among older age groups at the start of lockdowns and throughout the pandemic period.

Factors contributing to under-ascertainment of COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic in India merit closer investigation.</p>
              <p id="para330">Our study has limitations. We analysed deaths due to all causes; determining the proportion of excess deaths attributable to interruptions in care for conditions other than COVID-19 remains a priority, although prospective studies might be needed to support reliable ascertainment of cause of death.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Chennai residents who died in other districts might be missed by CRS data; however, the combination of inter-state and inter-district travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and the concentration of tertiary health-care facilities in Chennai reduce the likelihood of undercounting due to this factor. Our analyses of differences in mortality across communities relied on socioeconomic data from the most recent census of India, undertaken in 2011.
