                <p id="Par1">To support public health policymakers in Connecticut, we developed a flexible county-structured compartmental SEIR-type model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 disease progression. Our goals were to provide projections of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, and estimates of important features of disease transmission and clinical progression. In this paper, we outline the model design, implementation and calibration, and describe how projections and estimates were used to meet the changing requirements of policymakers and officials in Connecticut from March 2020 to February 2021. The approach takes advantage of our unique access to Connecticut public health surveillance and hospital data and our direct connection to state officials and policymakers. We calibrated this model to data on deaths and hospitalizations and developed a novel measure of close interpersonal contact frequency to capture changes in transmission risk over time and used multiple local data sources to infer dynamics of time-varying model inputs. Estimated epidemiologic features of the COVID-19 epidemic in Connecticut include the effective reproduction number, cumulative incidence of infection, infection hospitalization and fatality ratios, and the case detection ratio. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations inherent in predicting uncertain epidemic trajectories and lessons learned from one year of providing COVID-19 projections in Connecticut.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Epidemiologic models of infectious disease transmission have played an important role in supporting public health decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. By specifying structural features of infection transmission dynamics, models can provide insights into epidemiologic parameters, historical trends in epidemic dynamics, or future outcomes under hypothetical intervention scenarios. Transmission models are especially useful in situations of high uncertainty, offering a structured way to assess the potential effects of interventions given plausible assumptions about disease transmission. Transmission models may also be useful for short-term forecasting: when it is feasible to assume that key epidemiologic features will remain constant over time, such models can provide projections of natural transmission dynamics given the current state of an epidemic. Models cannot predict the future with certainty, but they can be helpful for scenario analysis by bounding the range of plausible future trajectories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. At the same time, simple models may have poor inferential and predictive performance if they fail to capture important features of disease transmission that may vary over time.</p>
              <p id="Par3">In early 2020, many countries, including the US, faced a public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In places like New York City and large cities in California, COVID-19 cases increased rapidly. In New York City, severely ill patients overwhelmed hospitals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> with death rates as high as 9% among confirmed cases and 32% among hospitalized patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Policymakers from the US regions first affected by the pandemic, Connecticut being one of them, were unprepared for its magnitude and severity. In the absence of effective pharmaceutical interventions, state and local governments turned to public health control measures that were last widely used during the 1918 influenza pandemic, such as social distancing and stay-at-home orders, to slow transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As transmission subsided, states began considering phased lifting of social distancing restrictions. Several urgent questions emerged: (1) How soon can interventions like school closures and stay-at-home orders be lifted? (2) How should public health interventions be implemented to minimize the risk of a resurgence? (3) What will be the effect of phased reopening plans on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths? Surveillance data on testing, case counts, hospitalizations, and deaths were useful in characterizing the dynamics of the initial wave, but policymakers needed predictive analytic tools to evaluate the current state of an epidemic and assess the risk of future resurgence.</p>
              <p id="Par4">A wide variety of predictive and explanatory models were developed during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. They included both mechanistic and phenomenological (statistical) models and were constructed for several related purposes. Many models sought to estimate basic epidemiologic parameters including the basic reproduction number (<inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Some models produced simulated future outcomes under hypothetical behavioral or interventional scenarios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Other models had a retrospective inferential goal of estimating effects of past interventions including lockdown and other non-pharmaceutical measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Some early models did not calibrate parameters to data, and instead simulated from models parameterized using published estimates from early observational studies or other infections with similar properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Intervention effects were often included as constant model parameters or estimated by calibrating the model separately to pre- and post-intervention time periods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In the early stages of the pandemic, these models helped demonstrate the dangers of unmitigated transmission and provided some evidence of the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions. However most of these models relied on publicly available data, often limited to official case counts, from the first wave of an epidemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and assumed constant transition rates (other than reduction in transmission following initial lockdown), and were therefore unable to adequately capture changing features of the COVID-19 burden, including behavioral changes, time-varying policy response, clinical management of the disease, or healthcare system dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Due to limitations of predictive performance of mechanistic models at early stages of epidemics when data are scarce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, some researchers used phenomenological models for the purposes of short- and medium-term forecasting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The advantage of data-driven statistical models compared to mechanistic models is that they require fewer assumptions and do not suffer from identifiability problems in a way that many SEIR-type models may<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, these models lack the ability to take advantage of the known features of infection transmission process and therefore are sometimes unable to offer insights into important features of past and future epidemic dynamics. They have limited use in scenario analyses that aim to assess potential effects of hypothetical interventions.</p>
              <p id="Par5">As the initial epidemic wave in Connecticut began to subside during the summer of 2020, local policymakers needed models that could answer specific questions about past and current infection dynamics, accommodate established epidemiologic features of disease transmission, permit prediction of outcomes under policy scenarios identified by stakeholders, and provide projections of policy-relevant outcomes under assumptions that could be understood by policymakers. Several nationwide forecasting tools were developed to provide state- or county-level projections, relying on data universally and publicly available across all locations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. These models employed assumptions applied universally across all locations and provided a limited set of outputs that were not always able to address the needs of local policymakers. These factors motivated the development of transmission models tailored to local context, the timing of intervention events and planned future policy changes, and data that were only available at the local level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">In this paper, we present a county-structured model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 disease progression in Connecticut. The model was developed and improved over the first year of the pandemic to support decision-making by Connecticut public health officials and policymakers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. This work is the result of continuous feedback from Connecticut public health officials, who provided detailed data on congregate and non-congregate testing, cases, and deaths, age-stratified cases, and hospitalization admissions and census – a feature that is absent from all nationwide analyses. We first describe the epidemic and public policy response in Connecticut, emphasizing the inferential questions articulated by public officials during development of the model. We then briefly describe the structure of the transmission model, its parameters, and data sources used for model calibration, with full details given in the Supplementary Material.

                <title>The COVID-19 epidemic and response in Connecticut</title>
                <p id="Par7">Connecticut (population 3.565 million) was among the US states most severely impacted by the first wave of COVID-19 epidemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. On March 8th, 2020, the first Connecticut COVID-19 case was reported, followed by a rapid increase in case counts. In the first three weeks of the epidemic, the state reported over 2500 confirmed COVID-19 cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. A similar rate of increase in hospitalizations followed, and on April 2, 2020, COVID-19 hospitalization census exceeded 1000. On March 17, Governor Ned Lamont ordered all in-person classes at K-12 schools canceled, and later extended the closure for the remainder of the 2019–2020 academic year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The Governor issued a statewide “Stay Safe, Stay Home” order to take effect on March 23<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The order called on all nonessential businesses to cease in-person operations. Essential businesses could remain open with additional restrictions and guidelines to minimize close contact and risk of transmission. Evidence from mobile device data suggests that Connecticut residents reduced their mobility before the official lockdown order went in effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par8">The number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Connecticut peaked on April 21, 2020 and began a slow decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In early May, Governor Lamont issued plans and guidance for reopening, a process set to begin with “Phase 1” on May 20 when some businesses, mostly those operating outdoors, were allowed to reopen at 50% capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Around the same time, we released a report that included COVID-19 transmission projections through August 31, 2020 under different scenarios of potential contact increase during the summer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Phase 2 of reopening began on June 17th when indoor dining, libraries and religious services were allowed to reopen at reduced capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Reopening was followed by scale-up in testing: the average daily number of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests increased from about 2,000 at the beginning of April to about 8,000 at the end of June<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par9">For most of summer 2020, case counts and hospitalizations in Connecticut remained low, even while large outbreaks were happening in many parts of the US<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The major state-level policy question during this time was whether and how to reopen primary, secondary, and college/university schooling in the fall. At the end of August, we developed model projections of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths for fall under different assumptions about the rate of close interpersonal contact associated with reopening of schools. These forecasts predicted increasing infections and a statewide resurgence during the fall 2020. In-person, remote, and hybrid education at all levels resumed in Connecticut in August and early September. Case counts and hospitalizations during fall 2020 increased slowly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, leading the Governor to implement Phase 3 reopening, permitting indoor businesses to operate at higher capacity, on October 8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. By early November, public health officials recognized a broad statewide epidemic resurgence. In response to rising case counts and fears of a substantial second wave, on November 6 Governor Lamont reverted to “Phase 2.1”, reducing permitted occupancy of indoor businesses and events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In-person education at most public schools and all universities ended in mid-November before the Thanksgiving recess. Asymptomatic testing programs implemented by many universities were subsequently scaled down, resulting in a reduction in testing rates in Connecticut – making it difficult to interpret changes in the test positive proportion. Case counts in the second wave of the epidemic peaked in mid-December, plateaued for about a month and began a slow decline starting the second half of January 2021.</p>

Vaccine deployment in Connecticut began on December 14th, 2020 with residents of congregate settings being vaccinated first.

                  <p id="Par13">The transmission model aims to capture community spread of SARS-CoV-2, and therefore excludes transmission occurring in congregate settings like skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, or prisons. Similar to<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, we excluded congregate settings, since transmission in small closed communities violates important modeling assumptions related to mixing patterns in the population. Available hospitalization data do not disaggregate by the patient’s place of residence at the time of diagnosis or hospitalization. According to CT DPH, as of October 30, 2020, about 73% of all deaths have occurred among residents of congregate settings, primarily nursing homes, emphasizing that the first wave of the epidemic was heavily dominated by transmission in this population. To address this issue, we estimated the time series of hospitalizations (census and cumulative) coming from non-congregate settings and used these estimated counts in the model calibration. We received data on daily COVID-19 death counts in hospitals disaggregated by the type of residence (congregate vs. non-congregate) at the time of diagnosis or hospitalization from CT DPH (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). Based on these data, we estimated the time-varying proportion of hospitalization census and cumulative hospitalizations coming from congregate and non-congregate settings.

We use daily PCR testing volume (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>I) to parameterize the time-varying duration of infectiousness among mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.

Therefore, in model parametrization, we assume a constant severe proportion early in the epidemic, and use these data to approximate changing severity proportion beyond the second phase of reopening, which started on June 17, 2020, when testing became widely available (vertical dashed line in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>H).

In practice, this implies that if hospitalization capacity is exceeded by 10 or more people, over 99% of new severe infections will be denied admission, meaning that the difference between the continuous and sharp thresholds is negligible. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> lists definitions of model parameters, some of which are time-varying as explained in the next section. The analysis was performed using the R statistical computing environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par20">Our transmission model does not include effects of vaccination, which began on December 14th, 2020. Initial vaccine deployment in Connecticut prioritized residents of congregate settings and individuals in the age group 75 years old and above. According to the CDC, COVID-19 vaccines achieve their full effectiveness 14 days after the second dose in a 2-dose series or a single dose in a 1-dose series<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. As of March 1, 2021, about 5% of non-congregate population in Connecticut were fully vaccinated. Given that some of these people may have already experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection, that the majority of them were older people who do not mix as much as younger working-age population, and that the proportion vaccinated is within the uncertainty bounds of the cumulative incidence, vaccine effects before March 1, 2021 are unlikely to have a substantial impact on model projections. At the same time, some of the vaccine effects, such as incidence and case fatality reduction among older people are captured in the dynamics of time-varying model parameters. As vaccination coverage among young and working-age individuals increases, it will become important to incorporate vaccine effects in the transmission model.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Transmission model parameters.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Notation</th><th align="left">Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><inline-formula id="IEq16"><alternatives><tex-math id="M33">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Longer-term projections were less useful due to anticipated changes in policy, public behavior, and time-varying parameters.

              <p id="Par35">As COVID-19 pandemic emerged, policymakers in many parts of the US and across the globe had to make quick decisions under high uncertainty. Access to reliable information about both the current state of the local epidemic and likely future outcomes is an important foundation to support policymakers in this process. Elected officials and public health agencies already have access to near real-time information about COVID-19 testing, case counts, hospitalizations, and deaths. However, these data may not provide timely insight into the current and future dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. Mathematical modeling of infectious diseases offers one way to address these questions, but is subject to limitations that may be difficult to communicate to policymakers. During our year-long collaboration with CT DPH, we learned several lessons in the process of developing, deploying, calibrating, revising, and communicating the outputs of COVID-19 transmission model to policymakers in Connecticut.</p>

However, as the data accrued, constant parameter values failed to achieve a good fit to the observed data. Our collaboration with CT DPH allowed us access to detailed local data informing time-varying model parameters. Incorporating time trends in important epidemic features like close interpersonal contact, risk profile of incident cases, hospital length of stay, and hospital case fatality ratio substantially improved model fit to observed data and its predictive performance. One of the limitations of our model is that it does not incorporate vaccination effects. However, during the modeling period ending on March 1, 2021 these effects are likely negligible in non-congregate residents due to low overall coverage that is primarily driven by an older age group, and are partially captured in the dynamics of time-varying parameters. As vaccination coverage increases, it will be important to include vaccination effects in the transmission model.</p>

This is a novel metric, whose dynamics exhibit different behavior from that observed in several publicly available mobility metrics, such as maximum distance traveled or time spent away from home, which mostly returned to their baseline values by mid-summer 2020<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Combined with other time-varying parameters, the close contact metric captured most of the variation in transmission over time.

Even though dynamics of detected cases may be a reasonable qualitative indicator of disease incidence, we found that its usefulness for modeling purposes is limited. It is widely recognized that detected case counts depend on the underlying infection incidence and testing volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, however we found that changes in testing strategies and human behavior may lead to non-monotonic relationship between testing volume and case detection rate. Since case counts dynamics are usually widely available across geographic locations, and are often among a few data sources easily accessible by researchers, many nationwide models rely on case counts, possibly adjusting for testing volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Our experience shows that this approach may be misleading. We therefore chose to rely on hospitalizations and death data for model calibration as these epidemic features are less susceptible to unmeasured time-varying confounding.</p>

                <title>Conclusions and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par43">Our year-long effort to provide policymakers with predictions of COVID-19 dynamics in Connecticut showed that standard SEIR-type transmission models work best in large well-mixing populations with constant transmission rates and without major external shocks, like interventions or importation of infections. In order to make valid inferences, it is necessary to incorporate temporal changes in model parameters reflecting interventions, human behavior, heterogeneity in mixing patterns, and measurement errors. Given geographic heterogeneity in the dynamics of these features, models that incorporate contextual information and local data are needed to support local policymakers. While modeling approach described in this paper captures many important features of epidemic dynamics that are often omitted in simpler SEIR-type models, our model could be extended to reflect more granular geographic variation, age structure and contact patterns between different age groups, vaccination effects, and other time-varying features of COVID-19 epidemic. When it works best, modeling provides heuristics, guidance, and what-if scenarios for the future offering insights that are otherwise unavailable.</p>
