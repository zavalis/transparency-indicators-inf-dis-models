                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Previous research pointed to a close relationship between the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in aging populations and socio-economic conditions, however there has been lack of studies focused on a region of unbalanced socio-economic development. The aim of this paper is to explore the spatio-temporal variation in TB incidence and examine risk determinants of the disease among aging populations in a typical region.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Data on TB-registered cases between 2009 and 2014, in addition to social-economic factors, were collected for each district/county in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, a region characterized by an aging population and disparities in social-economic development. A Bayesian space–time hierarchy model (BSTHM) was used to reveal spatio-temporal variation in the incidence of TB among the elderly in this region between 2009 to 2014. GeoDetector was applied to measure the determinant power (<italic>q</italic> statistic) of risk factors for TB among the elderly.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The incidence of TB among the elderly exhibited geographical spatial heterogeneity, with a higher incidence in underdeveloped rural areas compared with that in urban areas. Hotspots of TB incidence risk among the elderly were mostly located in north-eastern and southern areas in the study region, far from metropolitan areas. Areas with low risk were distributed mainly in the Beijing-Tianjin metropolitan areas. Social-economic factors had a non-linear influence on elderly TB incidence, with the dominant factors among rural populations being income (<italic>q</italic> = 0.20) and medical conditions (<italic>q</italic> = 0.17). These factors had a non-linear interactive effect on the incidence of TB among the elderly, with medical conditions and the level of economic development having the strongest effect (<italic>q</italic> = 0.54).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The findings explain spatio-temporal variation in TB incidence and risk determinants of elderly TB in the presence of disparities in social-economic development. High-risk zones were located mainly in rural areas, far from metropolitan centres. Medical conditions and the economic development level were significantly associated with elderly TB incidence, and these factors had a non-linear interactive effect on elderly TB incidence. The findings can help to optimize the allocation of health resources and to control TB transmission in the aging population in this region.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par9">Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne infectious disease caused by the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex; only pulmonary TB is contagious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is a serious and persistent infectious disease worldwide, which poses a threat to human health, resulting in approximately 10 million illnesses every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. According to World Health Organization (WHO) report, TB is ranked as one of the top 10 leading causes of death from a single infectious agent worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The elderly population carries the majority of the TB burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">TB has been considered a global public health emergency for the past decades, and much progress in reducing the incidence of TB has been made, however, no country has yet eliminated TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although the TB incidence rate is falling worldwide, with a decrease of 9% reported between 2015 and 2020, it has yet to reach the first milestone of the End TB Strategy (i.e. a 20% reduction in this period) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. TB remains a major public health problem in China, where there are nearly 830,000 new cases each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">The demographic structure of a population is a key determinant of infectious disease spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In socially underprivileged areas, elderly individuals have an increased risk of contracting TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The TB burden in the aging population remains a clinical and epidemiological challenge.</p>
              <p id="Par12">According to some research, regional TB incidence is closely associated with poverty, poor living conditions and human agglomeration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Poverty may affect susceptibility to infections and diseases through indirect effects of poor nutrition or depressed immune status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Based on current evidence, income, education, occupation and population density account for most health inequalities within countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, unbalanced regional development, with resulting consequences for socio-economic conditions, plays an important role in the incidence of TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">Using various spatial statistical methods, previous research confirmed that the risk of TB transmission is spatially heterogeneous. These methods included Moran’s I and spatial panel data models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], Kernel density estimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], spatial regression models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and geographically weighted regression models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, as these studies analysed only spatial aspects of TB transmission, they cannot reveal spatio-temporal variation in TB incidence and risk determinants of the disease in regions with unbalanced socio-economic development.</p>
              <p id="Par14">There were two primary aims of the present study: The first aim was to investigate spatio-temporal variation in the incidence of TB among individuals older than 65 years in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, which is a region with a high proportion of aging households and socio-economic disparities. The second aim was to investigate whether there was a non-linear association between the risk of TB in this aging population and socio-economic factors.</p>

                <p id="Par15">The study region was the North China Plain and consisted of the Beijing Municipality, Tianjin Municipality and Hebei Province. This region shows spatial heterogeneity in economic development. Beijing is the capital of China, Tianjin is one of a number of municipalities directly under the control of central government. Two neighbouring cities constitute a large metropolis. Surrounding the two cities is Hebei Province.</p>
                <p id="Par16">Economic development in the region is unbalanced, with many of the poorest counties in the country during the study period located in Hebei Province. In addition, aging of the population is becoming a growing concern in the study region, as the proportion of the population aged older than 65 years in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei is 8.72, 8.53 and 8.69%, respectively. This index is an important international criterion used to measure the degree of population aging in a country or a region, with values over 7% constituting an aging society.</p>

The counties in hotspots with a high spatial RR value were located primarily in the northwest mountainous regions and southeast rural regions in the study area.

Over time, there may an increase in the risk of TB cases in these counties due to slower rates of decline in incident cases. In the study, the temporal trend in 55.4% of hotspot counties was consistent with the overall trend. These counties will remain hotspots, with a high risk.</p>
                <p id="Par32">The local temporal trend in cold spots is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. In the study, 51.8% of cold spot counties showed a faster temporal decreasing trend compared with the overall temporal trend. Over time, these counties may continue to be cold spots, with a low risk. Meanwhile, 14.3% of cold spot counties showed a slower temporal decrease compared with the overall temporal trend. These counties will likely become higher risk areas or change into hotspots in time. Furthermore, 33.9% of cold spot counties had a temporal trend consistent with the overall trend. These counties will likely remain colds pots, with a low risk.</p>

                <p id="Par33">Elderly TB incidence was selected as the explanatory variable in the <italic>q</italic> statistic calculation. Seven potential socio-economic risk factors were selected as explanatory variables: per capita GDP, population density, proportion of primary industry in GDP, proportion of tertiary industry in GDP, per capita disposable income of urban residents, per capita disposable income of rural households and beds in health care institutions per 1000 persons. Using these variables, the risk factors and their interaction effects on elderly TB incidence were assessed (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

                <p id="Par34">The results showed that socio-economic and health condition factors were the dominant determinants of spatio-temporal variation in elderly TB incidence. Income of rural households showed the strongest association with elderly TB incidence.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par36">We designed the present study to analyse spatio-temporal variation in TB risk in the over-65 population and to detect potential factors influencing TB risk in a region of unbalanced socio-economic development in China (i.e. Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei). The results revealed the highest risk mainly in rural areas in the northeast and southwest, far from metropolitan areas. Interaction effects between health conditions and socio-economic factors had a significant effect on elderly TB incidence.</p>
              <p id="Par37">In the study, elderly TB risk showed significant spatial heterogeneity, with a relatively high risk primarily in the northwest mountainous regions and south rural regions and a relatively low risk mainly in larger cities and surrounding areas. In terms of risk factors, the proportion of primary industry and tertiary industry in GDP was significantly associated with elderly TB incidence. This finding confirms the impact factors in regions with unbalanced socio-economic development.</p>
              <p id="Par38">Our findings support those of other studies, which reported different urban and rural epidemiological characteristics of elderly TB patients, however, there were inconsistencies between these studies in terms of the TB risk level. For example, in a study carried out in Bangladesh, the authors reported higher TB-related mortality rates in urban than rural regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, results from Tanzania revealed significant differences in the epidemiological characteristics of TB in urban versus rural areas, with recurrent TB in rural but not urban regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In the present study, we found that elderly TB risk was lower in large cities and their surrounding regions compared with the risk in rural regions. This finding was likely because both health and economic conditions are good in the cities in the study region, with few low-income groups. In contrast, in the study conducted in Bangladesh, regional differences in TB death rates were associated with a high prevalence of the disease in urban areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These urban areas had a high population density, with one-third of the residents living in slums, a scenario that is favourable for TB transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par39">In this study, the regional economic development level was an important index of factors influencing TB transmission. Previous studies revealed an association between TB and per capita GDP, poverty, living standards and under-nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. According to a Global Tuberculosis Report 2020 published by the WHO, TB cases begin to decline in some parts of the Western world around the turn of the twentieth century because of improvements in housing, nutrition and economic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par40">Per capita GDP can provide insights into the effect of in macro-level economic determinants and the effects of policy on spatio-temporal variations in elderly TB incidence. Previous studies indicated that per capita GDP was significantly associated with TB incidence at the country or provincial level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A country with a high level of per capita GDP can allocate greater financial resources to TB control. Some reports have provided evidence of a positive association between GDP and the cost of TB case in-treatment. In countries with low socio-economic status and high levels of unemployment, TB inpatient treatment may not be an option for many people for financial reasons. A WHO report indicated that half of all TB patients faced catastrophically high treatment costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The findings of the present study suggested that unbalanced regional economic development contributes to spatial variation in TB incidence in the study area.</p>
              <p id="Par41">According to many previous studies, income level is an important determinant of TB transmission, with TB closely associated with poverty and an increase in the proportion of TB cases in accordance with low income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Low income may increase TB transmission rates via a direct interaction with poor living conditions and poor nutrition. In this study, income level was a significant predictor of regional-level variation in elderly TB incidence, with the level of rural income having more of an influence on elderly TB incidence than the level of urban income. According to previous studies, regional income imbalances create disparities in access to medical services, as well as delays in diagnoses and medical treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Thus, improving the income levels of metropolitan migrant workers and rural residents would be a powerful strategy to control TB among low-income groups.</p>
              <p id="Par42">In this study, population density was significantly associated with elderly TB incidence. Some previous studies reported a high TB incidence in areas of high population density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. For example, in a study in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the prevalence of TB in an urban region with a high population density was four times greater than that in other urban areas with lower population densities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Similarly, a study in South Africa showed that the incidence of TB was significantly greater in regions of higher than lower population density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A study in Tanzania reported that crowded living conditions increased TB transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, the present research pointed to a lower incidence of TB among the elderly in the Beijing and Tianjin urban agglomeration area. In this region, populations are concentrated in large cities, with a high level of medical care, good housing conditions and a good welfare system ensuring poverty elimination. Thus, elderly TB incidence in this urban agglomeration area with a high population density was low in our study.</p>
              <p id="Par43">This study has some limitations. TB is a multifactorial disease. Thus, factors other than those considered in the present study (e.g. socio-economic, micro-environmental and personal hygiene habits), may have affected the incidence of TB in the study region. We used aggregate data on a county-level spatial scale in modelling. This may have introduced an ecological fallacy effect for some factors.</p>
              <p id="Par44">Furthermore, new factors, such as epidemic of the other emerging infectious disease, will also influence the transmission of TB. Future research should consider additional factors that account for multi-level relationships in the incidence of TB.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par45">Our findings shed light on spatio-temporal variation in TB incidence and risk determinants of TB infection among the elderly in a region with disparities in socio-economic development. High-risk hotspots were located mainly in rural areas, far from metropolitan sectors, and medical conditions and economic development level were significantly associated with elderly TB incidence. These variables showed non-linear interactions with each other in influencing TB incidence. TB is of long standing, and the End TB Strategy, adopted by the WHO in 2014, includes targets for reductions in the TB disease burden in 2016–2035 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the study depicted a fundamental condition for the control of the disease in regions of unbalanced socio-economic development in the future.</p>
