                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Many popular disease transmission models have helped nations respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by informing decisions about pandemic planning, resource allocation, implementation of social distancing measures, lockdowns, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions. We study how five epidemiological models forecast and assess the course of the pandemic in India: a baseline curve-fitting model, an extended SIR (eSIR) model, two extended SEIR (SAPHIRE and SEIR-fansy) models, and a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model (ICM).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Using COVID-19 case-recovery-death count data reported in India from March 15 to October 15 to train the models, we generate predictions from each of the five models from October 16 to December 31. To compare prediction accuracy with respect to reported cumulative and active case counts and reported cumulative death counts, we compute the symmetric mean absolute prediction error (SMAPE) for each of the five models. For reported cumulative cases and deaths, we compute Pearson’s and Lin’s correlation coefficients to investigate how well the projected and observed reported counts agree. We also present underreporting factors when available, and comment on uncertainty of projections from each model.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">For active case counts, SMAPE values are 35.14% (SEIR-fansy) and 37.96% (eSIR). For cumulative case counts, SMAPE values are 6.89% (baseline), 6.59% (eSIR), 2.25% (SAPHIRE) and 2.29% (SEIR-fansy). For cumulative death counts, the SMAPE values are 4.74% (SEIR-fansy), 8.94% (eSIR) and 0.77% (ICM). Three models (SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM) return total (sum of reported and unreported) cumulative case counts as well. We compute underreporting factors as of October 31 and note that for cumulative cases, the SEIR-fansy model yields an underreporting factor of 7.25 and ICM model yields 4.54 for the same quantity. For total (sum of reported and unreported) cumulative deaths the SEIR-fansy model reports an underreporting factor of 2.97. On October 31, we observe 8.18 million cumulative reported cases, while the projections (in millions) from the baseline model are 8.71 (95% credible interval: 8.63–8.80), while eSIR yields 8.35 (7.19–9.60), SAPHIRE returns 8.17 (7.90–8.52) and SEIR-fansy projects 8.51 (8.18–8.85) million cases. Cumulative case projections from the eSIR model have the highest uncertainty in terms of width of 95% credible intervals, followed by those from SAPHIRE, the baseline model and finally SEIR-fansy.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">In this comparative paper, we describe five different models used to study the transmission dynamics of the SARS-Cov-2 virus in India. While simulation studies are the only gold standard way to compare the accuracy of the models, here we were uniquely poised to compare the projected case-counts against observed data on a test period. The largest variability across models is observed in predicting the “total” number of infections including reported and unreported cases (on which we have no validation data). The degree of under-reporting has been a major concern in India and is characterized in this report. Overall, the SEIR-fansy model appeared to be a good choice with publicly available R-package and desired flexibility plus accuracy.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par12">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. At the time of revising this paper (March 24, 2021), roughly 124 million cases have been reported worldwide. The disease was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Since then, more than 2.74 million lives have been lost as a direct consequence of the disease. Notable outbreaks were recorded in the United States of America, Brazil and India -- which remains a crucial battleground against the outbreak. The Indian government imposed very strict lockdown measures early in the course of the pandemic in order to reduce the spread of the virus. Said measures have not been as effective as was intended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with India now reporting the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia, and the third highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States and Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], with the number of confirmed cases crossing the 10 million mark on December 18, 2020. On March 24, 2020, the Government of India ordered a 21-day nationwide lockdown, later extending it until May 3. This was followed by two-week extensions starting May 3 and 17 with substantial relaxations. From June 1, the government started ‘unlocking’ most regions of the country in five unlock phases. In order to formulate and implement policy geared toward containment and mitigation, it is important to recognize the presence of highly variable contagion patterns across different Indian states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. India saw a decay in the virus curve in September, 2020 with daily number of cases going below 10,000. At the time of revising the paper, the daily incidence curve is sharply rising again, as India faces its second wave. There is a rising interest in studying potential trajectories that the infection can take in India to improve policy decisions.</p>
              <p id="Par13">A spectrum of models for projecting infectious disease spread have become widely popular in wake of the pandemic. Some popular models include the ones developed at the Institute of Health Metrics (IHME) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] (University of Washington, Seattle) and at the Imperial College London [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The IHME COVID-19 project initially relied on an extendable nonlinear mixed effects model for fitting parametrized curves to COVID-19 data, before moving to a compartmental model to analyze the pandemic and generate projections. The Imperial College model (henceforth referred to as ICM) works backwards from observed death counts to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks ago, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. A Bayesian mechanistic model is introduced - linking the infection cycle to observed deaths, inferring the total population infected (attack rates) as well as the time-varying reproduction number <italic>R</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). With the onset of the pandemic, there has been renewed interest in multi-compartment models, which have played a central role in modeling infectious disease dynamics since the twentieth century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The simplest of compartmental models include the standard SIR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] model, which has been extended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. Further extensions include one which adds a spatial component to this temporal model by making use of a cellular automata structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Larger compartmental models include those which incorporate different states of transition between susceptible, exposed, infected and removed (SEIR) compartments, which have been used in the early days of the pandemic in the Wuhan province of China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The SEIR compartmental model has been further extended to the SAPHIRE model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which accounts for the infectiousness of asymptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and pre-symptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] individuals in the population (both of which are crucial transmission features of COVID-19), time varying ascertainment rates, transmission rates and population movement.</p>
              <p id="Par14">Researchers and policymakers are relying on these models to plan and implement public health policies at the national and local levels. New models are emerging rapidly. Models often have conflicting messages, and it is hard to distinguish a good model from an unreliable one. Different models operate under different assumptions and provide different deliverables. In light of this, it is important to investigate and compare the findings of various models on a given test dataset. While some work has been done in terms of trying to reconcile results from different models of disease transmission that can be fit to emerging data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], more comparisons need to be done to investigate how differences between competing models might lead to differing projections on the same dataset. In the context of India, such head-to-head comparison across models are largely unavailable.</p>
              <p id="Par15">We consider five different models of different genre, starting from the simplest baseline model. The baseline model we investigate relies on curve-fitting methods, with cumulative number of infected cases modeled as an exponential process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Next, we consider the extended SIR (eSIR) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which uses a Bayesian hierarchical model to generate projections of proportions of infected and removed people at future time points. The SAPHIRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] model has been demonstrated to reconstruct the full-spectrum dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan between January and March 2020 across five periods defined by events and interventions. Using this, we study the evolution of the pandemic in India over nine well-defined lockdown and unlock periods, each with distinct transmission and ascertainment features. Another model, SEIR-fansy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] modifies the SEIR model to account for high false negative rate and symptom-based administration of COVID-19 tests. Finally, we study the ICM model, which utilizes a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model based on renewal equations that model infections as a latent process and links deaths to infections with the help of survival analysis<italic>.</italic> Each of the models mentioned above have had appreciable success in being able to satisfactorily analyze and project the trajectory of the pandemic in different countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">In order to fairly compare and contrast the models mentioned above, we study their respective treatment of the different lockdown and unlock periods declared by the Government of India. Additionally, we compare their projections based on reported data, with special emphasis on how the models deal with (if they do, at all) under-reporting and under-detection of COVID-cases, which has been a major point of discussion in the scientific community, particularly for India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We also compare the uncertainty associated with the projections across the models which is often overlooked in the literature.</p>
              <p id="Par17">The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In <italic>Section 2</italic> we provide an overview of the various models considered in our analysis. The supplement has detailed discussion on the formulation, assumptions and estimation methods utilized by each of the models. We present the numerical findings of our comparative investigation of the models in <italic>Section 3</italic> by comparing projected COVID-counts (i.e., case and death counts associated with COVID-19) and (wherever possible) parameter estimates which help understand transmission dynamics of the pandemic. Next, in <italic>Section 4</italic> we discuss sensitivity analyses and note applications of the models studied in the context of data from countries other than India. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings in <italic>Section 5</italic>.</p>

                    <p id="Par33">This model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] extends the classic SEIR model to estimate COVID-related transmission parameters, in addition to projecting COVID-19 case counts, while accounting for pre-symptomatic infectiousness, time-varying ascertainment rates (i.e. reporting rates), transmission rates and population movements. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> provides a schematic diagram of the compartments and transitions conceptualized in this model. The model includes seven compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), pre-symptomatic infectious (P), reported infectious (I), unreported infectious (A), isolation in hospital (H) and removed (R). Compared with the classic SEIR model, SAPHIRE explicitly models population movement and introduce two additional compartments (A and H) to account for the fact that only reported cases would seek medical care and thus be quarantined by hospitalization. The model described and implemented here relies on the same methodology and arguments as presented by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The only difference is that while the original model analyzed data from China over a time period of December 2019 to March 2020 (which constituted the initial days of the pandemic in China), we analyze data from India. Additionally, the original manuscript adjusted the model to account for population movement. Data on population movement not being available consistently over time and regions in India, we make no such modifications. We further note that the SAPHIRE model returns reported and unreported cumulative COVID-case counts, in addition to cumulative counts of the removed compartment. As such, for the purpose of comparisons, the SAPHIRE model is used only to study cumulative COVID-case counts (reported and unreported).

Compartment <italic>P</italic> contains both reported and unreported cases in the pre-symptomatic phase. We set the transmissibility of <italic>P</italic> to be the same as unreported cases, because it has previously been reported that the majority of cases are unreported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

Since pre-symptomatic infectiousness was estimated to account for 44% of the total infections from reported cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], we set the mean of total infectious period as (<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> + <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) = <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>/0.44 = 5.2 days, assuming constant infectiousness across the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases of reported cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] – thus the mean symptomatic infectious period was <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = 2.9 days. We set a long isolation period of <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> = 17 days, based on a study investigating hospitalisation of COVID-19 patients in the state of Karnataka [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

                    <title>Overview</title>
                    <p id="Par38">One of the problems with applying a standard SIR model in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is the presence of a long incubation period. As a result, extensions of SIR model like the SEIR model are more applicable. In the previous subsection, we have seen an extension which includes the ‘pre-symptomatic infectious’ compartment (people who are infected at time t and contributing to the spread of the virus, but do not show any symptom yet). In the SEIR-fansy model, we use an alternate formulation by defining an ‘untested infectious’ compartment for infected people who are spreading infection but are not tested after the incubation period. This compartment is necessary because there is a large proportion of infected people who are not being tested (a part of them are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic but for a country like India there are other reasons like access to care and stigma that can prevent someone from getting tested/diagnosed). We have assumed that after the ‘exposed’ compartment, a person enters either the ‘untested infectious’ compartment or the ‘tested infectious’ compartment. To incorporate the possible effect of misclassifications due to imperfect testing, we include a compartment for false negatives (infected people who are tested but reported as negative). As a result, after being tested, an infected person enters either into the ‘false negative’ compartment or the ‘tested positive’ compartment (infected people who are tested and reported to be positive). We keep separate compartments for the recovered and deceased persons coming from the untested and false negatives compartments which are ‘recovered unreported’ and ‘deceased unreported’ respectively. For the ‘tested positive’ compartment, the recovered and the death compartments are denoted by ‘recovered reported’ and ‘deceased reported’ respectively. Thus, we divide the entire population into ten main compartments: S (Susceptible), E (Exposed), T (Tested), U (Untested), P (Tested positive), F (Tested False Negative), RR (Reported Recovered), RU (Unreported Recovered), DR (Reported Deaths) and DU (Unreported Deaths). This model is implemented using the R package SEIRfansy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>

                    <p id="Par39">Like most compartmental models, this model assumes exponential times for the duration of an individual staying in a compartment. For simplicity, we approximate this continuous-time process by a discrete-time modeling process. The main parameters of this model are <italic>β</italic> (rate of transmission of infection by false negative individuals), <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> (scaling factor that measures the rate of spread of infection by patients who test positive for COVID-19 relative to infected patients who return false negative test results), <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>u</italic></sub> (scaling factor for the rate of spread of infection by untested individuals), <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> (incubation period in days), <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> (mean days till recovery for positive individuals), <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> (mean number of days for the test result to come after a person is being tested), <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> (death rate due to COVID-19 which is the inverse of the average number of days for death due to COVID-19 starting from the onset of disease multiplied by the probability death of an infected individual due to COVID), <italic>λ</italic> and <italic>μ</italic> (natural birth and death rates respectively, assumed to be equal for the sake of simplicity), <italic>r</italic> (probability of being tested for infectious individuals), <italic>f</italic> (false negative probability of RT-PCR test), <inline-formula id="IEq23"><alternatives><tex-math id="M81">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The number of individuals at the time point <italic>t</italic> in each compartment is governed by the system of differential equations given by Eqs. (<xref rid="Equ17" ref-type="">8a</xref>) – (<xref rid="Equ25" ref-type="">8i</xref>). To simplify this model, we assume that testing is instantaneous. In other words, we assume there is no time difference from the onset of the disease after the incubation period to getting test results. This is a reasonable assumption to make as the time for testing is about 1–2 days which is much less than the mean duration of stay for the other compartments. Further, once a person shows symptoms for COVID-19 like diseases, they are sent to get tested almost immediately. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> provides a schematic overview of the model.

The model defines a renewal equation using the time-varying reproduction number <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> to generate new infections. As a lot of cases in SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic and reported case data is unreliable especially in early part of the epidemic in India, the model relies on observed deaths data and calculates backwards to infer the true number of infections. The latent daily infections are modeled as the product of <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> with a discrete convolution of the previous infections, weighted using an infection-to-transmission distribution specific to SARS-CoV-2. We implement this Bayesian semi-mechanistic model in the context of COVID-19 data arising from India in order to estimate the reproduction number over time, along with plausible upper and lower bounds (95% Bayesian credible intervals (CrI)) of the daily infections and the daily number of infectious people. We parametrize <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> with a fixed effect and a random effect for each week over the course of the epidemic for each state. The fixed effect accounts for the variations in <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> across India as a whole whereas the random effect allows for variations among different states. The weekly effects are encoded as a random walk, where at each successive step the random effect has an equal chance of moving upwards or downwards from its current value. The model is implemented using epidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], a general purpose R package for semi-mechanistic Bayesian modelling of epidemics. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> represents a schematic overview of the model.

                <p id="Par59">Higher values of Rel-MSPE(B:A) indicate better performance of model B over model A. Since the baseline model yields projections of cumulative reported cases, we compute Rel-MSPE for the other models with respect to the baseline model for reported cumulative cases. Projections from ICM represent total (i.e., sum of reported and unreported) cumulative cases and are left out of this comparison of reported counts. For cumulative reported deaths, we compute Rel-MSPE of the SEIR-fansy and ICM models relative to the eSIR model. In addition to comparing the accuracy of fits that arise from the different models, we also investigate if projections from the different models are correlated with observed data. We use the standard Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] as summary measures to study said correlation. Higher values of these correlation metrics indicate better concordance of model projections and the observed data from the test period. Rel-MSPE and correlation metrics are presented in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Since we have projections for total (sum of reported and unreported cases) for active cases from SEIR-fansy, for cumulative cases from SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM, and for cumulative deaths from SEIR-fansy, we present the projected totals along with 95% credible intervals and associated underreporting factors on three specific dates – October 31, November 30 and December 31 in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>.

                <p id="Par61">From Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, we compare the mean of the time-varying effective reproduction number <italic>R</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) over the four phases of lockdown and subsequent unlock phased in India. The eSIR model returns a mean value of 2.08 (95% credible interval: 1.41–2.12) over the entire training period. Factoring in different levels of government interventions which modified transmission dynamics during lockdown, we get period specific estimates ranging from 2.12 (1.44–2.16) in lockdown phase 1, which drops to 1.48 (1.00–1.51) in lockdown phase 2 and then reports a steady decline over the subsequent lockdown and unlock phases. The mean values returned by the SAPHIRE model varied from 2.54 (2.41–2.74) during phase 1 of the lockdown, 1.60 (1.36–2.17) for phase 2, 1.69 (1.46–1.97) for phase 3 and 1.54 (1.29–2.00) for the fourth and final lockdown phase. The estimated values for subsequent unlock phases are quite close to each other, starting from 1.27 (1.19–1.32) in unlock phase 1 and dropping to 1.09 (0.91–1.69) in the fifth unlock phase. The SEIR-fansy notes that the mean <italic>R</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) drops from 5.03 (5.01–5.04) during the first phase of lockdown, to 1.90 (1.89–1.91) during the second lockdown phase, before rising again to 2.33 (2.30–2.36) during lockdown phase 4. The estimated mean drops steadily from 1.80 (1.79–1.81) during unlock phase 2 to 0.86 (0.85–0.87) during unlock phase 5. The ICM-based mean values fluctuate, from 1.77 (1.58–1.96) during the first lockdown phase, followed by 1.22 (1.18–1.27), then dropping to 1.33 (1.28–1.38) and finally rising to 1.41 again (1.35–1.47) for the fourth phase of lockdown. Estimates from ICM during unlock phases behave like those from the SEIR-fansy model – in unlock phase 2 the estimated mean is 1.11 (1.08–1.14) and in unlock phase 5, the mean is 0.83 (0.82–0.84). In terms of agreement of reported values, SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM report the highest mean R for phase one of the lockdown. Values reported by SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM report a drop in intermediate lockdown phases, followed by a rise. Values during unlock period increase from phase 1 to phase 2, followed by a steady decline. SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM report the lowest value of R for unlock phase 5.</p>

While the observed counts decrease steadily in the test period, the eSIR model fails to capture this behaviour and returns projections which rise over time. In comparison, the SEIR-fansy model is able to replicate the decreasing behaviour but yields projections which are higher than observed counts. In terms of prediction accuracy, the SEIR-fansy model has an SMAPE value of 35.14% and an MSRPE value of 1.11. For eSIR model, those values are at 37.96% (SMAPE) and 2.28 (MSRPE).

It is necessary to design and implement a sensitivity analysis focusing on various combinations of the parameters that were previously fixed. The details of the sensitivity analyses are described in detail in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The basic findings from the sensitivity analyses are summarized as follows. We observe that the predictions for the reported active cases (<italic>P</italic>) remains same for all parameter choices. The estimates for <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> mainly differ in the first period, although some variation is noted for the second period as well. However, the estimated <italic>R</italic> are almost the same for the later stages of the pandemic in the different models. For the untested cases, in some of the settings of our analysis, there are substantial deviations from the true numbers. The total number of active cases (which include both the unreported and the reported cases) also varies substantially with different parameter values. Consequently, we note how the estimation of unreported cases is sensitive to different choices for the parameter values.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par76">In this comparative paper we have described five different models of various stochastic structures that have been used for modeling SARS-Cov-2 disease transmission in various countries across the world. We applied them to a case-study in modeling the full disease transmission of the coronavirus in India. While simulation studies are the only gold standard way to compare the accuracy of the models, here we were uniquely poised to compare the projected case-counts and death-counts against observed data on a test period. We learned several things from these models. While the estimation of the reproduction number is relatively robust across the models, the prediction of active and cumulative number of cases and cumulative deaths show variation across models. Our findings in terms of estimates of <italic>R</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) are reflective of the national and state-level implementations of four lockdown phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] which are summarized in Supplementary Table S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>. The largest variability across models is observed in predicting the “total” number of infections including reported and unreported cases. The degree of underreporting has been a major concern in India and other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. We note from Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> that the underreporting factor from SAPHIRE is much higher than those reported by SEIR-fansy and ICM. This may be attributed to the fact that SEIR-fansy and ICM both fit daily reported deaths with a pre-specified death rate (which is higher than that for unreported cases), SAPHIRE does not include daily reported death counts in the likelihood function. Additionally, SEIR-fansy also considered the false positive/negative rates of tests and the selection bias in testing, which also contribute to more accurate unreported case projections along with untested infectious case counts. With a comprehensive exposition and a single beta-testing case-study we hope this paper will be useful to understand the mathematical nuance and the differences in terms of deliverables for the models.</p>
              <p id="Par77">There are several limitations to this work. First and foremost, all model estimates are based on a scenario where we assumed no change in either interventions or behavior of people in the forecast period. This is not true as there is tremendous variation in policies across Indian states in the post lockdown phase. We did observe regional lockdowns that were enacted in the forecast period. None of our models tried to capture this variability. Second, the five models we compare are a subset of a vast amount of work that has been done in this area, including models that incorporate age-specific contact network and spatiotemporal variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Third, we have not tested the models for predicting the oscillatory growth and decay behavior of the virus incidence curve, in particular, predicting the second wave. Finally, an extensive simulation study would be the best way to assess the models under different scenarios, but we have restricted our attention to India.</p>
