                <p id="Par1">As the global pandemic of the COVID-19 continues, the statistical modeling and analysis of the spreading process of COVID-19 have attracted widespread attention. Various propagation simulation models have been proposed to predict the spread of the epidemic and the effectiveness of related control measures. These models play an indispensable role in understanding the complex dynamic situation of the epidemic. Most existing work studies the spread of epidemic at two levels including population and agent. However, there is no comprehensive statistical analysis of community lockdown measures and corresponding control effects. This paper performs a statistical analysis of the effectiveness of community lockdown based on the Agent-Level Pandemic Simulation (ALPS) model. We propose a statistical model to analyze multiple variables affecting the COVID-19 pandemic, which include the timings of implementing and lifting lockdown, the crowd mobility, and other factors. Specifically, a motion model followed by ALPS and related basic assumptions is discussed first. Then the model has been evaluated using the real data of COVID-19. The simulation study and comparison with real data have validated the effectiveness of our model.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Since January 2020, the Lancet have published many papers and reviews that have revealed the high mortality rate and person-to-person transmission characteristics of the new coronavirus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As the global pandemic of COVID-19 is still happening around the world, it is vital to prevent the spread of the epidemic by implementing control measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. There are many types of control measures, including community blockade, wearing masks, body temperature checking, access restrictions, traffic control, real names and ID numbers for censorship and surveillance, and so on. However, there is no consensus on the effectiveness of these measures. From the perspective of the growth rate of the epidemic, Wang et al. evaluated the effectiveness of control measures by establishing a dynamic model of development of the epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. They pointed out that if the government did not take control measures, as of February 18, 2020, the number of existing infected people across the country would reach 16.98 million to 76.11 million. If the control measures are postponed one day, the number of existing infected persons will reach 27,000 higher than the actual number. If the control measures are postponed one week, the number of existing infected persons would be 785,000 higher. Maier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] further confirmed that control measures could change the exponential growth rate of the development of the epidemic significantly. Hernandez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] used ARIMA models and polynomial functions for analyzing the relation between COVID-19 behavior and population in a region. Research on the spread of COVID-19 is a global task. Catelli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] proposed a multi-lingual system in response to the low-resource language scenario. Ma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] built an artificial city in a simulated environment based on the ACP method, analyzed the impact on the development of the epidemic when implementing different control measures for different places, and pointed out that inspection and quarantine and self-protection can only delay the arrival of the peak of infection. A complete blockade is the only way to stop the spread of the epidemic. However, current research on the effectiveness of the control measures most focuses on the macroscopic growth situation in large regions and even the entire country. There are three types of epidemic models below: 
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par3"><bold>Compartmental Models</bold>. Compartmental Models divide the total population into different warehouses according to their different states. The process of epidemic spreading is abstracted as the population movements between different warehouses. Such models include the SIR model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and the SI model, the SIS model, the SEIR model, and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par4"><bold>Logistic Growth Models</bold>. Logistic Growth Models were originally used to simulate population growth in a limited environment. They were subsequently applied in the simulation of infectious disease epidemic dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par5"><bold>Network Models</bold>. In Network Models, network nodes are used to represents in the population, and the network structure interconnections are used to simulate the relationship between individuals. Network models were used to study the law of the spread of an epidemic in a population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="Par6">Although these models are applicable to assess the macro situation of the epidemic, lacking the accurate description of the state of each individual in the population makes these models unsuitable for the accurate simulation of the spread of an epidemic in the community. There is no effective method for fine-grained evaluation of control measures in small areas such as residential communities. It is important to simulate the spread of the epidemic at the community level. But there is a class of epidemic models that offers the possibility of overcoming this limitation, called Agent-based Models. Agent-based models track the spread of epidemic at the individual level and simulate the complex interaction factors between individuals. Among them are the ALPS model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and BioWar model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">This paper studies real data of COVID-19 and proposes a model based on the ALPS to simulate the spread of the epidemic in the community. We have performed a quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed model. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. SectionÂ <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> introduces the underlying assumptions and motion models of the ALPS model first. The COVID19_ALPS model and its implementation details are proposed subsequently. SectionÂ <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">3</xref> presents the simulation results of the COVID19_ALPS model under different experimental settings and evaluates the comparison with real data from Wuhan, China. The paper ends by summarizing the advantages of the proposed model and suggesting improvements in the future.</p>

                <p id="Par8">Hunter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] believed that the models relating to the spread of epidemics through human contacts can be broadly categorized into two main classes, population-level coarse modeling and agent-level modeling. Compartmental models and network models are the representatives of the former. The population-level coarse modeling sets consistent parameters for all individuals in the same population, which is a typical top-down method. While the population level dynamical evolutions of population variables are simple and very effective for the overall assessment, they do not take into account any social dynamics, human behavior, government-mandated restrictions, and complexities of human interactions explicitly.</p>
                <p id="Par9">Agent-based modeling is a bottom-up approach, which is the opposite of Population-level coarse modeling. Agents are artificial individuals programmed to perform pre-defined operations. They operate based on their behavior, interact with the environment, collaborate or compete with each other agents. With this characteristic, it is possible to visualize the behaviors of agents as a physical system, such as simulations of evacuations, traffic, biological systems, infections, etc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, we can treat the individual as an agent in the simulation. The models that study these human-level factors and variables while tracking disease at an individual level are called agent-based models. The advantages are that they are more detailed, and one can vary the parameters of restriction measures, such as social distancing, at a granular level to infer overall outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par10">Agent-based models have wide applications in the transmission of epidemics, but these models have different implementation details. This phenomenon means that many agent-based models are fundamentally different. We collect some representative references, as shown in TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The characteristic information in each reference is presented separately, including authors and date (A &amp; D), the interaction between agents (Interaction), the number of agent states (States), focus on the epidemic (Epidemic), and the simulated environment (Environment).

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par12"><bold>Most Agent-based models divide agent states based on the compartmental model</bold> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Compartmental models such as SI, SIR, and SEIR divide the population into fixed categories, including Susceptible(S), Exposed(E), Infected(I), and Removed(R). This makes agent states simple and clear enough to avoid the uncertain factors of the fuzzy state. However, simple state division may not be sufficient to meet the requirements of accurate simulation.

Therefore, the model for studying these diseases uses the Contact network, mobile model, and behavior model as the interaction between agents. These interactions are based on the agentâs movement in the simulated environment, which is conducive to calculating the distance between the agents to determine whether it is infected. HIV and syphilis are spread through sexual activity. At this time, it is meaningless to calculate the spatial distance between agents. The most important thing is to judge whether they have intimacy, skin contact, or blood contact through social events.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par15"><bold>The simulated environment is diverse</bold>. The scale of the simulated environment can be divided into three levels: facilities, urban area, and society. These environments are represented by two-dimensional spaces with clear boundaries, length, and width. In addition, there is a special kind of environment called social networks. The social network model does not calculate the agentâs movement but simulates the agentâs interaction through the links between network nodes.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par16"><bold>Data-driven is the leading cause of the difference</bold>. Researchers used different data in different studies. Models are data-sensitive and different data leads to diverse structures. Objectively, this makes data-driven models extremely demanding on the data used. For example, in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], the authors suggest that their work requires four types of data, including location-specific data, physiological data, the data related to COVID-19 disease, and smartphone-related statistics. However, other studies use completely different data, such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], call detail records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], land use statistics, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

Although many researchers use agent-based methods to study COVID-19, their concerns are not the same. The most common metrics in these studies are infection rate, recovery rate, and mortality rate. On the other hand, some researchers have focused on the intensive care unit (ICU)-bed occupancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and economic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p>

In reality, COVID-19 patients will experience a variety of intermediate states in the process, from health to recovery/death. There are seven states in our proposed model: Healthy (Susceptible), Incubation, Asymptomatic, Mild and Common, Severe and Critical, Recovery and Death.

However, we believe that the impact of community scale cannot be ignored and make a thorough study on it. According to the national standard (<italic>Urban Residential District Planning and Design Standard GB50180-2018</italic>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> published by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the Peopleâs Republic of China in July 2018, the scale of urban communities and the corresponding information are shown in TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. In order to facilitate subsequent model calculations, the relevant parameters here are all calculated as minimum values. Since the specific number of residential units in the community is not given, this study assumes each residential unit is 10 stories high, 2 households on each floor, and 3 persons per household. The number of residential units in the community is obtained according to the total population in the community. In order to facilitate the evenly distributed processing of the residential units in the simulation, the nearest perfect square number is taken as the number of residential units. Due to the large scale of the 15-minute pedestrian-scale community whose simulation requires a lot of computational resources, it will not be analyzed in this study for the time being. Relevant experiments are carried out around 10-minute pedestrian-scale communities, 5-minute pedestrian-scale communities, and neighborhood block.

                <p id="Par68">The moving speed of residents is determined by the motion model described by (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>). This study evaluates the impact of residentsâ moving speed and community scale on the spread of COVID-19 through four indicators:

The experiment results are shown in TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. When the community is set as a 10-minute pedestrian-scale community, due to the large scale of the community, the spread of COVID-19 has not ended until the end of the simulation.

Although there is only one infected person initially, the infections will reach the maximum after 35 to 45 days without any lockdown. After 100 days, about 5% to 6% of the community population will die of infecting the COVID-19. It should be noted that as the simulation enter the middle stage or late stage, most of the infected people have healed or passed away. However, a small amount of healthy agents just begin to be infected during these stages. Although the maximum proportion of infection is about 98%. In fact, there are no uninfected residents in the community at the end of the simulation. From the perspective of the entire simulation, the infection rate can be approximated as 100%.

                <p id="Par75">Without the lockdown, the scale of the community has no significant impact on the spread of COVID-19. At the same speed, the larger the community, the longer it will take for the COVID-19 to spread. This characteristic means that COVID-19 break out in small areas is more rapid and difficult to control. In contrast, it will take longer for COVID-19 to spread in large and medium-sized areas before having the base of the outbreak. It will provide a rare opportunity for the implementation of anti-epidemic measures.</p>

The simulation results of our model are shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. When <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> =â5, the peak of the proportion of the infected people is 5.8%, 87.7% of the residents in the whole community are uninfected, the recovered population accounted for 6.4%, and the mortality rate of the whole community is only 0.1%.

When <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> is 20 and 30, the COVID-19 has already spread widely before the lockdown and accumulated enough numbers of the infected population to an outbreak.

Some residents in the community who can move freely after the lockdown, which will lead to the breakthrough of the lockdown. This result emphasizes the necessity of strict restriction of population mobility. It will become the breakthrough for the spread of the COVID-19 even if only a small number of people move.

                  <p id="Par80">We discuss this in two situations. When <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> is less than or equal to 10, the effect of lockdown mainly depends on when the lockdown is lifted (<italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>). The benefits of early lockdown will be invalidated after it is lifted. Once the lockdown is lifted, the proportion of the infected people will begin to rise. The sooner the lockdown is lifted, the more complex the situation of the COVID-19 will be. When <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> is greater than or equal to 15, the effect of lockdown mainly depends on <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>. The later the lockdown starts, the worse the spread of the COVID-19. Since the COVID-19 has a wider spread before lockdown, people have already gathered around the living units, although the lockdown has restricted the movement of residents to a smaller extent. If the proportion of infected residents breaks through a critical point, the lockdown will only have a weak control effect. In the worst case, the result will even be equivalent to the situation without lockdown measures.</p>

                <title>Model validation</title>
                <p id="Par81">Hunter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] proposed several ways to validate a simulation model. Many references mentioned above also confirm the rationality of these verifications. The obvious way is to use real data as the baseline. The effectiveness of the model is verified by comparing simulation results with real data. Parameter settings and assumptions can be checked through residual analysis. Our verification requires a variety of real data, including the real size of the community, the houseunits and their distribution, the number of residents, the number of infections/recoveries/deaths per day, and other necessary data. However, the government and related agencies currently do not release community-level data for COVID-19. Therefore, we derive community-level data from macro statistics released by WHO and NHC. In the absence of necessary real data, this verification is temporarily unavailable.</p>
                <p id="Par82">The other verification is to compare with the proven models. The SI model, SIR model, and their variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] are suitable options. Although these compartmental models cannot provide simulation results on the agent level, they can still be used as control experiments for the population level. We take this verification and further supplement the comparative experiment.</p>
                <p id="Par83">Compartmental models simplify the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. Some agent-based models are compared with compartmental models such as SIR because they have the same state settings (Susceptible (S), Infected (I), Removed (R) et al.). Considering the settings of our model, the most suitable compartment model is the SEIR model (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). The population is assigned to compartments with four labels, including Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), and Removed (R). In the COVID19_ALPS model, the counts for recovered and dead are kept separate, while in the SEIR model, these two categories are combined as removed (final state without contagious). Under normal circumstances, the SEIR model does not consider vital dynamics, which means no births or deaths in a closed population (the total population N is a constant). The SEIR model is defined by (<xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">3</xref>), where <italic>N</italic> = <italic>S</italic> + <italic>E</italic> + <italic>I</italic> + <italic>R</italic>. In particular, the exposed agents are not contagious in the SEIR model.

References [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] use agent-based models to research COVID-19, and their results are worth learning. Among them, reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] proposes an agent-based model that simulates the spread</p>
                <p id="Par90">of COVID-19 among the inhabitants of a city. We tentatively set the parameters based on data from China to make the model run. The parameters are set as follows.

Therefore, their model can simulate city-level data well, but there is no evidence that it can process community-level data. Combining the work of both will be interesting research in the future.

                <p id="Par95">The paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] proposes the COVID-ABS, a new SEIR agent-based model that aims to simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people, business, and government. Due to the consideration of the economic factors, the simulation model of this work is very complicated and involves many parameters. Seven different scenarios of social distancing interventions were analyzed: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. Only Scenario (1) and Scenario (2) are relevant to our study. In Scenario (2), the author forced all agents to stop moving from <italic>t</italic> =â0 to T during the simulation. The experimental result is almost a straight line, which means that there are no new infections, and only the initial infected agents gradually recover or died. This result is in line with the facts, but it is different from our work. Therefore, Scenario (1) is the only thing we need to discuss. The results shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref> prove the effectiveness of our model. The curve shapes of the simulation results of both of us are highly similar. Since COVID-ABS considers complicated schedules, their result curve is jagged. Our model can achieve the same result with a more straightforward design, which is an advantage that cannot be ignored.

                <p id="Par96">In a nutshell, it is still a complex problem to verify the agent-based model. Most researchers put forward agent-based simulation based on some special conditions to analyze the influence of variables in an ideal environment. This leads to the lack of suitable real data for these studies, and it is not easy to compare different simulations with each other. Nevertheless, the agent-based simulation model provides valuable forward-looking explorations for many real-world scenarios, important for governments and their staff.</p>

                <title>Comparison with real data in Wuhan and other cities in China</title>
                <p id="Par97">COVID19_ALPS has constructed an enclosed environment. The typical real case is the early stage of the COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. The local government of Wuhan closed all types of exits on January 23, 2020. The lockdown on Wuhan lasted for 76 days until April 8, 2020, and was gradually lifted and resumed. The lockdown of communities was implemented on February 10, 2020. Therefore, Wuhan can be considered as a large-scale closed community, which well matches the assumptions of the COVID19_ALPS model. January 23 is regarded as the starting time of the simulation in our model. The mandatory homestay implemented on February 10 means <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> =â18. The lockdown measures were lifted on April 8, which is considered as <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>. The cut-off time is May 1 and the length of <italic>T</italic> is 100 days.</p>
                <p id="Par98">It can be seen that the time of Wuhanâs lockdown of communities <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> is 18, which is larger than the critical value <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> =â10. Wuhan had 495 confirmed patients on January 23, which was larger than the COVID19_ALPS simulation. Therefore, the outbreak in Wuhan came earlier and lasted longer. Combining the COVID19_ALPS model and the real situation in Wuhan, we believe that the COVID-19 in Wuhan would show an exponential growth trend from the 5<sup><italic>t</italic><italic>h</italic></sup> day to 30<sup><italic>t</italic><italic>h</italic></sup> day, and the number of infections would reach the maximum near the 45<sup><italic>t</italic><italic>h</italic></sup> day. The epidemic data in Wuhan confirms this conclusion, which is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>. From January 26 to February 20, the number of people infected in Wuhan rose rapidly from 698 to 45,027. Subsequently, the growth of infections slowed down. On March 13, the number of infections reached 49,991. The growth of COVID-19 almost stagnated since then. Therefore, March 13 can be regarded as a peak of infection in the Wuhan epidemic, and 50 days have passed since January 23. We need to point out that the number of infected, cured, and deaths in Wuhan on April 18 in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref> changed slightly. This is not due to the rebound of COVID-19 after the lockdown measures were lifted. It is because of the data correction carried out by the local government.
<fig id="Fig14"><label>Fig. 14</label><caption><p>Daily epidemic in Wuhan from January 23, 2020 to May 1, 2020</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10489_2021_2615_Fig14_HTML" id="MO14"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par99">In addition, we count the number of COVID-19 infections in ten cities during the same period. These cities are divided into two types: those close to Wuhan and other representative cities. The former includes Ezhou, Huanggang, Jingzhou, and Xiaogan. In Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref> we show the changing process of the number of infections in these ten cities from January 23, 2020, to May 1, 2020. On the right side of the figure, we count the length of time between January 23, 2020, when the infected person reaches the maximum. The orange part represents the four cities close to Wuhan, and their data is greater than 30 days, which means that the spread of COVID-19 in these cities is severe. The remaining cities are far away from Wuhan, and the spread of COVID-19 is restricted more quickly. What needs to be pointed out is that Shenzhen and Guangzhou, as port cities, have experienced a second increase in the number of infected people. Our modelâs judgment on the spread of COVID-19 has also been verified on the data of these cities.

                <p id="Par100">In summary, the COVID19_ALPS model proposed in this research can be well adapted to real scenarios. The model can be used as a reference for epidemic prevention and control. It will help decision-makers understand the growth situation of the epidemic and the timing of implementing or lifting lockdown measures.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par101">This study has performed a quantitative evaluation on the effectiveness of the community lockdown through the COVID-19_ALPS model. We analyze the factors that affect the spread of COVID-19, including population mobility, community scale, the timings of implementing and lifting lockdown measures, etc. The appropriate parameter settings and the succinct assumptions make the COVID19_ALPS model efficient in simulation. The comparison with real data verifies the effectiveness of this model. The results reveal that: 
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par102">Controlling population mobility is a necessary means of epidemic prevention. A tiny number of floating populations will cause the epidemic prevention to fall short of expectations.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par103">Implementing a lockdown earlier will significantly limit the spread of the epidemic. Moreover, once the lockdown measures are implemented, they should not be lifted prematurely.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par104">The movement of the population must be gradually restored when the situation is preventable and controllable.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="Par105">However, there are still some limitations. The course of COVID-19 patients in the real world is far more complicated than hypothetical conditions. Patients in different disease states have mutual conversion. Community boundaries are usually not regular rectangles, and the distribution of residential units is not uniform, and so on. In particular, it should be pointed out that the assessment obtained by COVID19_ALPS is relatively conservative. In the future, more settings can be incorporated to make the model closer to the real world.</p>
