              <abstract>
                <p>Typhoid fever affects 21 million people globally, 1% of whom succumb to the disease. The social, economic and public health consequences of this disease disproportionately affect people in Africa and Asia. In order to design context specific prevention strategies, we need to holistically characterise outbreaks in these settings. In this study, we used retrospective data (2013–2016) at national and district level to characterise temporal and spatial dynamics of Typhoid fever outbreaks using time series and spatial analysis. We then selected cases matched with controls to investigate household socio-economic drivers using a conditional logistic regression model, and also developed a Typhoid fever outbreak-forecasting framework. The incidence rate of Typhoid fever at national and district level was ~ 160 and 60 cases per 100,000 persons per year, respectively, predominantly in urban areas. In Kasese district, Bwera sub-county registered the highest incidence rate, followed by Kisinga, Kitholhu and Nyakiyumbu sub-counties. The male-female case ratio at district level was at 1.68 and outbreaks occurred between the 20<sup>th</sup> and 40<sup>th</sup> week (May and October) each year following by seven weeks of precipitation. Our forecasting framework predicted outbreaks better at the district level rather than national. We identified a temporal window associated with Typhoid fever outbreaks in Kasese district, which is preceded by precipitation, flooding and displacement of people. We also observed that areas with high incidence of Typhoid fever also had high environmental contamination with limited water treatment. Taken together with the forecasting framework, this knowledge can inform the development of specific control and preparedness strategies at district and national level.</p>

              <p>Typhoid fever is caused by <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovar Typhi and Paratyphi and affects approximately 21 million people annually of whom 222,000 succumb to the disease [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been estimated that 5.6 billion people are at risk globally [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Improving personal hygiene, environmental sanitation, food and water safety as well as limiting bacterial shedding by infectious individuals form the cornerstone of most control strategies for this disease [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Historically, development of good sewage management systems and water treatment has been credited for drastically reducing the incidence of enteric diseases in western Europe and North America in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The same trend is evident in Latin America and some Asian countries especially when compared with economic development which comes with improved access to water and sanitation [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although there has been significant economic growth in Africa over the same period, the lack of significant investment in public health infrastructure means that the trends in disease incidence are not comparable with other parts of the world [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Countries like Uganda, with very high population growth rate and ample annual precipitation but with inadequate sanitation and safe water access, experience multiple large outbreaks of Typhoid fever every year [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214650.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For example a recently documented Typhoid fever outbreak in the capital city Kampala was attributed to unconfined aquifers and registered 10,230 suspected cases, 1,920 of which were confirmed [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214650.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Kasese is one of the districts with persistent outbreaks of Typhoid fever in Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Reports have suggested that some of the outbreaks can last as long as two years such as the one between 2007 and 2009. The outbreak spilled over into neighbouring districts like Bundibugyo and was detected after an influx in patients with intestinal perforations [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214650.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The impact of such an outbreak causes large economic losses to already impoverished communities with approximately US$58 being spent on the treatment of an uncomplicated case, and going up to US$155 for those with intestinal perforations [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is critical to understand the drivers of such Typhoid fever outbreaks at various levels in order to inform the development and implementation of targeted public health interventions. In this study we used retrospective data (2013–2016) at national and district level to examine temporal and spatial dynamics of Typhoid fever outbreaks. Furthermore, we selected cases and controls to investigate household socio-economic drivers of Typhoid fever and developed an outbreak-forecasting framework.</p>

Informed consent was obtained before a case was included in the household level study. Each case was matched to two controls geographically, by age and sex. The controls lived in the same residential area (village) as the case i.e. shared municipal amenities like water source, hospitals and markets. For controls to be selected they a) must have been resident in the same village as the case during the outbreaks; b) must not have been or had cases in their households and c) controls had to be consenting adults (≥18 years). Furthermore, regarding criterion b, we asked the control if they or any member of their household had had Typhoid fever within the last one-year period. A structured questionnaire was then administered to both cases and controls households to investigate personal hygiene, environmental sanitation, water and food safety practices and socio-economics in each of these households to generate the HOUSEHOLD_DATASET.</p>

The trend shows that each year Kasese district experiences Typhoid fever outbreaks between weeks 20 and 40. We observed other outbreaks before and after this twenty-week window. For example in 2013, an outbreak occurred between weeks 40 and 52 and the outbreak at the end of 2015 spilled over into January 2016. The subsequent outbreaks in 2016 were small in size but occurred throughout the year. In general, the trends at national level mirror those observed in Kasese district. In contrast, the largest outbreak at national level was observed in mid-2016. When we compared the trends between cases and the weather pattern in Kasese district, we observed that the spike in Typhoid fever cases in June and October 2014 coincided with precipitation and increased humidity. In contrast, the spike in Typhoid fever cases in July and October 2015 did not coincide with precipitation and humidity and the same was true for the spike at the end of that year. Indeed, the cross-correlation analysis between Typhoid fever cases and precipitation showed a negative correlation with a 0.15 (7 weeks) lag between precipitation and case reporting. The relationship with temperature cyclic i.e. both positively and negatively correlated with lags before and after case reporting (Figs C and D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214650.s001">S1 File</xref><bold>).</bold></p>

                <p>The case control survey gathered information from 201 households, with an average household membership of 7.45, therefore a population of ~ 1500 person was investigated. The median age of cases and controls was 36 years (range 18–84). It is worth noting that the “adult consenting age” was one of our selection criteria (Figs E and F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214650.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The public health burden of diseases like Typhoid fever disproportionately affects people in developing countries especially in Africa where the population is projected to hit 2.5 billion by the year 2050 [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214650.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Such countries are also characterised by scarcity of epidemiological data which not only limits our ability to implement robust and targeted control strategies, but also the attainment of health related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In light of the SDGs, it is critical now more than ever to understand outbreaks at all levels and to document context specific drivers in the most affected populations. This seems to be the only cost-effective way to guide the development and implementation of public health interventions. In this study, we used retrospective data at national and district level to examine temporal and spatial dynamics of Typhoid fever outbreaks. Furthermore, we selected cases and controls to investigate household socio-economic drivers in addition to developing Typhoid fever outbreak forecasting models. This multi-method analysis at different administrative levels of the community provides breadth and depth for developing robust strategies that limit the risk of exposure and impact of Typhoid fever on communities.</p>

                <title>Descriptive summary of typhoid fever</title>
                <p>There were 210,204 Typhoid fever cases reported at national level between 2013 and 2016 i.e. ~ 160.1 cases per 100,000 people per year. This estimate not only falls within the range previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] but also supports the continental ranking that puts Uganda, Djibouti, DRC and Tanzania on top [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214650.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In economic terms, even if we took the most conservative disease management estimates as reported by [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], i.e. outpatients without intestinal perforations (IP), the total treatment cost would be ~ $7 million at national level. On the other hand, if we take the estimates for IP and none IP outpatients in Kasese district in this period, the total disease management cost would be ~ $110,000 and $301,676 respectively. This is an enormous financial burden placed on individuals in communities mostly struggling with people displacement and property destruction due to the heavy rains[<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
                <p>Most of the cases in Uganda are predominantly reported in peri-urban settings [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Such settings are characterised by poor personal hygiene, environmental sanitation and limited supply of municipal water, all of which are critical risk factors for Typhoid fever [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It therefore not surprising that the most affected populations in the region are slum dwellers [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214650.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Over the years, there has been a considerable improvement in Typhoid fever surveillance at national level, which is partly due to efforts by Typhoid Surveillance in Africa Programme (TSAP) [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These efforts have however tended to lack granularity about individual outbreaks which makes it difficult to learn from the outbreaks. In this study, we observed that at district level in Kasese, the case distribution was skewed towards the male gender. This gender skew has also been reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214650.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], where it was believed to reflect the disparity in health seeking behaviour between males and females. However, previous studies conducted on gender health seeking behaviour in Uganda have consistently shown that females were better at seeking medical attention than males [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214650.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The observed gender case distribution is therefore likely an indication of intersectionality between masculine roles or activities and the Typhoid fever risk profile.</p>

                <title>Temporal and spatial dynamics of typhoid fever</title>
                <p>A general lack of robust diagnostic capacity in developing countries means that accurate temporal characterisation of gastro-intestinal infections is difficult [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, characterising temporal signatures of Typhoid fever, which can serve as diagnostic correlates within clinical diagnostic algorithms is very essential in these settings. For example, we observed an annual incidence between week 20 and 40 (May and October). Our cross-correlation analysis between weather parameters and cases reported in Kasese district reveal 0.15 (7 weeks) lag between precipitation and case reporting i.e.; an outbreak peak was preceded by a bout of precipitation. On the other hand, this relationship is cyclic for humidity and temperature i.e. a lag before and after onset of cases. It is worth noting that this lag between these weather parameters and onset of disease will be shorter. Such information has potential to improve the efficiency of diagnostic triaging at clinical level in specific hotspot areas of the country. Water is a central factor to Typhoid fever outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], which means that sustained precipitation in settings devoid of efficient drainage systems and water treatment presents considerable risk to its dwellers. Indeed, most reports of Typhoid fever outbreaks have shown a close association between precipitation and outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214650.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In Dhaka for example, the Typhoid fever risk was linked to distance of a case from a water body and river water levels, suggesting that flooding played a role in pathogen dissemination [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>
                <p>Kasese is one of the most flood prone districts in Uganda; in fact this district has experienced flooding in April and May of every year since 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The banks of rivers Nyamwamba, Mubuku and Nyamugasani burst inundated six sub counties i.e. Bulembia, Karusandura, Kyarumba, Nyamwamba and Central division along their paths to Lake Edward and George [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214650.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214650.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These floods have displaced up to 40,000 people in the last four years [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. If we put this in the temporal context characterised in this study, it means that the flooding and displacement of people usually occurs between the 15<sup>th</sup> and 22<sup>nd</sup> week of each year which is ~ 5 weeks before the onset of high Typhoid fever case reporting.</p>
                <p>We observed the highest incidence in Bwera among other sub-counties. Bwera sub-county is predominantly a low altitude urban area with a high population density. Dwellers of Bwera sub-county use municipal water predominantly pumped from rivers and protected springs [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This means that a significant proportion of the population is reliant on water sources whose safety is known to fluctuate with environmental contamination [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214650.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It is therefore more likely that the floods, which follow weeks of heavy precipitation lead to contamination of water sources that potentially overwhelm any water treatment strategies. This would compromise the safety of water available for communities undergoing varying levels of displacement.</p>
                <p>Kisinga, Kagando, Kyondo and Kyarumba sub-counties also had a high incidence of Typhoid fever cases, these sub-counties are close to the main tributaries of River Nyamugasani with the Kisinga and Kagando laying downstream. Literature indicates that a large proportion of the populations living in these two areas have limited access to safe water [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. One can therefore argue that the Typhoid fever risk for these counties were likely modulated by the a) levels of environmental contamination resulting from flooding and b) that outbreaks in Kyondo and Kyarumba upstream of the river Nyamugasani likely play a role in the outbreaks that occur downstream in Kisinga and Kagando. Although this study cannot make this link empirically, the temporal dynamics show that between March and June 2015, the case incidence in Kyondo and Kyarumba was preceded by higher case incidence in Kisinga and Kagando (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214650.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

We started by examining sanitation; where we used <italic>Salmonella</italic> contamination as a microbial proxy for sanitation. The findings do not show any salient difference in <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp contamination between samples collected from households of cases and controls except for drinking water samples. Although not statistically significant, we observed that the proportion of drinking water samples from which <italic>Salmonella</italic> species were isolated was twice as high in cases. Indeed some studies have shown that such characteristics can be an integral part of the household Typhoid fever risk profile [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. For example, only 32.8% of a community in Malawi was found to treat water after it had suffered an outbreak [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Microbial quality of drinking water deteriorates during storage at household level [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214650.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] usually as a function of how water storage receptacles are handled. This could explain why <italic>Salmonella spp</italic> were more prevalent in case households water. In general, sanitation is a product of routine behavioral activities, which in combination with other household, spatial and temporal factors ultimately determined who became a case in a given Typhoid fever outbreak. For example, the conditional logistic regression model shows that water treatment practices were associated with being a case i.e. we found that the odds of being a case were 9.23 higher in those who treated drinking water compared to those who did not treat drinking water. This seems counter intuitive and in disagreement with most studies which have reported water treatment to reduce microbial contamination significantly thus protective of disease [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In this study we visited cases months after treatment, as part of their treatment cases are also sensitized on hygiene and water treatment to avoid future infections. We believe this could explain why more cases appear to treat drinking water than controls. Some studies have also shown that despite proper water treatment, microbial quality of water deteriorates during storage due to handling [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. It is therefore likely that case-household re-contaminated water during storage after treatment; this could explain why we found case households having twice the level of contamination in drinking water when compared to controls. Therefore, adherence to water treatment is critical in such situations [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. This is usually compromised by the complacency due to the belief that clear tap water is safe for consumption in urban settings.</p>
                <p>Most studies have shown age as key factor in driving the risk profile of Typhoid fever in communities [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214650.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and one that can be exploited for targeted control [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214650.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In this study however, because age was part of the selection criterion for cases, there is an inherent bias in the age distribution profile. None the less, our case distribution by age is similar to what was recently reported in a 10 year study conducted in China [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p>

                <title>Temporal forecasting for typhoid fever outbreaks</title>
                <p>Temporal predictions of infectious disease outbreaks can play a central role in informing preparedness and control strategies [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] i.e. surveillance, vaccination and routine clinical planning [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In this study, the forecasting framework that we developed reasonably predicts the spikes in case reporting which we consider as outbreaks in the first quarter of the year 2017 at district level, specifically in the 9<sup>th</sup> week (February-March). Most importantly we were able to forecast the trend in the first quarter both at the district and national level. Such information is not only important for national preparedness in terms of medical consumables to stock but also for allocating scarce resource for districts that are most likely to be adversely affected. There is room to improve the robustness of such models especially as more data is collected through surveillance as shown in a recent comparative study in China [<xref rid="pone.0214650.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p>

                <title>Public health perspective</title>
                <p>A multi-level approach to understanding the dynamics of Typhoid fever outbreaks provides a holistic tool kit to develop and implement synergistic and complementary cost effect ways of prevent spread and or avert socio-economic impact. For example; we used a) a time series analysis which identified annual risk periods between the 20<sup>th</sup>-40<sup>th</sup> week of each year (May to October), b) and a recorded high incidence of Typhoid fever in Bwera, Kisinga, Kagando Kyarumba and Kilembe sub-counties, c) we showed that incidence of these outbreaks is preceded by seven weeks of heavy precipitation occurring between the 15<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> week (April-May) which are usually followed by people displacement due to flooding. It is important to note the onset of disease is likely much early; and that we used reporting which does not occur in real-time. By including a case-control study, we also identified household factors such as water treatment and hygiene practices as well as contamination levels. Such a multi-level risk profile can guide preparedness and also facilitate the allocation of scarce resources at district and national level in Uganda. Furthermore, the spatial, temporal and household risk parameters could be exploited to improved clinical diagnostic algorithms at district level.</p>

                <p>We were able to recover only 10% (134/1298) of the national level records at the three hospitals in Kasese. None the less we were able to recruit a sufficient number of cases and controls to allow for a statistically robust association analysis.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Exploiting temporal, spatial and household data at various administrative levels using time series allowed us to characterise Typhoid fever outbreaks with more granularity in Kasese district. We identified a temporal window that is consistently associated with Typhoid fever outbreaks; precipitation, flooding and displacement of people precede this window. Furthermore, these outbreaks were mainly located in a river basin. We also observed that cases are associated with salmonella contamination of drinking water receptacles at household level. In this regard, we have developed a forecasting framework whose utility can be better harnessed at national level. Taken together, this output can play a central role in developing context specific control and preparedness strategies at national and district level.</p>
