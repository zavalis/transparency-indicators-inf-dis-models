          <body>
            <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious global health threat. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic, as it spreads worldwide rapidly following the logistic growth pattern.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> More than 103 million cases were reported worldwide by January 31, 2021, where the United States of America (USA) has over 26.5 million cases alone. The virus that causes the COVID-19 disease is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is spreading very quickly in the human population. The main route of spreading this virus is close person-to-person contact, and the spread is sustainable, as it goes from person-to-person without stopping. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is spreading more efficiently than influenza, but not as efficiently as highly contagious measles.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Another complicating factor is that asymptomatic patients are still able to spread the virus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), common symptoms include but are not limited to fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, sore throat, and many more.</p>
            <p>As infected populations and the death tolls continue to rise rapidly, governments worldwide are trying to control the pandemic by reducing people’s close contact, such as shutting down public places, schools, colleges, universities, restaurants, playgrounds, and the list continues. Due to the lack of proper viral medicine or vaccine, travel bans from highly infected areas, social distancing, lock-down policy, isolation of an infected person, self-quarantine of exposed individual, mandatory use of face masks or face coverings, and strictly following all social-conscious and prevention strategies<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> have been widely used strategies to contain the virus.</p>
            <p>Infectious disease modeling is one of the most critical parts of understanding the current pandemic’s ongoing scenario. Mathematical modeling techniques, particularly the compartmental modeling technique, can help us estimate crucial parameters, such as disease transmission dynamics, number of infected people, number of hospitalized people, and number of recovered/dead individuals. Consequently, it helps to forecast outbreak timelines and the overall dynamics of the disease. The knowledge gained from mathematical modeling helps determine strategies to mitigate the outbreak and determine whether the interventions taken are useful or not.</p>
            <p>The modeling community took the challenge to face the COVID-19 pandemic together. It started modeling to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 and help determine the intervention to slow the spread of the virus. Most of the models related to COVID-19 use population-based, Susceptible-Infected-Removal (SIR) models with differential equations or stochastic differential equations<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> or susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removal (SEIR) and extended SEIR compartmental models.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Some agent-based models developed related to COVID-19 use structured networks to connect individuals and model infection exchanges stochastically.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>
</p>
            <p>Mathematical models often made redundant use of parameters and equations. Our primary focus is to keep the model as easy and straightforward as possible, so it will be understandable to the nonmath major population for a broader perspective. In this study, we develop a deterministic <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline1.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (modified SEIR) model to deepen our understanding of COVID-19’s dynamic. Theoretically, we analyze the model to show the existence and positivity invariance of the system’s solutions and determine the Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE) and Endemic Equilibrium (EE). We calculate the basic reproduction number, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline2.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> by using the next-generation matrix approach. We also analyze the local stability of the DFE and EE fixed points. Finally, we estimate the probability of an outbreak using the Continuous-time Markov Chain (CTMC) model for better prediction to control the disease outbreak.</p>
            <p>We parameterize our model for Texas, United States, by using the data from March 6, 2020, to January 31, 2021, available at <uri xlink:href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/.">https://www.dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/</uri>.<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Using numerical simulations and data analyses, we predict the daily confirmed case and the cumulative case of Texas and compare the model prediction with the existing data.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> We provide a sensitivity and elasticity index analysis of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline3.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> to understand better the most fluctuating (sensitive) parameter of the model. Furthermore, in this study, we developed the CTMC model. We estimate the probability of a disease outbreak depending on the most critical parameter of the model to determine better control measures of the diseases. The main objectives of the study are: (a) We will work with real-life available discrete data of Texas to understand the cases and project the control of the infection; and (b) we expect that the prediction of controlling measure of COVID-19 will be able to validate the dynamics of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline4.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and CTMC models to obtain more accurate results.</p>
            <p>We organized this article as follows: Mathematical Model discussed elaborately with positivity and boundedness of solution in the Mathematical Model and Existence of Solutions section. The fixed points, auxiliary results are described in the Determination of Fixed Points section. The local stability analysis, parameter estimation, and sensitivity analysis described in the Stability Analysis, Parameter Estimation, and Sensitivity section. The data analysis compared with the model solution with further prediction to control the epidemic, as a case study in Texas accomplished in the Numerical Simulation and Results section. The probability of disease outbreak with CTMC analysis presented in the Probability of a Disease Outbreak section. Finally, the Concluding Remarks section outlines the summary and concluding remarks of the results.</p>

              <p>Compared with the SIR epidemic model, the next updated and advanced model is SEIR, which is biologically more feasible in many pandemics and infectious diseases. In this study, we consider the following 4 compartments <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline12.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> mathematical model; a modified version of the typical SEIR model:<disp-formula id="disp3"><label>(2.3)</label><graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_eqn3.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>with initial conditions<disp-formula id="disp4"><label>(2.4)</label><graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_eqn4.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>and<disp-formula id="disp5"><label>(2.5)</label><graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_eqn5.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>
</p>
              <p>Here, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline13.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline14.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> are the number of individuals in the susceptible, asymptomatically infected, symptomatically infected (for simplicity, we will call the symptomatically infected population as an infected population), and removed compartments, respectively, at time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline15.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> per day unit. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline16.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the recruitment number in the susceptible compartment. Natural and disease induced deaths are denoted by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline17.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline18.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, respectively. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline19.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline20.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> are the diseases transmission rates of susceptible individuals with asymptomatically infected and infected ones, respectively, which may cause the transmission of the infection, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline21.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the transition rate from asymptomatically infected to infected compartment and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline22.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> are the recovery rates from asymptomatically infected and infected to removal compartment, respectively. After transmission, a susceptible individual initially becomes asymptomatically infected. As the disease progresses, asymptomatically infected individuals may develop symptoms, and transition from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline23.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline24.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline25.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> or they may never develop symptoms and recover at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline26.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Because the model monitors dynamics of population, it follows that all its dependent variables and parameters, for example, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline27.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline28.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> must be non-negative along with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline29.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> as in the model Equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp3">2.3</xref>)-(<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp5">2.5</xref>).

The magnitude of the elasticity index tells us the importance of the parameter. These measures used to determine the control of the parameters of an epidemic model. More examples can be found in Van den Driessche.<sup><xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> The numerical elasticity index of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline121.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for the baseline parameter values is provided in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>
                <p>We observe that the models’ most critical parameters are the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline122.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline123.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> with the average value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline124.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline125.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (see sensitivity index in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), respectively.

Hence, because at the time of this writing, the COVID-19 vaccine has yet to distributed to a significant number of people, the most effective way to prevent the virus is to maintain social distancing and to use a face mask (recommended by the Eikenberry et al.<sup><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>).</p>

                <p>Similarly, decreasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline161.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline162.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> will shorten the interval between the concurrent waves. However, the total number of cases does not change significantly because of the difference between the wave heads and bottom-lands. It shows fewer cases (159,450) than the base model fitting simulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>b). Again, a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline163.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> raise at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline164.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> makes the waves a little bit out-lying than the other values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>a and makes the peaks sharper.

To approximate the probability of an outbreak, 5000 sample paths are simulated for 1 initial infected individuals, and the simulation will stop if either <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline216.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline217.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is reached. If the total asymptomatically infected and infected population reaches 100, it is counted as an outbreak. When it reaches zero, it is assumed that there is a probability of extinction. The calculated probability of extinction is a proportion of 5000 sample paths as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline218.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.

Parameter values are shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline220.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is computed from the expression of Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp13">3.8</xref>).</p>

The outbreak value increases when the transmission rate from the susceptible to asymptomatically infected class and from the susceptible to infected class increases. It is obvious that, when the transmission from susceptible to infected populations increase, the risk of outbreak will increase. But for the transmission from the susceptible class to the asymptomatically infected class, there is a threshold value for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline223.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, not for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline224.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Here, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline225.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> serves as a threshold parameter value for the disease outbreak of the ordinary differential equation system Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp3">2.3</xref>) when all other parameter are fixed. Also, the probability of an outbreak depends on the initial number of infected populations.<sup><xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> For our model parameter values, the basic reproduction number is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline226.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and the probability of an outbreak is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline227.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p>

              <p>Now we are in a world where interdisciplinary research is the most critical mechanism to live a healthy and standard life for all of humankind. Over the decades, mathematical prediction modeling used to be one of the essential tools to study and understand any epidemics’ behavior. It helps the policy-maker to make a crucial decision and get prepared for the coming days. This study’s aim was to develop a mathematical model with real-time data<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and predict the dynamics of the COVID-19 in the state of Texas.</p>
              <p>We used the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline281.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (modified SEIR) modeling framework to design our model. We estimated the model parameters using the data from Texas<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> from March 6, 2020, to January 31, 2021. The average basic reproduction number, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline282.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, calculated as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline283.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for the system Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp3">2.3</xref>). A study by Liu et al. 2020<sup>35</sup> calculates the median of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline284.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline285.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> with a range from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline286.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline287.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p>
              <p>Our model predicted that the net peak of daily new cases occurred at the first week of January, 2021, with new infections on the peak day (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>b). The epidemic will have another wave after April of 2021 infecting people in total during this period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>b).</p>
              <p>According to the CDC, the incubation period of the COVID-19 is 2-14 d.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Lauer et al.<sup><xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> estimated the COVID-19 mean incubation period as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline288.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> days. We considered the baseline incubation period of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline289.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> d in our model. The incubation period may be different for the nature of the population or the individual patient. A <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline290.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> larger incubation period forces the peak epidemic size bigger and earlier with an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline291.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline292.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline293.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> smaller incubation period delayed peak epidemic in a smaller size with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline294.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline295.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
              <p>Scientists worldwide are trying to find the proper control measures to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus; social distancing, quarantine of the exposed individuals, isolation of infected persons, and wearing face masks are widely used strategies. The main target for containing the virus is to reduce the contact between susceptible and exposed/infected persons, which eventually will reduce the transmission rate from the susceptible class (<italic>S</italic>) to the infected classes (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline296.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>). Texas closed schools, colleges, nonessential businesses during March 2020 and finally put the stay-at-home order at the beginning of April until the end of April 2020. This restriction delayed the earlier predicted peak on June 15 by Cooper et al.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> We concluded that it is more important to control the asymptomatically exposed individual’s contact with the population than the symptomatic infected person, as the symptomatic infected person already develops some symptoms. Hence, they know that they are contagious and restricted them from mixing with others. The asymptomatically exposed individual who does not have any symptoms may spread the virus even without knowing that they are contagious.</p>
              <p>Our model suggests that the sensitivity of the transmission rate due to contact between susceptible and asymptomatically infected persons is 5 times greater than the transmission rate caused by the contact between susceptible to infected individuals. A <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline297.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> increase of the transmission rate from the susceptible population to the asymptomatically exposed population increases the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline298.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline299.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline300.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline301.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> decrease the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline302.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline303.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref> for epidemic size and the total number of infection). To get a similar change on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline304.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, we had to increase/decrease the transmission rate from susceptible person to infected person, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline305.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline306.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> for change in epidemic size and total infection). Due to the unavailability of the data, this article did not track the dynamics of the asymptomatic carrier. Tracking asymptomatic infection could provide additional insight into the dynamics of the disease.</p>
              <p>A total of 250 of 254 counties reported SARS-CoV-2 infections, with nearly 2 million cases in all of Texas by January 31, 2021. Fifty-eight counties reported more than 1000 cases, 22 counties reported more than 5000 cases, and 11 counties reported more than 10,000 cases. In contrast, 89 counties reported less than 100 confirmed cases of coronavirus. It is noticeable that the top 6 infected counties (Harris, Dallas, Bexar, Tarrant, Travis) reported more than 50% of the total number of infections in Texas.<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>County-wise daily case analysis for the top 15 (70% of Texas) infected counties (see Supplementary Tables <uri xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.151">A1</uri>, <uri xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.151">A2</uri>, <uri xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.151">A3</uri>, <uri xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.151">A4</uri>) shows that some counties (Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar, El Paso Travis) may pass their second epidemic peak. However, other counties (such as Montgomery, Williamson) still have an uptrend in daily new infections. Proper implementation of the health expert’s suggestions, such as using face coverings, maintaining social distance, and frequent hand washing, could play an important role in epidemic dynamics.</p>
              <p>Additionally, the under-reporting of numerous daily deaths due cuased by coronavirus in different counties within the state again goes in line with the results of our <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline307.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> model. According to this simple yet effective exploratory prediction model, the early relaxation of lockdown (in April) within the state (overall in the United States) has potentially contributed to the exponential rise in COVID-19 cases. If the uptrend continues, the government and policy-makers have to rigorously prepare at a highly rapid pace for a large nationwide surge in patients presenting to intensive care units, also anticipating the daily rate at which front-line workers (both medical and law enforcement professionals) may succumb to death while serving the nation. The Texas governor may need to introduce draconian measures such as stay-at-home order and massive fines to limit population mobility and gatherings immediately.</p>
              <p>The mathematical model has some limitations; our model has some as well. Texas has a different kind of epidemic scenario for different cities and counties; for instance, at a particular time, some cities and counties have stay-at-home order, other does not have the same restriction. The diversity of the population changes the contact behavior between population and changes the dynamics. Texas has has a mandatory mask policy since July 2, 2020.<sup><xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> We did not consider those variations in our modeling approach. The next iteration of the modeling approach could implement the discussed idea to reveal additional insights into disease dynamics. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, and scientists all over the world discovered new information every day, which could lead to a new understanding of the disease dynamics.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In conclusion, our <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline308.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> prediction model has successfully exhibited findings in line with the current practical situation regarding the ongoing and forthcoming COVID-19 epidemic transmission in Texas, USA. The state is already in an extremely critical situation, and the peak time near the door or passing. Learning from the experiences of other high-index countries with robust health systems, the government and policy-makers of Texas need to be extra vigilant and look for alternate, effective and aggressive measures for limiting the catastrophic impacts of the contagion and protecting the front-line workers. They risk their lives to provide essential services.</p>

</p>
                  <p>This implies <disp-formula id="dispA1"><label>(A.1)</label><graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_eqn15.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>
</p>
                  <p>Hence, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline309.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> whenever<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_eqnu14.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>
</p>
                  <p>Hence, this inequality claims that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline310.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is bounded by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline311.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p>
                  <p>Now, integrating the inequality in (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="dispA1">A.1</xref>) and using the initial condition, we get</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline312.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, we obtain <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline313.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> asymptotically.</p>
                  <p>Thus it has been established that, all components of the solution of Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp3">2.3</xref>) are positive and bounded in the closed region.</p>

</p>
                  <p>Then the characteristic equation gives the eigenvalues as<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_eqnu16.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>and the other two eigenvalues are the roots of the following quadratic equation<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_eqnu17.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>where,<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_eqnu18.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>

</p>
                  <p>Here, two possible scenarios can happen:</p>
                  <p>1. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline314.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, then <italic>B</italic> obviously positive. Again <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline315.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> indicates that<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_eqnu21.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>
</p>
                  <p>Thus, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline316.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Then Routh-Hurwitz criterion for polynomials implies that DFE is stable.</p>
                  <p>2. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline317.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, then <italic>B</italic> obviously negative. Thus, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline318.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Again, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline319.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline320.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Since <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline321.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is a continuous function of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline322.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, hence by Bolzano’s theorem on continuous function we have <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline323.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for some <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline324.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, at least one eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix is positive. Hence, DFE point is unstable equilibrium point.</p>
                  <p>This completes the proof.</p>

</p>
                  <p>Here, the first eigenvalue is negative, then the system will be locally asymptotically stable if other 3 eigenvalues are all negative or their real parts are negative. The other 3 eigenvalues will be negative or will have negative real parts if the Routh-Hurwitz criterion is satisfied.</p>
                  <p>From Routh-Hurwitz criterion, we can say that the EE point is stable if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline327.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline328.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Therefore the EE of Equation (3), which exists if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="S1935789321001518_inline329.jpg" mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is locally asymptotically stable.</p>
