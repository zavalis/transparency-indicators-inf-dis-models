  give appropriate return values.


aRxiv 0.5.10
------------

BUG FIXES

* Fix a small problem related to a new behavior in a pre-release
  version of the httr package. (httr is no longer dropping NULLs from
  the POST search body.)

  returned by a query.


aRxiv 0.5.8
------------

BUG FIXES

* arXiv connection errors was causing test errors. Added a function to
  test connection to arXiv; tests are skipped if we can't connect.

* try to avoid many of the tests on CRAN, where intermittent test
  errors will cause universal headaches.

------------

BUG FIXES

* Fix mistakes in the table in the help for arxiv_search that
  describes the output.

* When searching in batches, arxiv_search could return more than the
  requested limit.

* Fix tests of date range; a new 2013 arXiv manuscript changed the
  expected count.
