Data availability: Results specific to the model run for this publication are accessible for each state (http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/united-states-covid-19-scenarios-2020-2021). The estimates viewable in our online tool (https://covid19.healthdata.org/) will be iteratively updated as new data are incorporated and will ultimately supersede the results in this paper. The findings of this study are supported by data available in public online repositories and data that are available upon request from the data provider; non-publicly available data were used under license for the current study but can be made available with permission of the data provider; contact information is provided where applicable.

The testing covariate was constructed using data from the COVID Tracking Project (https://covidtracking.com/data/api/). State-level datasets for the testing covariate were replaced in Washington, using https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard. Mask-use data were obtained from Premise COVID-19 Global Impact Survey (https://www.premise.com/the-dos-and-donts-of-conducting-surveys-during-covid-19/; with access coordinated through info@premise.com); the Facebook (COVID) Symptom Survey (with access coordinated through University of Maryland Joint Program in Survey Methodology via admin-C19survey-fb@umd.edu); and the YouGov COVID-19 Behavioural Tracker Survey (https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker). Pneumonia seasonality estimates, particulate matter air pollution estimates, lower respiratory infection country-specific mortality rate estimates and smoking estimates were generated by the Global Burden of Disease study (http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/united-states-covid-19-scenarios-2020-2021/). Altitude was sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Environmental Information Global Land One-km Base Elevation Project (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/topo/globe.html) and population data were obtained from WorldPop Population Counts (https://www.worldpop.org/project/list/).
