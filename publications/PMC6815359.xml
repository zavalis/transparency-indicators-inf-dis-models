              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par18">The nature of infectious diseases has been changing rapidly in conjunction with dramatic societal and environmental changes. This is a substantial challenge in terms of emergency preparedness requiring the implementation of a wide range of surveillance policies. The recent emergence of Zika outbreaks associated with birth defects prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency of international concern in February 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. After that, there has been an explosion in research and planning as the global health community has turned their attention to understanding and controlling Zika virus. However, the lack of important information needed to assess the global health threat from the virus still remains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The behavior of an infectious disease is often formidable or sometimes not feasible to be evaluated by conducting experiments with real communities. As a result, mathematical models explaining the transmission of infectious diseases are a valuable tool for planning disease-management policies.</p>
              <p id="Par19">An important question when a new emerging disease occurs is the disease transmission mechanism and how infectious the disease is. A key concept in epidemiology to indicate the scale and speed of spread in a susceptible population is the transmissibility of the infection, characterized by the basic reproduction number, <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>. This quantity has a definition of longer-term endemicity in a given population (<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> &lt; 1 stops an epidemic) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. An extensive range of estimation methods have been proposed (see examples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]). Although the basic reproduction number can be useful for understanding the transmissibility of an infectious disease, the methods based on fitting deterministic transmission models are often difficult to use and generalize in practice due to context-specific assumptions which often do not hold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">It is of practical importance to consider a computationally feasible and robust methodology to evaluate the force of infection. It has been proposed that the time course of an epidemic can be partly achieved by estimating the effective (instantaneous) reproduction number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, since the contact rates among people may differ due to differences the local environment, human behavior, vector abundance, and, potentially, interactions with other viruses, disease transmissibility will vary across locations as well. Although spatial heterogeneity has been considered (see examples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]), the reproduction numbers are estimated separately for single areas without accounting for spatial variation and overdispersion in modeling. Due to very limited information when new emerging infection initially occurs, it is natural to look for strategies that mirror relevant information. Surveillance systems have been operated singly for various types of infectious diseases, however with multiple streams of geo-coded disease information available it is important to be able to take advantage of the multivariate health data. The benefits of multivariate surveillance lie in the ability to observe concurrency of patterns of disease and to allow conditioning of one disease on others. To assist public health practitioners to assess disease transmissibility in field settings, we thus develop the proposed methodology to allow for incorporating spatiotemporal knowledge from related diseases to enhance performance of surveillance system which was not considered in previous studies.</p>
              <p id="Par21">The aim of this study is to develop a generic and robust methodology for estimating spatiotemporally varying transmissibility that can be instantaneously computed for each location and time within a user-friendly environment for real-time surveillance. Not only our method has a practical interpretation with theoretical foundation but also can be understood and applied by non-technical users. The proposed method is defined in the next section with a simulation study to demonstrate robustness of the methodology. A case study is also provided of an application of integrative surveillance of Dengue and Zika virus activities in Thailand.</p>

                <title>Spatiotemporal measure of disease transmission</title>
                <p id="Par22">The basic reproduction number is one of the principal concepts widely used as an epidemiological measure of the transmission potential which is theoretically defined as the number of secondary infections produced by a single infectious individuals in a susceptible population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, not withstanding the issues with underlying theoretical assumptions such as population susceptibility and dynamic nature of infectious diseases, the basic reproduction number is difficult to apply in real situations. For instance, few epidemics are only ever observed when a new infection enters in a susceptible population in which the disease can also persist but had not been or able to be detected for a period of time. This situation violates a primary assumption about the ‘at risk’ population which commonly appears in new emerging diseases such as Zika. Another example is that the nature of infectious diseases is dynamic and should be consistently monitored whereas the basic reproduction number is an infinite measure which then fails to satisfy the dynamic behavior of infections. Therefore, we need to be cautious about the underlying model assumptions when applying the concept. Otherwise, it could lead to inappropriate disease-management policies or even uncontrollable outbreaks (see more discussion in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). In this paper we propose an alternative measure of spatiotemporally varying disease transmission, which we will call the surveillance reproduction number. Not affected by context-specific restrictions, this measure provides a practical interpretation that can be flexibly applied to many applications in infectious disease epidemiology. Moreover this measure which accounts for spatiotemporal heterogeneity can robustly estimate the disease strength simultaneously for all areal units and time periods, and is ideally suitable for emerging disease surveillance. To derive the proposed methodology, compartment modeling is reviewed as the foundation of our development.</p>
                <p id="Par23">There are various forms of compartmental models for infectious diseases (see examples in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). One of the early modeling contributions is the Kermack-McKendrick model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], a compartmental model with formulation of flow rates between disease stages of a population. A special case of the model is the well-known <italic>SIR</italic> (susceptible-infectious-recovered) model. A <italic>SIR</italic> model is usually used to describe a situation where a disease confers immunity against re-infection, to indicate that the passage of individuals is from the susceptible class <italic>S</italic> to the infective class <italic>I</italic> and to the removed class <italic>R</italic>. A common <italic>SIR</italic> model used to describe the disease at location <italic>i</italic> and time <italic>t</italic> can be specified as follows:

                <p id="Par29">Hence, to estimate the surveillance number with prevalence, the ratio of incidence and prevalence is assumed to be nearly constant over time. This is a limitation of our development. This assumption may not be appropriate for long duration diseases such as chronic conditions but rather suitable for infections with relatively short duration.</p>
                <p id="Par30">The proposed methodology has practical advantages over the traditional basic reproduction number. One of which is that our method is based on prevalence, not affected by the assumption about susceptibility which is often difficult or infeasible to know. Another, since our metric is dynamic (does not depend on the infinite definition), it can be sequentially calculated which is very suitable for monitoring the disease strength, ideally for emerging diseases.</p>
                <p id="Par31">To account for spatiotemporal variation and overdispersion, <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> is modeled to link to a linear predictor consisting of local variables such as environmental and demographic factors and space-time random effects to account for spatiotemporal heterogeneity as log(<italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub>) = <italic>α</italic> + <bold><italic>X</italic></bold><sub><italic>it</italic></sub><bold><italic>β</italic></bold><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> + <italic>u</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> + <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> + <italic>λ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> + <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub>. The correlated (<italic>u</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) and uncorrelated (<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) spatial components have an intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) prior distribution and zero mean Gaussian distribution respectively. In addition, there are a separate temporal random effect (<italic>λ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) and a space-time interaction term (<italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub>) in the linear predictor. Often the temporal effect is described using an autoregressive prior distribution such allowing for a type of nonparametric temporal effect. Note that this distribution is a random walk prior distribution with one-unit lag. For the interaction term, the prior structure is usually assumed to be distributed as a zero mean Gaussian distribution. The estimate of the reproduction number is however also dependent on the choice of the infectiousness profile, <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub>(<italic>l</italic>), which assumes to be Log-Normal distributed and standardized to sum to one.</p>

                <title>Simulation study</title>
                <p id="Par33">To evaluate our proposed methodology, we simulate data without covariates in several situations with different magnitudes of transmissibility. The simulation map used as a basis for our evaluation is the district map of the province of Bangkok, Thailand. This province has 50 districts (<italic>i</italic> = 1–50) with a reasonably regular spatial distribution. The simulated incidence are generated for 20 weeks (<italic>t</italic> = 1–20) in four district groups with different levels of the reproduction numbers. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> displays the maps showing locations of simulated <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> of each district group at weeks 5, 10, 15, and 20. The simulated incidence of each district group with different levels of <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> in which each dot represents a simulated value from a given simulation set. The first group (middle region in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) is simulated with increasing magnitudes of transmission as <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>s</italic>, <italic>it</italic></sub> = 0.2 + (<italic>t</italic> × 0.15). The <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>s</italic>, <italic>it</italic></sub> is assumed to be increasing every time period by the size of 0.15. Then incidence with an exponentially increase is generated in this scenario to represent regions with an outbreak (left panel in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The second district group (western region in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) is assumed to have decreasing magnitudes simulated as <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>s</italic>, <italic>it</italic></sub> = 4.0 − (<italic>t</italic> × 0.2). As can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (second panel from the left), the incidence in this scenario increases at the beginning due to strongly positive force of infection but will be decreasing afterwards. In the third scenario (eastern region in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>s</italic>, <italic>it</italic></sub> is assumed to have the size of 1.5 until week 12 and then reduced to 0.8 afterwards. This scenario represents the situation where an effective intervention is introduced to control an outbreak. The rest of the districts are assumed to have a constant low infection rate at <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>s</italic>, <italic>it</italic></sub> = 0.8 over the 20 time periods. To sample the discrete weight <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>il</italic></sub> is drawn from a normal distribution with mean of 1.5 with standard deviation of one. The infectious time, <italic>L</italic>, of 3 weeks is set to generate the incidence.

However we are interested in the loss function in estimation of <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> .

Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> (bottom row) presents the MSPRE for district groups corresponding to different choices of infection time window. We can see the infectious time of 3 weeks has both the least MSE and MSPRE. Thus this metric can provide guidance on which the time windows to consider in practice. The use of MSPRE will also be demonstrated in a case study provided later. It should be noted that the time elapsed since infection, <italic>l</italic>, could vary by individual. However we model the aggregated count conditional on spatial units instead of at individual level. Then the infectious time would be averaged over an area. Given the sampling framework it is reasonable to assume a constant infectious time for the population. Nonetheless it is also possible that the infectious time has a spatiotemporal distribution over the study area which is perhaps dependent on environmental or demographic variables. Then the covariates should be included in the model when available as well.</p>
                <p id="Par38">As presented we have developed a robust methodology to estimate disease transmissibility varying across locations and time periods. Our method allows for computational flexibility not affected by conventional restrictions which generally are difficult to apply in real situations. However due to very limited knowledge when new emerging infection initially occurs, it is extremely challenging for policy makers to make decision based upon enormous uncertainty. Therefore it is essential to consider the analysis integrating relevant information streams in order to develop the best disease-management plans possible. Hence in the next section we extend the univariate framework to allow for incorporating knowledge from related diseases.</p>

Thus utilizing knowledge, we have from other sources such as related diseases can principally help improving the surveillance system.

In general, once multiple diseases are introduced into an analysis there is a need to consider relations between the diseases. This can be achieved in various ways.

                <title>Application to dengue and Zika virus surveillance activities in Thailand</title>
                <p id="Par41">Dengue is endemic in Thailand with peak transmission rates occur in the rainy season, between June and September, all across the country, but particularly in northeastern Thailand. Zika was first reported in Thailand in 2012, and the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority has been conducting regular screen tests on its residents since then. To demonstrate performance of the proposed integrative method we apply the multivariate surveillance number, <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>ms</italic></sub>, to the Dengue and Zika prevalence in Thailand. The cases of both diseases were from the province of Chanthaburi consisting of 10 health districts during July 10th until August 27th 2016, total of 7 weeks. The information of case patients was reported by the public hospitals to surveillance center. Note that the dengue patients included in this analysis were both who diagnosed with Dengue fever (DF) and Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The results displayed are based on the approximation of the surveillance number developed using prevalence in (6) and posterior sampling carried out using WinBUGS software an initial burn-in period of 100,000 iterations to assess the convergence of MCMC chains.</p>
                <p id="Par42">The estimates of the surveillance numbers are expected to depend on the choice of the size of infectious time <italic>l</italic>. The <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito is the primary vector of Dengue. The virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes. After virus incubation for 4–10 days, an infected mosquito is capable of transmitting the virus for the rest of its life. Infected symptomatic or asymptomatic humans are the main carriers and multipliers of the virus, serving as a source of the virus for uninfected mosquitoes. Patients who are already infected with the dengue virus can transmit the infection (for 4–5 days; maximum 12 days) via <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes after their first symptoms appear. Zika is usually milder with symptoms lasting for several days to a week. People usually don’t get sick enough to go to the hospital, and they very rarely die of Zika [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par43">MSPRE is applied to guide on the choice of infectious time for the model. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> displays the values of MSPRE of both diseases fitted with different sizes of the infectious times. The window size of 2 weeks fitted with the univariate model yields the least MSPRE for Zika and Dengue. Though based on the clinical manifestation point of view a window size less than 2 weeks may be possible for Zika, the result suggested by MSPRE is sensible combining with knowledge from epidemiological perspective that incubation period and virus lifespan in a mosquito can prolong the infectious period. Nonetheless we have only weekly data and would recommend using a finer temporal scale if appropriate when such data are available. To evaluate the performance, we compare the univariate and multivariate models weekly so that both models would have the same set of data. Based on the guidance from MSPRE and information discussed earlier, we thus choose the size of infectious time to be 2 weeks for both diseases in the analysis. Because the infectious times are assumed to be 2 weeks, for simplicity, we assume the weights of serial intervals to have a Beta (1,1) prior distribution instead of standardized log-normal distribution. All covariance matrices are assumed to be a fixed matrix of <inline-formula id="IEq25"><alternatives><tex-math id="M65">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The DIC of the multivariate model is less than the ones from each disease fitted separately by the univariate model across all time periods. Moreover, pD, which can be seen as model complexity, is also much smaller in the case of multivariate model. This suggests that pooling information from both diseases in the analysis essentially decreases variability in model fitting and provides a much better description of the spreading pattern of Zika and Dengue.

However <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>ms</italic></sub> (bottom row, the second column in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) of Dengue, which also infuses information of Zika pattern in the integrative platform, provides a smaller transmission rate than <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> (middle row, the second column in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) at a district in the south during the week of August 7th – August 13th.

              <p id="Par46">A new emerging disease can occur in one place and have the potential to spread globally. This is an important challenge in terms of emergency preparation requiring the operation of surveillance systems. A traditional concept to study the dynamic of infectious diseases is the basic reproduction number. However, the intuitive appeal of its theoretical interpretation can outlast the appropriateness of situations if applied incautiously. So it is remarkably crucial to be aware of their caveats when adopting that measure. Otherwise, it could mislead to the inappropriate backbone of disease-management policy. Alternatively, we present a robust and flexible methodology for estimating spatiotemporally varying reproduction numbers. Withstanding the issues of context-specific assumptions, our method provides more practical advantages and can be used to simultaneously estimate disease transmissibility for each location and time within a user-friendly environment for real-time assessment of new emerging diseases.</p>
              <p id="Par47">To evaluate our method, we simulate data in several situations with different magnitudes of transmission and sizes of infectious period. The simulation results suggest that the proposed method allows robust estimation of the surveillance reproduction number used for simulation across simulated scenarios. Though from the simulation study the method would not suffer much from the infection window size, MSPRE may be helpful in providing guidance on the choice of infectious period in practice. Due to limited information when new emerging infection newly occurs, the univariate framework is extended to allow for incorporating knowledge from related diseases in order to maximize the surveillance capability. A case study is provided of an integrative application of Dengue and Zika surveillance in Thailand.</p>
              <p id="Par48">A significant portion of arbovirus incidence (eg. ZIKA) is underestimated due to asymptomatic infection without presenting any clinical symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Nevertheless, the contribution of asymptomatic reservoirs to the overall disease burden has not been well quantified, which introduces considerable uncertainty into modeling studies of disease transmission dynamics and control strategies. Policy and practice on case detection and reporting of Dengue and Zika is a critical factor due to the nature of diseases that have high proportion of asymptomatic infection. Therefore novel surveillance tools, such as integrated surveillance, should be developed and applied to improve estimates of disease incidence especially asymptomatic infections such as Dengue and Zika.</p>
              <p id="Par49">The significance of our development lies in the advantages of multivariate surveillance in the ability to borrow strength across diseases and to allow conditioning of one on others. When applying the multivariate framework, the relevant diseases should epidemiologically and clinically sound. Studies indicate the underlying possibility for Zika to have a similar spreading pattern to Dengue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We hence extend our method to allow for integrating related diseases’ information and also demonstrate its performance in the example of Dengue and Zika surveillance in Thailand. The data example shows that combining both diseases in an integrated analysis essentially decreases variability of model fitting. The result suggests that the proposed integrative platform which allows for transferring transmission knowledge between the related diseases sharing similar etiology not only can enhance the estimation of transmissibility but also helps explaining the spreading pattern of Zika and Dengue much better. This is a significant importance of the proposed multi-disease measure in improving surveillance ability.</p>
              <p id="Par50">Though the proposed method demonstrates robust performance, it should be noted that those data present a lot of both clinical and epidemiological complexity. In this work we prevalence information is assumed for the model due to difficulties of disease investigation which implies that the ratio of incidence and prevalence is nearly constant over time. This is a limitation of our development. This assumption may not be appropriate for chronic diseases but rather suitable for infections with relatively short duration. There is a further need for studies of virus circulation persistence and the ecological factors including characterizing immunological cross-reacting which could shorten or prolong the epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Across both clinical and ecological studies, it is also important to evaluate the effect of host, viral, and vector relationships for fuller understanding of the disease mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, the proposed methodology can be served as a flexible platform to incorporate those potential epidemiologic and ecologic determinants that drive the disease risk as they are available.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par51">New emerging diseases are public health crises in which policy makers have had to make decisions in the presence of massive uncertainty. As presented the proposed methodology is robust in several simulated scenarios of transmission force with computing flexibility and practical benefits. Thus this development is ideally suitable for surveillance applications of new emerging diseases such as Zika. To further prevent and control new emerging infection, we must have a fuller understand the modes of transmission which are currently lacking. In such context, it is natural to look for strategies that mirror those applied for relevant diseases. By transferring information from diseases sharing the similar etiology such as Dengue, our multivariate framework can successfully integrate knowledge and hence improve the surveillance system effectively. Therefore, in current situations whereas there are threats from new infection, a robust and flexible platform is thus essentially needed to be readily prepared in order to rapidly gain an understanding of the new disease transmission mechanism to counter the local and global health concerns.</p>
