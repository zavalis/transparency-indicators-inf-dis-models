                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Little evidence exists on the differential health effects of COVID-19 on disadvantaged population groups. Here we characterise the differential risk of hospitalisation and death in SÃ£o Paulo state, Brazil, and show how vulnerability to COVID-19 is shaped by socioeconomic inequalities.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We conducted a cross-sectional study using hospitalised severe acute respiratory infections notified from March to August 2020 in the <italic>Sistema de Monitoramento Inteligente de SÃ£o Paulo</italic> database. We examined the risk of hospitalisation and death by race and socioeconomic status using multiple data sets for individual-level and spatiotemporal analyses. We explained these inequalities according to differences in daily mobility from mobile phone data, teleworking behaviour and comorbidities.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Throughout the study period, patients living in the 40% poorest areas were more likely to die when compared with patients living in the 5% wealthiest areas (OR: 1.60, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.74) and were more likely to be hospitalised between April and July 2020 (OR: 1.08, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.12). Black and <italic>Pardo</italic> individuals were more likely to be hospitalised when compared with White individuals (OR: 1.41, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.46; OR: 1.26, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.28, respectively), and were more likely to die (OR: 1.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.19; 1.07, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.10, respectively) between April and July 2020. Once hospitalised, patients treated in public hospitals were more likely to die than patients in private hospitals (OR: 1.40%, 95% CI 1.34% to 1.46%). Black individuals and those with low education attainment were more likely to have one or more comorbidities, respectively (OR: 1.29, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.39; 1.36, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.45).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Low-income and Black and <italic>Pardo</italic> communities are more likely to die with COVID-19. This is associated with differential access to quality healthcare, ability to self-isolate and the higher prevalence of comorbidities.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the effects of social inequalities on exposure and death in low socioeconomic groups,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> particularly in Brazil, where it has caused significant mortality.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The prevalence of COVID-19 mortality is partially driven by pre-existing non-communicable diseases, which are socially clustered due to entrenched inequalities.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> These inequalities are shaped by the social determinants of health,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> which define a populationâs health based on the environments where they âgrow, live, work, and ageâ, from birth.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Even when underlying health conditions are not present, the interactions of these social determinants disproportionately expose disadvantaged groups to COVID-19<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and other conditions that could induce adverse chronic health conditions.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Furthermore, a review has found that disadvantaged groups are the most vulnerable to the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> which can aggravate the severity of COVID-19.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>Several studies that have been conducted in the context of high-income countries have mostly focused on the USA,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8â10</xref> UK<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> and European countries,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> which have consistently found that populations identified as non-White, of low socioeconomic status and those living in high poverty were associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 death. Few studies have addressed the uneven impact of COVID-19 by socioeconomic status and race in low and middle-income countries,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> in part because national surveillance systems seldom collect or report this information.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In Brazil, higher risk of COVID-19 death has been found for Black and <italic>Pardo</italic> (mixed ethnicity) Brazilians, especially those who are identified as male with low socioeconomic status.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> Nonetheless, there is still little information on how the differential health outcomes of COVID-19 are shaped by broader social inequalities that determine the capacity to self-isolate and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).</p>
              <p>It is paramount to understand the potential social drivers of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, particularly in countries with high inequality such as Brazil.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The first COVID-19 cases in Brazil were detected in SÃ£o Paulo,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> the most populous state and home to diverse racial groups. In the Brazilian context of politically polarised public health responses,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> SÃ£o Paulo has been severely affected by COVID-19<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and access to testing has been limited for low-income populations.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>
              <p>We conducted a multiscale analysis to investigate the risk of hospitalisation and death from severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), predominantly caused by COVID-19,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> notified from March to August 2020, in the <italic>Sistema de Monitoramento Inteligente de SÃ£o Paulo</italic> (SIMI-SP) database, for SÃ£o Paulo state. We considered all SARI cases instead of only including patients who tested positive for COVID-19 to avoid the bias in access to SARS-CoV-2 testing towards higher socioeconomic classes in Brazil,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> which allows us to better capture the disproportionate impact of social inequities on racial and socioeconomic groups. We examined differential risk by race and socioeconomic status, by combining multiple high-resolution data from mobile phones, government census and population surveys conducted during the epidemic. We assessed potential drivers of these inequalities by evaluating local levels of self-isolation, access to teleworking and prevalence of comorbidities.</p>

                  <title>SARI and patient information</title>
                  <p>Patient-level information on demographic characteristics, home address, hospitalisation and health outcomes was collected from the SÃ£o Paulo State Health Secretariat SARI hospitalisations database (SIMI-SP).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> SARI can be caused by SARS-CoV-2 and is defined by the Brazilian Ministry of Health as influenza-like syndrome plus one of the following: dyspnoea, persistent chest pain or hypoxia. We excluded all SARI cases that were confirmed to be caused by other respiratory viruses. All SARI cases and deaths are notified in the SIMI-SP database, regardless of hospitalisation.</p>
                  <p>We included all SARI related hospitalisations and deaths notified in SÃ£o Paulo state between March 15 and August 29, 2020. Given that recent data is incomplete due to reporting delays<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and to avoid biases, we limited our analysis to patients with symptoms onset between these dates (epidemiological weeks 10 â 35). We also included SARI cases with unknown etiology, as those are likely related to COVID-19 but not lab-confirmed due to low rates of COVID-19 testing in Brazil<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and socioeconomic bias in testing.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>
                  <p>Zip code information was only available for cases reported in SÃ£o Paulo state. Data were geocoded using the patientâs self-reported home address or postal code with Galileo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.img.com.br">www.img.com.br</ext-link>) and Google API. For our analysis, we aggregated these data to the census tract level (n=68 296), the smallest administrative unit reported by the Brazilian census for the purpose of spatial statistical analysis. In the state of SÃ£o Paulo, 95% of the census tracts have a population size between 136 and 1347 individuals (median=724). Information on the health facility where each case was notified was linked to the National Registry of Health Facilities (Cadastro Nacional de Estabelecimentos de SaÃºde), which includes information on the mode of healthcare provision (public and private).</p>
                  <p>The race of patients was partially self-declared and partially identified by a health professional. Race was categorised as either âWhiteâ, âBlackâ, âAsianâ (East or Southeast Asian), â<italic>Pardo</italic>â (mixed ethnic ancestries with diverse skin colours)<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> or Indigenous. Race information was missing for 53â480 (23.9%) of retrieved SARI cases, and was imputed using the racial distribution of the census tract of residence (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental materials</xref> for details). About 0.1% of the population in SÃ£o Paulo self-identified as Indigenous<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and since only 166 Indigenous patients (0.07%) were recorded, they were not considered in our analysis.</p>

                  <p>We obtained data on municipality-level socioeconomic factors from the latest population census (2010) compiled by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e EstatÃ­stica; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/sociais/populacao/9662-censo-demografico-2010.html?=&amp;t=o-que-e">IBGE</ext-link>). We selected indicators based on their relevance to the social determinants of health as defined by the WHOâs Commission on Social Determinants of Health,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> which includes income and income distribution, education, employment and job security, and access to healthcare. We included household income per capita, population density and income inequality (Gini Index). We also determined the proportion of residents with a primary education or lower, employment to population ratio and the proportion of the working population without a formal labour market contract or social security. The road network distance from the centroid of each census tract to the nearest healthcare facility was computed considering all 830 facilities that hospitalised patients with SARI via the public healthcare system (Sistema Ãnico de SaÃºde; SUS). Information on employment status and comorbidities during the epidemic was retrieved from the National Household Sample Survey (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de DomicÃ­lios (PNAD) COVID-19), a national telephone survey conducted by IBGE with over 1 888 560 interviews between May and September 2020.

                  <p>To assess the broader risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond hospitalisation, we adopted seroprevalence data collected as part of the national Covid-IgG study from blood donors aged 16 â 69 living in SÃ£o Paulo city.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Given that samples were taken across the city, a population-weighted cluster sample of approximately 1000 blood donations were tested each month between February and August 2020 using a chemiluminescence assay that detects IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein (Abbott, Chicago, USA). Self-reported race and education level were recorded at the time of blood donation. To correct for differences in the age-sex distribution of blood donors compared with the population of SÃ£o Paulo, we applied an age-sex normalisation to the measured prevalence.

The daily isolation index from hexagons was regressed on a set of relative time dummies that indicated the number of days before and after the first NPI introduction in SÃ£o Paulo state. Hexagon fixed effects controlled for unobserved time-invariant determinants of self-isolation while day fixed effects controlled for temporal shocks common to all hexagons. We further included an additional time-varying control variable, representing the number of days relative to the first confirmed SARI case in each hexagon, and a dummy variable indicating the period of NPI relaxation in each municipality.

                <p>During the first month of the COVID-19 epidemic (March) in Brazil, hospitalised patients were more likely to be White or Asian and come from census tracts with higher income per capita (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2A, B</xref>). During this period, people living in low-income areas were less likely (OR: 0.44, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.46) to be hospitalised with SARI compared with high-income areas. We found that point estimates of inequality levels do not change substantially when observations with missing race information are dropped, though CIs become smaller (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure S1</xref>). This coincides with the early introduction of COVID-19 in Brazil, when the first infections occurred among higher income travellers returning from overseas.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 23</xref></p>

                <p>As the epidemic progressed from April onwards, patients were on average more likely to be from low-income census tracts (April to July, OR: 1.08, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.12), except for August, when patients were less likely to be from low-income census tracts (OR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00). Similarly during this time period, Black Brazilians and <italic>Pardos</italic> became more likely to be hospitalised with SARI than Whites (OR: 1.41, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.46; OR: 1.26, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.28, respectively), while Asians became the least likely to be hospitalised (OR: 0.88, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.94). These results were further confirmed by our seroprevalence findings, where both crude and adjusted prevalence (for age, sex, sensitivity and specificity of the sex) showed that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were highest in Black blood donors and those with low educational attainment across all age groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure S2</xref>).</p>
                <p>Once hospitalised, Black and <italic>Pardo</italic> patients were more likely to die from SARI than White patients between March and August (OR: 1.14, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.21; 1.09, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.13, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2C</xref>). This difference was more pronounced in March and decreased over time. Because our analysis does not control for comorbidities, these results indirectly reflect the differences in the incidence of comorbidities across racial groups. We found that patients living in the poorest census tracts were more likely to die from SARI compared with patients from the wealthiest tracts (OR: 1.60, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.74) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2D</xref>).

Racial differences in the probability of death decreased when considering only patients hospitalised at public health facilities but persisted among patients in private facilities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure S3</xref>).</p>

                <p>To understand the geographical variation in SARI hospitalisation, we estimated and mapped the relative risk of SARI hospitalisation at the municipality level (n=645 municipalities) for SÃ£o Paulo state by month using a model with a spatial structure defined by human movement fluxes derived from anonymised mobile phone data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>) and covariates related to socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3B</xref>). Overall, municipalities with higher levels of movement exchange with the RMSP had higher monthly risk of SARI hospitalisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3C</xref>). We found a lower risk of SARI by SARS-CoV-2 hospitalisation in municipalities with high income per capita (fixed effect=â0.87, 95% CI â1.12 to â0.62) and high proportion of adult residents with a primary education or lower (â0.90, 95% CI â1.12 to â0.68). Municipalities with fewer nearby public health facilities were also found to have lower risk of hospitalisation (â0.31, 95% CI â0.55 to â0.08).

                <p>We found that over time, the risk of SARI hospitalisation increased particularly in municipalities near and within the RMSP (greater metropolitan area of SÃ£o Paulo), where 70% of the SARI cases reported for the state are concentrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A</xref>). By mapping risk at the census tract level (n=30â815) for the RMSP, we detected increasing risk starting from SÃ£o Paulo city (central region).

                <p>Differential risk to SARI in the RMSP was also associated with daily mobility levels. Before the implementation of NPIs on 13 March, mobility levels were similar across all socioeconomic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4B, C</xref>). However, 14 days after the introduction of NPIs, isolation levels were 8.2% (95% CI 7.2% to 9.2%) higher in predominantly White areas compared with predominantly Black areas. Similarly, 27 days after the introduction of state-level NPIs, isolation levels were 11.2% (95% CI 10.6% to 11.9%) higher in the wealthiest than in the poorest areas. Overall, we detected a decreasing trend in isolation levels over time, and the magnitude of the differences in social isolation levels between areas with predominantly White and Black populations decreased to only 4.4% (95% CI 3.3% to 5.5%) 151 days after the introduction of the NPIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4D</xref>).</p>
                <p>Finally, we investigated the differential risk to SARI based on workersâ position in the labour market using data from the PNAD COVID-19 survey. After the introduction of NPIs, workers employed in low-skilled jobs or essential services were more likely to keep working face to face than workers in professional or managerial positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure S4</xref>). Workers with pre-primary education were more likely to work in occupations that require in-person contact than workers with tertiary education (probability (PR): 0.89, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.90 compared with PR: 0.58, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.60) and less likely to work in occupations that allow teleworking (PR: 0.005, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.007 vs PR: 0.36, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.37, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5A</xref>). When controlling for education and formal or informal employment, we found no substantial difference between racial groups in the probability of working face to face or teleworking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5B</xref>). Nonetheless, because Black and Pardo populations are disproportionally employed in informal and low-skilled jobs, these racial groups were, in general, more likely to be working face to face during our study period.</p>

              <p>Our study shows that socially disadvantaged groups are disproportionately more likely to be hospitalised and die from SARI. We find that the differential health outcomes can be explained by structural inequities linked to the incidence of comorbidities and to socioeconomic conditions, which limit the ability of low-income and non-White populations to socially isolate and reduce their access to quality health services.</p>
              <p>Social and racial inequalities shape the risk of SARI hospitalisation and death. After the initial phase of international imports in Brazil,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Black or <italic>Pardo</italic> Brazilians and individuals residing in low-income areas were more likely to be hospitalised and die with SARI compared with White individuals and those from wealthier areas, which aligns with recent findings.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> While these results report of severe cases of infection, we find similar results when looking broadly at the population level of COVID-19 infection. Our assessment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood donors categorised by demographic background further confirms that Black Brazilians and those with lower socioeconomic status are disproportionately exposed to COVID-19.</p>
              <p>Patients hospitalised in public health facilities were more likely to die than those in private health facilities. The uneven access to health services explains some but not all the inequality in the risk of death from COVID-19, since racial inequalities in death probability persist among patients within private hospitals. Potential factors influencing this inequality include higher comorbidities among poor Black patients and the lower access to private care among low-income individuals who are disproportionately Black. Other important factors include the disadvantage of having multiple comorbidities, which are more prevalent among Blacks and <italic>Pardos</italic> and those with lower education.</p>
              <p>We found that hospitalisation risk is higher for populations living in municipalities that travel to and from the RMSP, with low income per capita and high population density compared with the rest of SÃ£o Paulo state. These populations mainly reside in the RMSP, which contains nearly half of the population in SÃ£o Paulo state and where bias in testing is evident in regions of lower socioeconomic status<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure S6</xref>). The risk of SARI hospitalisation is particularly elevated in SÃ£o Paulo city, where seroprevalence estimates from blood donors show that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were highest in older Black Brazilians and those with lower educational attainment.</p>
              <p>We show that inequalities in the risk of SARI hospitalisation were partially explained by differential mobility responses to social distancing guidelines, similar to the UA.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In wealthier and predominantly White neighbourhoods, people were able to isolate more, faster, and sustain isolation for long periods of time. We also found that occupational factors played a key role in influencing individualsâ ability to physically isolate. Among the working population, low-income and Black workers were less likely to receive a furlough from work or telework. Due to systemic inequalities in education and the labour market, these groups are disproportionately employed in precarious job positions with no social security and dependent on day-to-day income,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> limiting their ability to socially distance through telework and reductions in daily mobility. The lack of capacity to self-isolate and curtail mobility in these occupations may increase exposure and facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission.</p>
              <p>Our study has limitations that may have underestimated the level of inequality. First, geocoding cases may have discarded patients from poor census tracts where accuracy is limited.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Second, using data aggregated for various administrative levels has inherent limitations due to ecological fallacy and the modifiable areal unit problem.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Finally, the 2010 Brazilian population census and PNAD COVID-19 survey may have limited the capture of socioeconomic changes in the last decade and inclusion of extremely wealthy individuals.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Additionally, disadvantaged groups can be under-represented in health administrative records because of their lower access to healthcare. Given that SÃ£o Paulo is the wealthiest state and has the most robust healthcare system in Brazil,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> it is possible that the impact of inequalities is more severe in other states.</p>
              <p>Our findings on the difference of SARI death risk reveal stark inequalities in access to healthcare. Health is a constitutional right and a state responsibility in Brazil.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The countryâs public healthcare system (SUS) is designed to provide universal health coverage without out-of-pocket costs, and regionally planned to improve spatial coverage of services. Yet, previous studies have found that access to COVID-19 health services tends to be lower in less developed regions in the country,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 42</xref> particularly among low-income and black communities.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Only 25% of Brazilians have access to private healthcare via health insurance, reflecting how inequality in access to quality healthcare is largely driven by income.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> This leaves 75% of the population solely reliant on a chronically underfunded public healthcare system, which highlights a double disadvantage for low-income and non-White populations, who are more likely to be infected and deprived of care. Strengthening healthcare access and its capacity will be critical for reducing health inequities during this and forthcoming public health emergencies.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p>
              <p>Our findings on socioeconomic risk factors could help guide vaccine allocation in diverse settings to achieve equitable access. Ensuring that disadvantaged groups, especially those that have in-person occupations and live in crowded and deprived areas, receive vaccination will help prevent and slow down community transmission. While race is not a risk factor in itself, it is critical to consider systemic inequalities that lead Black and <italic>Pardo</italic> communities to be over-represented among low socioeconomic groups, to have higher rates of severe COVID-19 infection, and comorbidities that exacerbate their risk of death. Therefore, including disadvantaged populations among priority groups for vaccination could help reduce health inequities instead of exacerbating them.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></p>
              <p>As shown in our study, the combination of social, racial and health inequalities in fostering high mortality risk among systematically marginalised communities exemplifies the syndemic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 46</xref> The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population health is driven by the accumulation and interaction of two or more adverse conditions, often influenced by the social determinants of health.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Therefore, in order to reduce inequalities in COVID-19-related health risk, action is needed to address all factors that contribute to health inequalities. Prior to the start of the pandemic, these determinants have already shaped pre-existing living conditions of disadvantaged groupsâsuch as poor education, precarious work, residential segregation and inadequate housingâwhich disproportionately impact their access to quality healthcare and expose them to the onset of comorbidities.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47 48</xref> In order to reduce inequalities in COVID-19-related health risk, it is essential to understand what made them vulnerable in the first place by addressing the adverse social determinants that shape an individualâs life course. While a key role is played by healthcare systems, action is also required from other stakeholders. COVID-19 control measures affect people differently based on varying levels of financial resources and support available to them, thus governments and industries must work together to address these inequalities by mobilising resources and tools<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> and by developing targeted interventions at both national<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> and local levels.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p>
              <p>Our study highlights the need for additional research to comprehend the effects of social and health inequalities during pandemics. First, an assessment of the inequality in access to quality care within public and private health facilities and its risk factors is needed to better understand mortality in different hospital settings. Second, our study shows that population response to NPIs can vary significantly based on social circumstances, suggesting that future studies should also consider socioeconomic aspects when evaluating the effectiveness of NPIs. Third, more data are needed on whether social safety net programmes that are guaranteeing income for disadvantaged groups during the pandemic (eg, Brazilâs emergency cash payment) may have enabled people to reduce their mobility. Nevertheless, our study has shown the impact of social inequities on COVID-19 hospitalisation and death, thus informing future research and policies related to the health impacts of COVID-19 in Latin America.</p>
